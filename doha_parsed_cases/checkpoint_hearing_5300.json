On May 23, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On October 9, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s unfavorable clearance\ndecision under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant contends that the Judge should have concluded that the security concerns raised\nby his multiple unpaid debts had been mitigated.  In support of that contention, Applicant argues that\nhis financial problems were the result of circumstances beyond his control, loss of employment and\na divorce, and that he is disputing one of the debts.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that\nthe Judge erred.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the\nexercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-\n09462 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul.19, 2007).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not\nalone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03452 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 3,\n2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed\nthe evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).\n \nApplicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding that\nthe security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s unpaid debts had not been mitigated.  Although\nApplicant strongly disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those\nconclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a history of not meeting financial obligations\nwhich extended over many years.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, he still had five\ndelinquent debts totaling approximately $10,000, and was still in the process of trying to resolve his\nfinancial problems.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems were still ongoing and presented a security concern.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n06-00799 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 16, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the\npossible application of relevant mitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  He reasonably\nexplained why the evidence which Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to\novercome all of the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo. The\nfavorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun.\n\n3\n29, 2005).  Given the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance\ndecision under Guideline F is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

FOREMAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEmilio Jaksetic, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nAs a result of periods of unemployment, inattention to his financial situation, and the\nfinancial repercussions of a divorce, Applicant became financially overextended.  Although he\nresolved a child support arrearage and a delinquent federal tax liability, he has not resolved five\ndelinquent debts totaling about $10,256.  Security concerns based on financial considerations are\nnot mitigated.  Clearance is denied. \n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 23, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a security\nclearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and\nmodified (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006.  The SOR alleges security\nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 14, 2007.  He admitted three allegations,\ndenied two, offered explanations, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on August\n21, 2007, and heard as scheduled on September 18, 2007.  I kept the record open until September\n28, 2007, to enable Applicant to submit additional evidence.  I received two timely submissions\nfrom Applicant, and they have been admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) E and F.  DOHA\nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on September 24, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 55-year-old software manager for a defense contractor.  He has worked for\nhis current employer since July 2005.  He has about two years of college but no degree (Tr. 8).  He\nhas an interim clearance but has never held a final security clearance (Tr. 9).\nApplicant is a contract employee earning $17.00 per hour.  He does not draw a salary and\nis paid only for hours worked (GX 4 at 5).  In response to DOHA interrogatories, he submitted three\npay vouchers from October and November 2006 reflecting biweekly net pay of $24.75, $949.67, and\n$715.77 (GX 4 at 6-8).  At the hearing, he testified he has worked \u201coff and on\u201d for the past five\nyears.  His longest break between jobs was 10-12 weeks, and there were several breaks of 2-3 weeks\n(Tr. 52-53).  \nApplicant rents his home and has a car that is fully paid for (Tr. 63,66).  However, has no\nmedical insurance and only about $4,000 in his retirement account (Tr. 66).  He is a diabetic, and\nhe pays for his medications himself at a cost of about $200 per month (Tr. 67, 69). \nApplicant was married in June 1973 and divorced in September 1988.  One child was born\nduring the marriage, and Applicant was required to pay child support of $200 per month (AX A).\nAs of July 1994, he owed an arrearage of $2,500 for child support (AX B at 2).  His pay was\ngarnished in September 2000 to collect the arrearage (Tr. 64).  In August 2007, he was notified he\nowed an arrearage of $1,625 (AX C).  This notification was erroneous, because his child support\nobligation ended in December 2001 and the arrearage was satisfied by the garnishment (Tr. 55; AX\nE at 5).\n\n3\nApplicant fell behind on his federal income tax payments starting in 1993.  He negotiated\nan installment agreement with the Internal Revenue Service and satisfied his federal tax obligations\nin 2006 (AX E at 2, 7-13).\nIn February 2001, a state tax lien for $3,548 was filed against Applicant (GX 2 at 2).  The\ntax lien is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.  He admitted this debt in his answer to the SOR.  He testified no\npayments have been made on this debt because he does not have the funds and has not taken the time\nto negotiate an installment plan (Tr. 57).\nApplicant\u2019s credit report dated August 15, 2006, reflected a credit card debt of $2,369 that\nwas charged off as a bad debt (GX 3 at 1).  This debt is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b.  It arose when\nApplicant acted \u201cout of love\u201d and arranged a trip to a homecoming event for himself and a\ncompanion.  He testified he was short of funds but had good credit.  When this relationship began\nto dissolve, he became careless about his finances (Tr. 57-58).  He testified he was in the process\na trying to make payment arrangements on the debt (Tr. 58), but no evidence of a payment\narrangement has been submitted.  \nThe same credit report reflected a delinquent credit card debt of $3,225, alleged in SOR \u00b6\n1.c.  Applicant denied any knowledge of this debt, but he has taken no action to dispute or resolve\nit (Tr. 58-59). \nApplicant\u2019s credit report dated May 6, 2004, reflected a delinquent telephone bill for $80\nplaced for collection, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d (GX 2 at 2).  He denied this debt (Tr. 60).  There is no\nevidence, however, that he has taken any action to dispute it.\n \nThe same credit report reflected a credit card debt of $1,033 that was more than 120 days\npast due, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e (GX 2 at 2-3).  Although he admitted the debt in his answer to the\nSOR, he testified he had no recollection of it and had not made any payments on it (Tr. 61).  He\nbelieves he owes the debt but cannot recall how it was incurred (Tr. 69).\nApplicant testified he has been unable to pay the debts alleged in the SOR because his\nlimited income has been devoted to paying the child support arrearage and his delinquent federal\nincome taxes (Tr. 31-34).  The evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized in\nthe table below.\nSOR\nDebt\nAmount\nStatus\nEvidence\n1.a\nState tax lien\n$3,548\nUnpaid\nGX 2 at 2\n1.b\nCredit card\n$2,369\nUnpaid\nGX 2 at 3\n1.c\nCredit card\n$3,226\nUnpaid\nGX 2 at 3\n1.d\nTelephone bill\n$80\nUnpaid\nTr. 60; AX E at 14\n1.e\nCredit card\n$1,033\nUnpaid\nTr. 61, 69; GX 2 at 2-3\nApplicant testified he attempted to enroll in consumer credit counseling about two months\nbefore the hearing but was not accepted because his total indebtedness was less than $10,000 (Tr.\n\n4\n62).  However, the SOR alleges debts totaling $10,256.  After the hearing, he submitted evidence\nthat he has again applied for credit counseling (AX E at 3-4).\nApplicant is active in community affairs.  He is deeply patriotic and altruistic.  In 2006, he\nreceived a President\u2019s Volunteer Service Award for his voluntary community work (AX E at 15-17).\nHe performed volunteer work in Morocco (Tr. 51), and he received a letter of commendation for his\nwork with an international economic development organization (AX E at 18).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3\n(App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side\nof denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\n\n5\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  AG\n\u00b618.\nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying in this case.  AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \u201cinability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is raised where there is \u201cindebtedness\ncaused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or\nintent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt.\u201d  AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there\nis \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is \u201cconsistent\nspending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant\nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d  AG \u00b6 19(g) is raised\nby \u201cfailure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent\nfiling of the same.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 19(a) and (c) are raised by Applicant\u2019s financial history.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b) is raised by\nevidence that Applicant used a credit card to finance a discretionary homecoming trip when he was\nshort of funds.  He carelessly neglected the debt, and still has no realistic plan to pay it.  AG \u00b6 19(e)\nis not raised because there is no evidence of \u201cconsistent\u201d spending beyond Applicant\u2019s means.  AG\n\u00b6\u00b6 19(g) is not raised because there is no evidence of failure to file returns or fraudulent filing, but\nonly evidence of failure or inability to pay the taxes due.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (b), and (c), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of proving a\nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). This mitigating condition is not established, because Applicant\u2019s\nmultiple debts continue to persist and are likely to recur unless he can either raise his income or\nnegotiate favorable resolution of his delinquent debts.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(b).  Both\nprongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person\u2019s control and responsible conduct, must be established.\nApplicant encountered a divorce, intermittent periods of unemployment, and medical problems, all\nof which were beyond his control.  However, all the debts alleged in the SOR were incurred after\n\n6\nhis divorce.  There is no evidence his medical problems interfered with his ability to work.  His\nintermittent unemployment pattern, however, is relevant to the debts alleged in the SOR and is\nsufficient to establish the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b).  The second prong is not established, however,\nbecause he irresponsibly incurred the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b and has neglected to take any meaningful\naction to resolve it or the remaining debts alleged in the SOR.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(c).  This condition is not established,\nbecause Applicant has not yet begun a counseling program and his financial situation is not under\ncontrol.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(d).\nThis condition is not established because Applicant has not yet initiated any effort to resolve the\ndebts alleged in the SOR.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe individual has\na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(e). This condition is not established, because Applicant has\ntaken no action to dispute the credit card reports or the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.d.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a)(1)-(9).  Some of these factors are discussed above, but some merit additional comment.\nThe record reflects two significant debts for child support and federal income taxes that were\nnot alleged in the SOR.  A clearance decision may not be based on conduct not alleged in the SOR.\nISCR Case No. 01-26479 at *4, 2003 WL 227061192 (App. Bd. Sep. 16, 2003).  However, conduct\nnot alleged in the SOR may be considered: \u201c(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate\nan applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider\nwhether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular\nprovision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person\nanalysis under Directive Section 6.3.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)\n(citations omitted).  I have limited my consideration of these two debts to an evaluation of the\nreasons for Applicant\u2019s financial distress, to determine whether the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6\n20(b) and (20(d) are established, and in my whole person analysis.\nApplicant is a mature adult with 20 years of experience in his field.  At the hearing, he\npresented himself as articulate, very intelligent, and sincere.  However, he appeared overwhelmed\n\n7\nby his financial situation.  At times, he seemed to be unfamiliar with the scope and nature of his\ndebts, and he did not have a plan for resolving them.  To his credit, he resolved the child support\narrears and federal tax lien, but he remains financially overextended, making further delinquent\ndebts likely.  Although he is very sincere and undoubtedly patriotic, he is vulnerable to pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress.\nApplicant needs a clearance to continue working in his chosen field.  However, his need for\na clearance does not make him more suitable for a favorable determination.  ISCR Case No. 00-0593\nat 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2001).  The impact of a clearance decision on Applicant\u2019s career is not a\nrelevant consideration in adjudicating his security eligibility.  See ISCR Case No. 02-09220 at 5\n(App. Bd. Sep. 28, 2004).\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F, and\nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations.

Without current evidence in explanation, extenuation, or\nmitigation of her ongoing indebtedness, Applicant has failed to meet her burden of showing she is\neligible for assignment to a sensitive position. Application for a public trust position is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\n\n The subparagraph 1.a. plan petition included total assets of $172,575.00 and total liabilities of $225,921.00.\n1\nThe second petition comprised $130,450.00 in total assets and $226,421.00 in total liabilities. \n2\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On November 3, 2006, 2006, under Executive Order 10865 and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5200.6, reissued with revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) on\nSeptember 1, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the reasons for its\ntrustworthiness concerns raised under the financial considerations guideline (Guideline F) of the\nDirective. In her answer dated December 4, 2006, Applicant requested a decision be made on the\nrecord in lieu of a hearing. A copy of the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM, the\nGovernment\u2019s evidence in support of the SOR) was sent to Applicant on July 11, 2007. Applicant\nreceived the FORM on July 19, 2007. Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, was due by August 18,\n2007. No response was received. The case was assigned to me for decision on September 26, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all 23 allegations under the financial considerations guideline. Other than\nher admissions, she provided no supplemental explanations for the debts in her answer to the SOR.\nShe declined to provide a response to the FORM.\nApplicant is 34 years old, married, and has two children. After spending four years in the\nUnited States Navy (USN) between 1992 and 1996, she was employed as a customer service\nmanager for three years. Following a two-year period of unemployment, she was hired by her current\nemployer (a defense contractor) in September 2002 to work in the technical support division. She\nprovided no information about the type of work she performs or her job performance. \nThe credit bureau report in Item 7 reflects Applicant made several payments under both\nChapter 13 Bankruptcy plans  identified in subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b. of the SOR. However, both\n1\nplans were dismissed due to non-compliance (failure to make payments) with both plans. \nSubparagraph 1.c. lists an account ($226.00) the original creditor transferred to a collection\nagency in January 2006. A telephone company transferred an account valued at $102.00 (1.d.) to a\ncollection agency in May 2003. Although she claimed she tried to contact this creditor to determine\nthe actual amount of the delinquency, she provided no evidence to support her investigatory efforts.\nThe credit card account (1.e.) of $1,008.00 was charged off in February 2002. Applicant owes\nan online education program $2,382.00 (1.f.) that was charged off in January 2006. A mortgage\ncompany holds an $8,724.00 mortgage that was foreclosed in March 2006. Applicant also owes a\ngovernment educational loan organization $38,164.00 (1.h.) that was charged off in September 2005.\nThe record reflects that although the account is currently delinquent, she has made several regular\npayments. \nApplicant\u2019s car was repossessed in January 2004 (1.i.) when she stopped monthly payments\non a $15,168.00 auto installment loan. \nA delinquent credit card debt of $870.00 was charged off in May 2005. A collection debt of\n$152.00 (1.k.) was charged off in August 2006, while a telephone debt of $500.00 (1.l.) was also\n\n3\ncharged off the same month. A credit card debt (1.m.) of $425.00, and a credit card debt of $306.00\n(1.n.) has not been paid. A telephone debt of $800.00 has likewise, not been paid. \nApplicant owes two collection companies $157.00 and $630.00 respectively (1.p., 1.q.) for\ndebts that have not been paid. Applicant owes the collection agency in 1.r. ($675), and the collection\nagency in 1.s. ($114.00) for past due debts. \nApplicant owes a hospital $1,400.00 (1.t.) for medical expenses. The department store\naccount (1.u.) of $858.00 has not been paid. Neither has another telephone account (1.v., $700.00)\nor an auto loan company account (1.w.) in the amount of $8,000.00. All of the listed accounts\nbecame delinquent between 2002 and 2006. In addition to the listed debts, Applicant disclosed in\nItem 6 (answers to interrogatories dated August 17, 2006) she pays the Internal Revenue Service\n(IRS) $694.00 a month. She did not furnish an explanation for the monthly payment.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth guidelines containing disqualifying conditions (DC)\nand mitigating conditions (MC) that should be given binding consideration in making security\nclearance determinations. These conditions must be considered in every case along with the general\nfactors of the whole person concept. However, the conditions are not automatically determinative\nof the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own\ncommon sense. \nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, or may disqualify, the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d ISCR\nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct.\n7, 1993)). \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Egan, 481 U.S. at 531; see\nDirective E2.2.2.\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\nInability to pay bills in a timely fashion may lead to acts of poor judgment while trying to\ngenerate funds.\n\n4\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe failure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may\nindicate poor self-control and/or poor judgment while also raising security concerns about a person\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to safeguard classified information. Applicant filed two\nChapter 13 petitions in 2003 and 2004 with total liabilities totaling more than $225,000.00. Both\nwere dismissed. While Applicant did not specifically identify the reason for the dismissals of both\nplans, the credit bureau reports in Items 7 through 10 indicate she stopped making the mandatory\npayments. The SOR lists 23 past due accounts totaling approximately $81,360.00. These accounts\nbecame delinquent between 2002 and 2006. FC disqualifying conditions (DC) 19.a. (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) and 19.c. (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply.\nThough the two unsuccessful Chapter 13 petitions establish a bona fide effort by Applicant to repay\nher debts in 2003 and 2004, the lack of any recent effort to repay her debts definitively indicates she\nis unable to resolve her debt problems at the present time. \nAs noted in Policies, an applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in furnishing\nevidence that falls within the mitigating conditions (MC) of the FC guideline. FC MC 20.a. (the\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment) does not apply to these circumstances as two failed Chapter 13 plans in 2003 and\n2004, together with Applicant\u2019s current indebtedness continue to inflict a negative impact on her\ntrustworthiness and judgment.\nApplicant provided no explanation for her current fiscal problems. Her security clearance\napplication indicates she was unemployed for a significant period of time between 2000 and 2002.\nSince the record clearly shows Applicant was experiencing financial problems in 2002, it is fair to\nconclude she never recovered from her unemployment status, an unfortunate event that justifies some\nmitigation and extenuation under FC MC 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblems were largely beyond the person\u2019s control, and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances). \nThe other three potentially relevant conditions are inapplicable as Applicant has provided no\nevidence to justify their implementation. FC MC 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or\nis under control) is not applicable. Applicant cannot maintain payments under the Chapter 13\npetition, and has no plan to resolve these overdue debts. Though she has made a few payments to\none or two creditors, those payments occurred some time ago without recent evidence towards\nresolution of these debts. FC MC 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolved debts) does not apply. \nFinally, FC MC 20.e. (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast -due in debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate\nthe basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolved the issue) does not apply as there\nis no indication Applicant disputes any of the debts. Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.w. are found\nagainst Applicant. \nThe limited mitigation and extenuation Applicant receives under FC MC 20.b. is insufficient\n\n5\nto successfully overcome the extensive indebtedness listed in the SOR or warrant a different outcome\nwhen the debts are examined in the context of the whole person concept. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.b.\n.\nAgainst the Applicant. \nSubparagraph 1.c.\n.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.k.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.l.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.m.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.n.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.o.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.p.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.q.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.r.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.s.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.t.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.u. \nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.v.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.w.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

On March 30, 2007,\nafter considering the record, Administrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr. denied Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant\u2019s brief contains no assertion of harmful error on the part of the Judge.  Rather, the\nbrief consists of a more detailed account of the accrual of Applicant\u2019s debts\u2013along with extensive\nattachments about her bankruptcy, as well as training certificates and letters of recommendation from\nher employer.  Almost all the information Applicant provided in her brief is new information which\nshe did not provide earlier.  The Board cannot consider this new evidence on appeal.  See Directive\nE3.1.29.  \nIn her brief, Applicant states that she did not understand the depth of information requested\nfrom her earlier in the trustworthiness determination process.  Applicant had opportunities to present\nall the information she wished the Judge to consider in her trustworthiness determination.  She\nanswered DOHA Interrogatories and submitted an affidavit about her financial situation.  She\nresponded to the SOR which she received.  After the File of Relevant Material was completed in her\ncase, she submitted additional information for consideration.  That information was added to the\nrecord for the Judge\u2019s consideration.  Applicant does not contend that she did not receive adequate\ninstruction on what materials to submit or that the Judge did not consider all the information she\nsubmitted before the record was closed.  Information submitted by an applicant after the Judge has\nreached a decision is not a basis for error.  \n1\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party\nhas alleged the Judge committed harmful error.

In her June 2005 sworn statement (Item 7),\nApplicant acknowledged six debts totaling nearly $11,000 that she intended to pay or reach\nrepayment schedules for. She listed 10 debts that she disputed. She attributed the delinquent accounts\nto lowered income as a result of injuries to her husband on an unspecified date. However, a personal\nfinancial statement (PFS) completed at the same time as her statement showed positive cash flow\nof over $2,400 per month\u2014including net income from her husband of $2,100 per month. The PFS\nincluded no payments on her outstanding debts. Further, notwithstanding the positive cash flow, her\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n3\nanswers to DOHA interrogatories (Item 6) in January 2006, showed no payments on any of the\naccounts.\nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM stated that she and her husband filed a Chapter 13 Wage\nEarner Petition in December 2006 (confirmed by Item 9), and had made their first payment.\nHowever, she provided no documentation of the claimed payment, of which debts were to be paid,\nor which were to be discharged without payment. For the first time she claimed that her finances\nwere adversely affected by a two-year period of unemployment between March 1998 and March\n2000, when she stayed home after the birth of her second child.\nThere is no evidence that Applicant is receiving credit counseling or other training to help\nher avoid financial problems in the future. There is no character evidence in the record.\n \nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a trustworthiness determination. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nTrustworthiness determinations resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s request for access to sensitive information. The\ngovernment must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access to sensitive\ninformation. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no\none has a right to a trustworthiness determination, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to sensitive information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.2\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nE2.A6.1.2.1 A history of not meeting financial obligations; E2.A6.1.2.3 Inability or unwillingness to satisfy\n3\ndebts;    \nE2.A6.1.3.1 The behavior was not recent;\n4\nE2.A6.1.3.2 It was an isolated incident;\n5\nE2.A6.1.3.3 The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control. . .;\n6\nE2.A6.1.3.4 The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications\n7\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control;\nE2.A6.1.3.6 The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n8\n4\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F by demonstrating\nover 10 years of financial irresponsibility by Applicant. She did not mitigate the trustworthiness\nconcerns. She admitted over $40,000 of delinquent debt, accumulated between September 1996 and\nJanuary 2006.  Many of the debts were so small that it is simply irresponsible for Applicant to have\n3\nnot satisfied them before now, regardless of how they came to be delinquent.\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. Her financial\ndifficulties are both recent  and not isolated;  indeed they appear to be ongoing. Her husband\u2019s health\n4\n5\nissues might be considered a circumstance beyond her control,  but not knowing when his injuries\n6\noccurred makes it difficult to give this any significant weight. Further, her financial problems also\ninclude consequences of choices she has made in the past, for example voluntary unemployment for\ntwo years\u2014during which time five accounts alleged in the SOR became delinquent. In addition,\nseveral of the debts are for purchases that were frivolous. Beyond her financial irresponsibility in\naccumulating debt, she has been irresponsible in handling her debt after her finances improved. She\nhad substantial positive monthly cash flow in June 2005, yet satisfied no delinquent accounts. There\nis no evidence that she has sought credit counseling or otherwise brought the problem under control.7\nWhile her Chapter 13 Wage Earner Plan filing in December 2006 offers some possibility of financial\nimprovement, she has provided no information to gauge how extensive that relief might be, to show\nshe has the means to meet the five years of payments, or to substantiate lifestyle changes that might\ndemonstrate that she will be able to avoid financial difficulties in the future.

Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant is 36 years old and works for a company that administers government health care\nbenefits.  From approximately 1996 until 2004, he used cocaine between 40 and 100 times.  He\nvoluntarily requested an evaluation for substance abuse in 2004, and was diagnosed as cocaine\ndependent. However, he did not complete the recommended rehabilitation program or provide\nsufficient evidence to document abstinence.  He failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised\nby his drug involvement.  His eligibility for assignment to a sensitive position is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 25, 2004, Applicant submitted a public trust position questionnaire (SF-85P).  The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant an ADP I/II/III position for\nApplicant.  As required by Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, (Jan. 1987), as amended\n(Regulation), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \u00b6 E3.1.2 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on August 25, 2006, detailing the basis for\nits decisionStrustworthiness concerns under Guideline H (drug involvement) of the Directive.\nIn a sworn statement, dated September 20, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations\nand requested a hearing.  On October 16, 2006, this case was assigned to me.  A Notice of Hearing was\nissued on November 9, 2006, setting the case for hearing on November 28, 2006.  At the hearing\nDepartment Counsel introduced Government Exhibits (GX) 1S3 into evidence without objections.\nApplicant testified in his case and introduced Applicant Exhibits (AX) ASB into evidence without\nobjections.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 8, 2006.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nPrior to the commencement of the hearing Department Counsel filed a Motion to Amend the\nSOR as follows:\nIn subparagraph 1.d., replace \u201c45 days extra duty, 45 days restriction\u201d with \u201c30 days extra duty,\n30 days restriction.\u201d Applicant did not object to the Motion and I granted it.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer to the SOR and\nat the hearing, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 36 years old and has a seven-year-old child, whom he supports.  After high school,\nhe enlisted in the Army where he served from June 1988 until July 1992, which included nine months\nin Desert Storm. (Tr. 12-14)  Shortly after entering the Army (in November), he was charged with\npossessing and using cocaine after a random drug screen tested positive for cocaine.  He admitted he\nhad smoked a cocaine-laced cigarette the night before at a party.  He claimed he never used cocaine\nbefore that incident.  He received a Field Grade Article 15 punishment, which included 30 days extra\n\n3\nduty, 30 days restriction, and forfeiture of $335 for two months.  When he separated from the service\nin 1992, he received an honorable discharge.\nAfter returning home in 1992, Applicant began working as a computer specialist for a private\ntelemarketing firm. (Tr. 15)  He left the company in August 2004 as a result of the change in the laws\naffecting telemarketing.  In October 2004, he began his present position as a customer service\nrepresentative for a company that administers a government health insurance plan. (Tr. 20) \nIn between the time Applicant left his former position in August, and started his new job in\nOctober, he voluntarily entered a Veterans Administration (VA) substance abuse program for an\nevaluation for cocaine addiction.  (Tr. 17) Beginning in 1996, he started having unsettling dreams that\nhe attempted to manage by using cocaine to stay awake.  The dreams occurred about twice a month.\nHe estimated that he purchased and used cocaine 40 to 100 times from 1996 until July 2004 as a sleep\ndeterrent, and not for social purposes.  (Tr. 16) After being evaluated, the health care providers at the\nVA diagnosed him as cocaine dependent and recommended inpatient treatment.  (Tr. 19) He attended\nthe first two months of inpatient treatment and the outpatient program from the end of September to\nthe middle of November 2004.  He stopped participating in the program because he began his current\njob at the end of October, and it was incompatible with his work schedule.  He also thought he was\n\u201cokay enough to stop going.\u201d (Tr. 20) He has not participated in any sobriety program since that time\nand asserted he has not used cocaine since August 2004, when he sought an evaluation.  (Tr. 21)\nApplicant continues to have sleep related problems, sleeping only three or four hours a night.  He has\nnot obtained additional medical assistance because he does not believe it will help him.  (Tr. 22)\nApplicant stated that as a former soldier he would never divulge sensitive information relating\nto military personnel.  (Tr. 26) He has worked in the area of information systems for 13 years and has\nbeen careful with the information that comes to his attention.  (Tr. 9) He has an apartment, likes his\ncurrent job, is paying his child support, and would like to attend the local college.  (Tr. 29, 34) He has\nsome direction in his life.  (Tr. 39) He has not been involved in any criminal incidents related to drugs\nother than the 1988 charge.  (Tr. 31)\nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations from October 2004 to December 2005 indicate that he\nmeets company expectations in most categories and exceed expectations in a couple areas.  (AX A).\nHis supervisor credits him with being dependable and trustworthy. (AX B)\nPOLICIES\nPositions designated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions. Regulation\n\u00b6AP10.2.1.  ADP III positions are nonsensitive positions. Regulation AP102.3.1.  By memorandum\ndated November 19, 2004, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence and Security\ndirected DOHA to resolve all contractor cases submitted for trustworthiness determinations, including\nADP I, II, and III, under the Directive.  Thus, even though they are nonsensitive positions, ADP III\ncases are treated in the same way and adjudicated under the same guidelines and procedures as ADP\nI and II cases.\n \n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that  . . .  assigning\nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d Regulation\n\n4\n\u00b6 C6.1.1.1. Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as the disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) associated with each guideline.  DoD contractor\npersonnel are afforded the adjudication procedures contained in the Directive. Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1. \nBased upon a consideration of the evidence, the following adjudicative guideline is pertinent\nto an evaluation of this case:\nGuideline H: Drug Involvement:  A trustworthiness concern arises when an individual is\ninvolved with the improper or illegal use of drugs, which raise questions about one\u2019s willingness or\nability to protect classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational\nfunctioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI considered all of the facts in evidence and the application of the appropriate legal standards,\nincluding the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, and concluded the following with respect to the allegations set\nforth in the amended SOR:\nGuideline H: Drug Involvement\nThe Government raised a potential disqualification under disqualifiying  condition (DC) 1( Any\ndrug abuse), which includes cocaine.  Applicant admitted he used cocaine in 1988, and between 40 and\n100 times from 1996 until August 2004.\nThe Government having raised a trustworthiness concern, the burden shifted to Applicant to\nmitigate or rebut the allegations.  After reviewing the mitigating conditions (MC) under this guideline,\nI conclude MC 1 (The drug involvement was not recent), and MC 3 (A demonstrated intent not to abuse\nany drugs in the future), provide limited mitigation.  Applicant stated that he has not used cocaine for\ntwo years, is fulfilling his child support obligations, has some direction, and is performing well at his\njob, which he contends are factors demonstrating his decision not to use drugs over the past two years.\nWhile those factors are significant and support the application of two mitigating conditions, they are\ninsufficient to overcome the Government\u2019s present concern, given Applicant\u2019s extensive use and\npurchase of cocaine over an eight-year history. Consequently, I considered the remaining MC\u2019s, and\nconcluded they do not apply.  MC 2 (The drug involvement was an isolated or infrequent event) does\nnot provide additional mitigation because Applicant used cocaine in 1988, and on numerous occasions\nfrom 1996 until August 2004, which cannot be construed to be isolated or infrequent.  Although the VA\nrecommended he participate and (and presumably complete) a substance abuse program, he stopped\nattending after approximately four months; hence, MC 4 (Satisfactory completion of a drug treatment\nprogram prescribed by a credentialed medical professional), is not applicable.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each guideline, the\nadjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable information\nabout the applicant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision.\nDirective \u00b6 E.2.2.2. describes the essence of scrutinizing all appropriate variables in a case as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d In evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conduct of the applicant, an\nadministrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\n\n5\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence \nI considered the totality of the evidence in view of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, including\nApplicant\u2019s credibility and demeanor while testifying, his candid testimony about his cocaine use and\nvoluntary submission for a substance abuse evaluation.  I considered the fact that he first tried cocaine\nin 1988, and then began using it frequently and extensively from 1996 through July or August 2004.\nI gave significant weight to the fact that he was diagnosed as cocaine dependent, but decided not to\ncomplete the recommended substance abuse program or participate in ongoing rehabilitative programs\nsupportive of sobriety because it was not convenient or necessary.  I also gave great weight to his\ntestimony that he continues to experience sleep problems (that he previously managed with cocaine),\nand chooses not to seek medical treatment.  While I find his accomplishments over the last two years\ncommendable, I am not convinced that an eight-year addiction can be managed without competent\nmedical assistance and participation in programs dedicated to maintaining abstinence.  I suspect he held\nthe same belief when he sought help in 2004.  Until he presents independent corroboration from a\ncredentialed health care provider, documenting his assertions that he is drug free and has a good\nprognosis for remaining abstinent in the future, I am not sufficiently persuaded that he is capable of\nmaintaining abstinence.  I am concerned there is a strong likelihood that he will relapse into his former\nbehaviors, especially in view of his current untreated sleep problems.  Hence, Applicant did not mitigate\nthose security concerns raised by his drug involvement.  Accordingly, Guideline H is concluded against\nhim.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by\nSection E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph 1: Guideline H (Drug Involvement)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. Sd:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly not consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation.  On August 10, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline\nH (Drug Involvement), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided upon the written record.  The SOR\n\nAccordingly, the Board need not address Applicant\u2019s argument on appeal that she did not intentionally falsify\n1\nher Public Trust Positions (Standard Form 85P).\nApplicant\u2019s Brief at 2-3.\n2\n2\nwas amended on the motion of the government without objection by the Applicant to delete the\nallegation under Guideline E and in paragraph 4.c.   On November 30, 2006, after considering the\n1\nrecord, Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness\ndesignation.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ntrustworthiness determination under Guidelines H, G and J is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\nlaw.\nApplicant asks that the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness determination be reversed, or in the\nalternative that she be granted a probationary or condition trustworthiness designation with the\nproviso that she submit to random drug and alcohol testing.  In support of her request, Applicant\nstates that \u201ceveryone makes mistakes,\u201d and that \u201cI no longer drink alcohol nor use marijuana and I\nhave no intention of doing so in the future.\u201d   She also argues that she has been a good employee,\n2\nand that there is no connection between her prior drug and alcohol problems and her ability to\nperform her job and protect sensitive information.  Finally, Applicant argues that she erred in telling\nthe government that she had used marijuana from 1990 to 2005, when in fact she had only used it\nfrom 1998 to 2005.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred. \nThe federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to\nproperly handle sensitive information before it can deny or revoke access to such information.  See\nAdams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  An\napplicant with good or exemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has negative\ntrustworthiness implications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0123 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2000).  The\nDirective's Guidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty conduct and circumstances which\nare of trustworthiness concern to the government and mandate a whole person analysis to determine\nan applicant's trustworthiness eligibility.  A whole-person analysis is not confined to the workplace.\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-11231 at 3 (June 4, 2004).\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).   The Board does not review a case de novo.  Considering the record evidence as a whole,\nthe Judge\u2019s material findings with respect to Applicant\u2019s marijuana use reflect a plausible\ninterpretation of the record evidence and are sustainable.  Moreover, even if it were assumed that\nApplicant\u2019s revised statement as to her prior marijuana use was correct, it would not have materially\naffected the outcome of the case.\n \n\n3\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the\nexercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-\n14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone\ncompel the Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness determination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge\nhas to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Applicant has not met her burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the trustworthiness concerns presented by Applicant\u2019s prior conduct and circumstances had not\nbeen mitigated.  Although Applicant strongly disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, she has not\nestablished that those conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.32.3.\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of illegal\nmarijuana use and excessive alcohol consumption.  That history included arrests on drug and/or\nalcohol-related charges in 1998, 2004 and 2005.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).  The Judge weighed the mitigating\nevidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and\nconsidered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions.  She reasonably explained why\nthe evidence Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s\ntrustworthiness concerns.  As noted above, the Board does not review a case de novo.  Given the\nrecord that was before her, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable trustworthiness determination under\nGuidelines H, G, and J is sustainable.  There is no authority to grant a trustworthiness designation\non a conditional or probationary basis.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-04302 at 5 (App. Bd. June 30,\n2005).  Thus, the Judge did not err in denying Applicant a trustworthiness designation.\n\n4\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a trustworthiness designation is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

He deliberately failed to \ndisclose the following offenses: the August 1996 DUI, DUS and Open Container \ncharges; the April 1998 DUI and DUS charges; the December 1998 DUI, DUS and \nOpen Container charges, and the November 1999 DUS and Failure to Yield charges.  \n \nApplicant completed an SF 85P on August 17, 2004. In response to question 20 \nwhich asked Applicant if he had been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any \noffenses in the last 7 years (leaving out traffic fines less than $150) he listed a DUI in \nOctober 2001 and a DUS in December 2000. He deliberately failed to disclose that he \nhad been arrested other times in that time period, to wit: April 1998 for DUI and DUS, \nDecember 1998 for DUI, DUS, and Open Container, and November 1999 for DUS and \nFailure to Yield.3  \n \nApplicant completed a signed and sworn statement on April 14, 2005, which was \npresented to an authorized investigator for the Department of Defense. He falsified \nmaterial facts in that he stated he quit using alcohol in October 2002 and deliberately \nfailed to disclose that he continued to drink alcohol to at least 2004.4  \n \nIn response to interrogatories sent to Applicant by DOHA in November 2006, \nApplicant falsified material facts in that he stated he had stopped drinking alcohol in \n \n3 Item 4. \n \n4 Item 5. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nOctober 2002, when in fact, he failed to disclose he continued to consume alcohol to at \nleast 2004.5  \n \nApplicant\u2019s falsifications and omissions constitute a violation of Federal law, Title \n18 USC, Section 1001, felonies.  \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201dapplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness decision.\u201d  \n \n \n5 Item 8. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22, and \nespecially considered the following: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as \nan alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent. \n \nApplicant drank alcohol to excess and to the point of intoxication from 1975 to at \nleast 2004. He has had four DUI convictions and five other arrests, some were for \nalcohol-related offenses. I find the above disqualifying condition applies.  \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 including the \nfollowing: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \n\n \n6 \n \n \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); and  \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with a treatment recommendation, such as \nparticipation in meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization \nand has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofession or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a \nrecognized alcohol treatment program.  \n \nAppellant had numerous alcohol-related incidents in his past from 1988 to 2001. \nThe most recent one reported was in 2001. Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR \nacknowledges he does not drink hard liquor, but continues to consume beer. Although a \nsignificant period of time has passed since his last criminal alcohol-related incident, \nwithout additional independent evidence as to his present consumption, I cannot find \nthat his alcohol use will not be a recurring problem or not have a detrimental effect on \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find AG \u00b6 23(a) does not apply. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant acknowledges his issues with alcohol or has taken \nactions to overcome his problem. No corroborative evidence was provided to convince \nme that he has abstained from alcohol consumption or established a modified pattern of \nconsumption. Applicant provided information that he attended a court appointed alcohol \nawareness program some time in the 2000 decade. There is insufficient evidence to \ndetermine that Applicant\u2019s issues with alcohol are under control. I find none of the above \nmitigating conditions apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and especially considered the following: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative;  \n(c) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to considerations of: \u2026 (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations; and  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant was arrested in June 1994, and charged with DUS. He was \nfound guilty and was sentenced. He was arrested again in November 1999, for \nFailure to Yield and DUS. He was found guilty of both and sentenced. Applicant\u2019s \nconduct rises to the level of establishing questionable judgment and a pattern of \nrule violations. His conduct creates a vulnerability and potentially could affect his \npersonal, professional or community standing. I find disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 \n16(c) and 16(e) apply.  \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his complete history of arrests, \ncharges, and convictions on his October 30, 2002 and August 17, 2004, SF \n85Ps. He also provided false material facts to a Department of Defense \ninvestigator in a sworn statement on April 14, 2005, in which he stated he had \nstopped consuming alcohol in October 2002, when in fact he deliberately failed to \ndisclose that he continued to drink alcohol to at least 2004. He provided another \nfalse statement in the interrogatories provided to DOHA, stating the he stopped \ndrinking alcohol in October 2002, when in fact he admitted that he continued to \nconsume alcohol until at least 2004. I find disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) \nand 16(b) apply. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions and especially considered the following under AG \u00b6 17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \nI have considered all of the facts and information provided. There is no evidence \nthat Applicant made a prompt good-faith effort to correct his omissions or falsifications. \nAG \u00b6 17 (a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his complete criminal record \nand alcohol-related incidents is not minor, but serious. No evidence was presented to \nconclude that his omissions, falsifications, and criminal actions occurred under unique \ncircumstances that are unlikely to recur. I find AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. There is no \nevidence indicating that Applicant has acknowledged his alcohol-related problems, \nobtained counseling, or taken positive steps to alleviate the stressors and underlying \nbehaviors related to criminal offenses and abuse of alcohol. Without sufficient \nindependent evidence, I cannot conclude that his behavior is unlikely to recur. I find \nmitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) and 17(e) do not apply.  \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 sets out the security concern relating to criminal conduct:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person=s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under Criminal Conduct AG \u00b6 31 \nand especially considered the following: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \nApplicant has four DUI convictions, four DUS convictions, and convictions for \nmany other minor offenses. He was involved in an alcohol-related accident in October \n2001, and was charged with DUI. Applicant admitted in his answer to the SOR that he \ndeliberately omitted relevant information pertaining to his police record and alcohol \nconsumption on his SF 85Ps and provided false information to investigators, in violation \n\n \n9 \n \n \nof Title 18 U.S. C. 1001, a felony offense. I find all of the above disqualifying conditions \napply. \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and especially considered the following: \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nA significant period of time has elapsed since Applicant\u2019s last alcohol-related \ncriminal behavior in 2001. However, Applicant\u2019s omissions and falsifications on his 2002 \nand 2004 SF 85P and official statements in 2005 and 2006 reflect a pattern of \ndishonesty in disclosing his past misconduct. Under the circumstances, I find his \ndeliberate falsifications cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Therefore, I find mitigating condition AG\u00b6 32(a) does not apply. Insufficient \nevidence was presented to conclude there is successful rehabilitation. I find mitigating \ncondition AG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \n\n \n10 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a significant criminal \nhistory beginning in 1988 and primarily involving alcohol-related incidents. Although the \npassage of time without a criminal incident weighs in Applicant\u2019s favor, he failed to \nprovide sufficient and independent evidence to document his current alcohol \nconsumption and refute potential alcohol-related concerns. An additional and serious \nconcern is Applicant\u2019s deliberate failure to disclose his entire criminal arrest and \nconviction record on his SF 85Ps, and his dishonest answers during discussions of his \npast alcohol consumption information. His willingness to omit and falsify information is a \nserious concern because the Government relies on applicant\u2019s to provide honest \ninformation about their background. Failure to do so raises concerns that they may not \nbe honest when they have access to sensitive information. Applicant failed to provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns. Overall the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for \naccess to sensitive information. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct, and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.f: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a-3b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

He has paid two\nsmaller debts and negotiated payment plans for the remaining two.  He is receiving financial\ncounseling, has a steady job, and his spouse has found work outside the home.  Security concerns\nbased on financial considerations are mitigated.  Clearance is granted.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a\nsecurity clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992),\nas amended and modified (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) approved by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006.  The SOR alleges\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), based on four debts, including a\nstate tax lien, totaling about $16,600.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 27, 2006, and admitted the allegations.\nOn June 24, 2007, he requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on July 16, 2007, and heard\non August 17, 2007, as scheduled.  I kept the record open until August 31, 2007, to enable Applicant\nto submit additional documentary evidence.  I received his evidence on August 27, 2007, and it has\nbeen admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) L, without objection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.)\non August 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He is married and has three\nchildren.  He has held a clearance since September 1997.\nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from March 1995 to May 2003.  He\nreceived a clearance in the Air Force and has held one continuously for about 12 years (Tr. 42-45).\nApplicant and his wife began living apart in March 2003.  His children lived with his wife,\nand he lived with his father.  His wife was not employed outside the home (Tr. 56).  He sent his wife\nabout $500 every two weeks when he was employed (Tr. 51-53). \nAfter being released from active duty, he joined the Air National Guard.  He served on full-\ntime active duty with the National Guard for one month after his release from active duty (Tr. 49).\nAfter Applicant completed his one month on full-time active duty with the National Guard, he was\nunemployed until September 2003, and his only income was about $200 in military pay for  inactive\nduty training (Tr. 49).  In September 2003, he was employed by a defense contractor and began\nreceiving net monthly pay of about $3,200.  \nIn November 2004, Applicant\u2019s in-laws were involved in an accident while driving\nApplicant\u2019s motor vehicle.  The vehicle was a total loss, but the insurance paid only the market value\nof the vehicle, which was less than the balance on Applicant\u2019s loan.  His in-laws did not reimburse\nhim for the deficiency (Tr. 62-63).  He stopped making payments on the car loan in early 2006 (Tr.\n65).  The deficiency of about $11,000 is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d.  Applicant negotiated a payment plan\n\n4\nand has reduced the unpaid balance to $8,393 (Tr. 74; AX A; AX C).  The payments are deducted\nautomatically from his bank account (Tr. 79).\nApplicant left his job in July 2005 and moved to the state where his wife and children were\nresiding.  His in-laws purchased a home, and he intended to live in the home with his family.  He\npromised to pay $1,600 per month, about half the mortgage payment (Tr. 59).  He was unable to find\nemployment at his new location.  He returned to his current location in September 2005, and he was\nhired by his present employer in November 2005 (Tr. 60).  \nApplicant no longer makes payments on his in-laws\u2019 home.  His in-laws live in the home but\nhave defaulted on the payments (Tr. 125-26).\nApplicant and his wife resumed living together in April 2006 (Tr. 66), after he began his\ncurrent job.  They lived with Applicant\u2019s father for about two months (Tr. 62).  They began renting\ntheir home in June 2006, paying $1,700 per month (Tr. 67).\nThe tax lien alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was the result of Applicant claiming ten exemptions on his\ntaxes instead of the four he was entitled to.  His rationale was to reduce the tax withholding to make\nmore money available to pay other bills, not realizing that he would owe more taxes at the end of the\nyear.  He thought the plan would work because, even with ten exemptions, he was receiving a federal\ntax refund (Tr. 85-89).  He did not consult with any tax advisors or financial advisors about the\nconsequences of his plan (Tr. 89-90).  He did not believe that he violated any tax laws by inflating\nhis exemptions.  He has negotiated an agreement to pay $165 per month to resolve this debt (AX H).\nThe evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized in the table below.\nSOR\nDebt\nAmount\nStatus\nEvidence\n1.a\nState tax lien\n$4,207\nPaying $165 per month\nsince Oct. 2006\nAX H \n1.b\nLibrary bill\n$68\nPaid, Oct. 15, 2006\nGX 6 at 1; AX E\n1.c\nDental bill\n$1,288\nPaid, Aug. 2, 2007\nAX B, AX L\n1.d\nCar loan\nOriginally\n$11,038,\nnow $8,393\nPaying monthly since\nMay 2006 (between $50-\n$300 per month)\nGX 5 at 2; GX 6 at 2;\nAX C\nIn August 2006, Applicant prepared a personal financial statement in response to DOHA\ninterrogatories.  He reported net monthly income of $5,144, expenses of $2,850, debt payments of\n$313 (including the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d), and a remainder of $1,980.  He did not\nreport any spousal income.  At the hearing, he testified his net monthly income is about $4,400, and\nhis spouse had been employed for about ten months, with a net monthly income of about $2,400 (Tr.\n118).\nApplicant\u2019s wife drives a car titled in her name only, on which the monthly payments are\n$479.  Applicant does not own a car, but he drives a car owned by his father (Tr. 115-16).\n\n5\nFor most of their married lives, Applicant\u2019s wife managed the family finances because her\norganizational skills were better than Applicant\u2019s.  However, while they were separated, Applicant\ndid not have the benefit of her skills (Tr. 100).  Applicant recently obtained debt counseling from\nhis credit union and is learning to budget and track expenses (Tr. 96-97).\nA family friend who has known Applicant for about 20 years and who has been a government\ncontractor with a clearance for about 23 years testified he hired Applicant to handle the information\ntechnology at his local church.  He described Applicant as knowledgeable, responsible , and a person\nof high integrity and moral character (Tr. 136-43).\nA special security agent for a federal agency who has known Applicant since elementary\nschool described Applicant as very trustworthy and reliable.  The agent testified he had also faced\nlosing his clearance because of financial considerations.  He was aware of Applicant\u2019s financial\ndifficulties and his efforts to resolve them.  He testified he had no hesitation supporting Applicant\u2019s\napplication for continuation of his clearance (Tr. 145-57).\nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor for the past two years described Applicant as \u201ca model\nemployee and of good character.\u201d  He regards Applicant as very dependable, morally sound, a good\nleader, and a devoted father and husband  (AX K).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\n\n6\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe concern under Guideline F is as follows: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is\nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  AG \u00b618.\nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying in this case.  AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \u201cinability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is raised where there is \u201cindebtedness\ncaused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or\nintent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt.\u201d  AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there\nis \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is \u201cconsistent\nspending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant\nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d  AG \u00b6 19(g) is raised\nby \u201cfailure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing\nof the same.\u201d  \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were not the result of frivolous or irresponsible spending or\nconsistent spending beyond his means.  Instead, they were the result of periods of unemployment,\nsome bad financial decisions, and the unexpected destruction of his car by his in-laws.  Thus, I\nconclude AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b) and (e) are not raised.  However, his financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and\n(c).  Further, his intentional overstatement of tax exemptions to avoid tax withholding raises AG \u00b6\n19(g).\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (g), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of proving a\nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing the conduct was\n\u201cso long ago,\u201d or \u201cso infrequent,\u201d or \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.\u201d\nIf any of the first three disjunctive prongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully\nestablished unless the conduct \u201cdoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(a).\n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent, multiple, and still not fully resolved.  They were caused by an\nunfortunate car accident, marital strife and separation, and periods of unemployment.  However, now\nthat Applicant and his wife are reconciled and living together, they are both gainfully employed, and\nhe is obtaining help in overcoming his financial ineptitude, the circumstances causing the problem\nare not likely to recur.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(b).  Both\nprongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person\u2019s control and responsible conduct, must be established.\nApplicant\u2019s marital problems and his in-laws\u2019 car accident were circumstances beyond his\ncontrol.  However, his decision to leave his job and move to an area where he had no job, and his\ndecision to manipulate the tax system were not responsible.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is not\nestablished.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(c).  It the person has received counseling, it must\nalso be shown that there are clear indications the problem is being resolved or under control.\nHowever, if the person has not received counseling, this mitigating condition may still apply if there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control.  The evidence indicates\nApplicant had his financial problems under control before obtaining debt counseling.  The\ncounseling is focused on preventing future problems rather than solving past problems.  I conclude\nAG \u00b6 20(c) is established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline can also be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(d).\nApplicant has paid the library bill and dental bill, and he negotiated payment plans for the state tax\nlien and the car loan.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is established.\nApplicant\u2019s deliberate overstatement of state tax exemptions resulted in inadequate\nwithholding from his pay and amounted to an unauthorized loan of funds from the state.  It was\nfoolish, because it caused a tax liability he could not afford to pay.  I am satisfied, however, that\nApplicant did not realize his actions were fraudulent and possibly illegal.\n\n8\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a)(1)-(9).  \nApplicant is a mature adult with many years of honorable military service.  He also has held\na clearance for many years, apparently without incident.  For most of his married life, he relied on\nhis spouse to manage the family finances.  When he encountered marital strife and was temporarily\nseparated from his spouse, he fell into financial difficulty because of unemployment, the unexpected\nloss of his car, and his financial ineptitude.  \nApplicant was sincere, candid, and credible at the hearing.  He has recognized his ineptitude\nand sought counseling.  His marriage and his career appear to be back on track.  He is no longer\nvulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.  The likelihood of recurrence is low.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating\nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcerns based on financial considerations.  Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of\nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue his security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. Clearance is granted.\nLeRoy F. Foreman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Michael Lyles, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nDavid M. Duwel, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 19, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n\nApplicant used marijuana, sometimes on a weekly basis, from 1968 to 1994.  He purchased it between 1968\n1\nand 1985, and sold it in high school and college.  Applicant used hashish in high school and college, his last use\noccurring in 1993.  He used \u201cspeed\u201d in college and cocaine on three occasions in 1993 and tried LSD 25 times between\n1969 and 1974.  Applicant used heroin and morphine in 1974.  Some of his drug use occurred while he held a security\nclearance.  Decision at 2.\n2\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On July 30, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Philip S. Howe denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding\nApplicant\u2019s falsification of his security clearance application was deliberate; whether the Judge\u2019s\nunfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines E and J is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\n(1) Applicant argues that he did not deliberately falsify two security clearance applications\nand several signed, sworn statements by failing to disclose his prior drug usage.  In support of that\nargument, Applicant contends that his omissions were the result of a mistake and that he had no\nreason to hide his past drug use.   Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\n1\nIn this case, Applicant omitted information of obvious security concern from two security\nclearance applications and several signed, sworn statements.  He gave multiple, inconsistent reasons\nfor his omissions.  The Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanations for why he\nfailed to disclose the information in question.  The Judge was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept\nor reject Applicant\u2019s explanations.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanations in light of the\nrecord evidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s\nomissions were deliberate and intentional.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate\nfalsification is sustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n(2) Applicant also argues that the Judge should have concluded, as a matter of law, that the\nsecurity concerns raised by his multiple falsifications were mitigated by Applicant\u2019s favorable\nevidence.  As part of his argument, Applicant notes that: (a) his prior drug use is so old that it is no\nlonger of security concern, (b) the government knew of his prior drug use during earlier\ninvestigations and had still granted him a clearance, and (c) he has held a clearance for a number of\nyears without any adverse incidents.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nPrior security clearance adjudications and the granting of clearances for the Applicant have\nno bearing on the legal sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision here. See, e.g, ISCR\nCase No. 03-04927 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 4, 2005).   The government is not estopped from making an\nadverse clearance decision when there were prior favorable adjudications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n01-24506 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 11, 2003).  In that regard, the government has the right to reconsider\nthe security significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct or\ncircumstances having negative security significance.  See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 91-0775 at 3 (App.\nBd. Aug. 25, 1992); ISCR Case No. 02-17609 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).\n\n3\nThe absence of security violations does not bar or preclude an adverse security clearance\ndecision.  The federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to\nproperly handle classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such information.  See\nISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007) citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239\n(D.C. Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970). An applicant with good or exemplary job\nperformance may engage in conduct that has negative security implications. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n99-0123 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2000).  The Directive's Guidelines set forth a variety of examples\nof off-duty conduct and circumstances which are of security concern to the government and mandate\na whole-person analysis to determine an applicant's security eligibility.  A whole-person analysis is\nnot confined to the workplace.  See ISCR Case No. 03-11231 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2004). \nThe existence of any record of a prior investigation is irrelevant to Applicant's duty to be\ntruthful with the government when he was asked about his past. Likewise, Applicant's state of\nknowledge as to the existence of any record of a prior investigation is irrelevant to his duty to fully\ndisclose his past conduct of security concern when asked. To the extent that Applicant is arguing that\nthese facts provide mitigation for his falsifications in this case, his position lacks merit.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 99-0381 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 23, 2000).  Similarly, inasmuch as Applicant\u2019s prior\ndrug use was sufficiently mitigated by the passage of time so as to obviate any residual security\nconcerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) that did not constitute evidence of mitigation as to\nthe Guideline E and J security concerns raised by his recent falsifications.\nOnce there has been a concern articulated regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance\neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\nSee Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).\nth\nAfter the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant\nto establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts\nof a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record\nevidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the\npresence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security\nclearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide\nwhether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 06-06459 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not\nsufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 2 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).\nThe Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s falsifications had not been mitigated.  Although\nApplicant strongly disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those\nconclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  The Judge\nweighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the recency and seriousness of the\ndisqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions and\nwhole-person factors.  He reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented\nin mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not\nreview a case de novo.  The favorable  evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate\nthe Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041\n\n4\nat 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).

Duwel, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant is 57 years old, married to his fourth wife, and they have eight children.  He has\na Ph.D. in electrical engineering and works for a defense contractor.  He failed to disclose his 1969\nto 1994 illegal drug use on his security clearance applications in 1996 and 2005.  He admits he\navoided disclosing that information, and that he lied on the 1996 application.  Applicant failed to\nmitigate the personal conduct and criminal conduct security concerns.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.  As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January 19, 2007\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\nand Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on 29\nDecember 2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense effective 1 September 2006.  The\nrevised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.  Applicant answered the\nSOR in writing on February 16, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.\nThe case was assigned to me on May 2, 2007.  I convened a hearing on June 5, 2007, to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 21, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated here as findings of fact.  After\na complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 57 years old, married for the fourth time, and has eight children with his present\nwife.  He has an older daughter from a prior marriage.  He has a Ph.D. in electrical engineering.  He\nworks on computers for a defense contractor.  He had a security clearance in 1977 and 1978, and\nthen again in 1984 and 1985. (Tr. 26, 31, 32; Exhibits 1, 3, 4)\nApplicant first used marijuana in 1968.  His last use was in December 1994.  He used it on\nweekends in college between 1969 and 1971.  After that time, he continued to use it, but less\nfrequently, often monthly.  From 1973 to 1988, he used it three to five times per year.  He purchased\nmarijuana between 1968 and 1985, and sold it in high school and college.  He also used hashish in\nhigh school and college.  Between 1975 and 1981, he used hashish sporadically, and then reduced\nhis use to four or five times annually between 1980 and 1981.  His most recent use was in 1993.  He\nadmits he may have used \u201cspeed\u201d in college, and used cocaine three times in 1983.  He tried LSD\n25 times between 1969 and 1974.  He injected heroin and morphine at least once in 1974.  Applicant\nadmitted in his statement of December 17, 1996, that he used illegal drugs while holding a security\nclearance in the past, from 1977 to 1978, and 1984 to 1985. (Tr. 18, 26, 32; Exhibits 3, 5)\n\n3\nOn May 28, 1996, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA).  He answered\n\u201cno\u201d to Question 27 about any illegal drug use in the past seven years.  He answered Question 31\nby disclosing his past security clearances.  He gave a statement to a Government investigator on\nDecember 17, 1996, about his life experiences, including a detailed history of his illegal drug use\nfrom 1969 to 1996.  On August 31, 2005, Applicant completed his latest SCA and in answer to\nQuestion 24 about his illegal drug use in the past seven years, whether he had \u201cever\u201d used a\n\u201ccontrolled substance while possessing a security clearance,\u201d and whether in the past seven years he\nwas involved in the illegal sale, manufacture, etc., of any illegal drug, all three subparts of that\nquestion, he gave a negative answer.  Question 26 asked Applicant if he had ever been investigated\nfor a security clearance or been granted one.  He answered \u201cyes.\u201d  Both SCA contained certification\nareas for Applicant\u2019s signature, in which he stated his answers on the SCA were true, complete,\naccurate, and correct, and that a knowing and willful false statement could be punished by a fine or\nimprisonment under Federal law.  Applicant signed both SCA. (Tr. 20-29; Exhibits 1, 4)\nApplicant admitted in his December 17, 1996, statement to the Government investigator that\nhe deliberately falsified his answers to Question 27 about his past illegal drug use, and admits he\n\u201clied.\u201d  In his Interrogatories signed November 27, 2006, Applicant stated that he answered \u201cno\u201d to\nQuestion 24b on his August 2005, SCA because, \u201cThis is part of my past.  For years, I have voided\n(sic) talking about my drug past.  This is the reason I said \u201cno\u201d to the question.\u201d  At the hearing,\nApplicant claimed he misinterpreted Question 24b, thinking it referred back only seven years, as\nQuestions 24a and 24b did.  Applicant admitted at the hearing the answer to Question 24b should\nhave been \u201cyes,\u201d and he  should have answered Question 27 in 1996 with a \u201cyes.  He could not\nremember why he answered \u201cno\u201d then. (Tr. 20-29; Exhibits 1, 3-5)\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information with Industry\n\u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\nsecurity guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In\nevaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the\nadjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or.\n\n4\n10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and\nthe Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. \nIn evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also\nassess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nand the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). Because each security\ncase presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors\nexhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover,\nalthough adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as\nto the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  All that\nis required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling\nclassified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No.\n00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established\na prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  See Exec. Or. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct: The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of\n\n5\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \u00b615\nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct: The Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a\nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \u00b630\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nThis cases depends heavily on Applicant\u2019s credibility.  On two SCA he deliberately failed\nto disclose his past illegal drug use.  Looking at the two SCA from 1996 and 2005, no one would\nknow of his extensive drug use history.  He admitted he deliberately lied in 1996 when confronted\nby the Government investigator.  He admitted on the Interrogatories in 2006 that he deliberately\nfailed to disclose his drug use history again because it was in his past and he willfully avoided\ntalking about his drug use history.  He also failed to fully disclose information to the Government\ninvestigator in 1996 about his LSD and marijuana use.\nWhile Applicant\u2019s attorney attempts to mitigate these deliberate falsifications by stating the\nGovernment learned of them in 1996 during the investigation and gave Applicant a security\nclearance, the issuance of one clearance is not an automatic guarantee of a subsequent one.  The SCA\nasked Applicant in 2005 to give truthful answers, and he certified on the SCA his answers were true,\ncomplete, and correct.  Yet they were not.  Again, Applicant deliberately hid his past illegal drug use.\nApplicant has a Ph.D. in electrical engineering.  He now claims he misinterpreted Question\n24b.  With his education level, and the type of work he does, if he misreads or misinterprets manuals\nand instructions, he could do himself and others harm.  Someone that well educated cannot claim\nhe cannot read a simple question on a government form, especially one that had the keyword \u201cever\u201d\nunderlined as it does.  \nThe Government established its prima facie case.  I conclude the Disqualifying Conditions\napplicable are \u00b616a involving \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, or determine trustworthiness,\u201d \u00b616b\nby \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an\ninvestigator or other official government representative,\u201d and \u00b616e \u201cpersonal conduct, or\nconcealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s\npersonal, professional, or community standing.\u201d  Applicant is not credible in his explanations about\nwhy he failed to make full disclosure of his drug use history.  His testimony at the hearing\ndemonstrated a lack of contrition for his actions, or no remorse for his falsifications.  His attempts\nto explain how he, as a Ph.D. holder, could not understand Question 24b, and could not remember\nwhen he had previous security clearances, were not persuasive or believable.\n\n6\nI examined the Mitigating Conditions in \u00b617.  Applicant made no efforts to correct his\nconcealment.  His 1996 statement was made only after the Government investigator confronted him.\nIn November 2006, his statement clearly was that he avoided telling anyone about his drug history,\nshowing a conscious, willful, and knowing concealment and falsification.  There was no bad advice\ngiven him.  His drug history was not minor, or infrequent, nor were there unique circumstances.  He\nclaims he has not used illegal drugs since December 1994, but he also admitted he is a liar, so he is\nnot believable.  He has not obtained any type of drug counseling to verify his claimed present\nabstinence, nor has he demonstrated any positive steps he took to reduce his vulnerability.  None of\nthe other Mitigating Conditions remotely could be applicable.  The burden of proof of Mitigating\nCondition applicability is on Applicant, and he showed nothing to support a contention that any\nmight apply.\nGuideline J\u2014Criminal Conduct\nApplicant committed a series of offense involving illegal drug use between 1969 and 1994,\nat least.  There are allegations of these offenses, regardless of whether he was formally charged,\nformally prosecuted or convicted.  He admitted he lied on the 1996 SCA and the 2005 SCA because\nhe avoids disclosing his drug use history.  Disqualifying Conditions \u00b631a and \u00b631c apply.\nConsidering the mitigating conditions under \u00b632, while time has elapsed since Applicant\nclaims he last used illegal drugs, he continues to lie about his history.  There is not evidence of any\nrehabilitation for his mendacity on the SCA.  While \u00b632(a) and \u00b632(d) might have applied, there is\nno mitigating evidence to support them.  None of the other mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201cEach\nsecurity clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3. \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). In\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the AG \u00b6\n2(a).\nApplicant\u2019s age and educational level show he was mature at the time he committed the\nfalsifications.  He should have known better than to falsify his SCA after having answered\ninvestigator\u2019s questions in 1996, based on his age and education.  He lied to the Government\ninvestigator in 1996 about his drug history.  His drug use was extensive, and he continues to lie\nabout it to the Government.  His mendacity was voluntary and repeated.  His motivation for lying\nwas to retain his job and hide his past.  There is substantial potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, and duress in such circumstances.  He repeated his lying twice, so there is the great\nlikelihood that he will repeat it again.  He has shown he does not have the self-discipline and\nintegrity to be trusted with classified information, and that he is unreliable.\n\n7\nI conclude the Personal Conduct security concern against Applicant.  I conclude the Criminal\nConduct security concern against Applicant.  I conclude the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d against\nApplicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nPhilip S. Howe\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On March 6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\n1\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating security concerns under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline\nJ (Criminal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended,\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nDecember 10, 2008\n\n Ex. 1 (SF-86, dated Dec. 23, 2004, at 3).\n2\n2\nIn a response notarized on June 4, 2008, Applicant admitted twelve of fourteen\nallegations regarding finances, one of six allegations concerning personal conduct, two\nof four allegations raised under the guideline for criminal conduct, and requested a\nhearing before a DOHA administrative judge. DOHA initially assigned the case to\nanother administrative judge on July 11, 2008, but the case was transferred to me on\nAugust 18, 2008, for caseload considerations. Applicant and Department Counsel\nagreed on a September 17, 2008, hearing date and a notice to that effect was issued\non August 25, 2008. That notice was amended on August 27, 2008, to correct an error\nin the hearing venue address.\n \nThe hearing took place as scheduled. Department Counsel moved to amend\nSOR allegations 3b and 3c by correcting a date. With no objection, the motion was\ngranted. Department Counsel submitted eight exhibits (Ex.), accepted into the record as\nExs. 1-7 and Demonstrative Exhibit (DE) 1. Applicant testified on his own behalf. No\nwitnesses were called and no exhibits were offered into evidence. Applicant was given\nuntil September 26, 2008, to submit any additional materials. On October 3, 2008,\nDepartment Counsel forwarded one document, timely submitted by Applicant on\nSeptember 22, 2008. Without objection, it was accepted into evidence as exhibit (Ex.)\nA. The transcript (Tr.) was received on October 7, 2008, and the record was closed.\nBased upon a review of the case file, exhibits, and testimony, security clearance is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 42-year-old heavy equipment mechanic working for a government\ncontractor. He has worked for the same employer for four years. Applicant has a high\nschool diploma and has completed some college-level courses. Divorced, Applicant is\nthe father of two adult children. \nFrom 1984 through 1997, Applicant served in the U.S. Navy. While in the\nservice, in 1994, he visited his estranged first wife to fix one of their children\u2019s bicycles.\nWhen his wife\u2019s boyfriend appeared, an altercation ensued. He was charged with\ncarrying a concealed weapon, misdemeanor simple assault, and misdemeanor second\ndegree trespass. Although a trial date was set, the case ultimately was dismissed. \nAfter Applicant was honorably discharged in 1997, he was given custody of his\nchildren. His first wife, from whom he was divorced in January 1995,  was ordered to\n2\npay him $365 a month for child support. About 18 months later, the court ordered that\nthe parents share custody jointly. Up to this point, Applicant was in good standing with\nhis creditors. While Applicant retained physical custody of the children during the school\nyear, child support payments were discontinued. Applicant\u2019s finances became strained\nas he struggled to raise the children on his single salary. Then, in August 2002, he\nexperienced a seven month period of unemployment. Although unemployed, he went\n\n Tr. 41-42.\n3\n Tr. 49.\n4\n Tr. 59.\n5\n Tr. 48.\n6\n Tr. 60.\n7\n Tr. 56-60.\n8\n3\nthrough with his marriage to his second wife in April 2002. Finances were tight,\nhowever, and he almost lost his home. Some of his accounts became delinquent.\nWhile \nunemployed, \nApplicant \nreceived \nunemployment \ncompensation.\nCompensation was granted and received based on his certification of unemployment.\nWhen he returned to work in about February 2003, funds continued to be deposited into\nhis bank account for the weeks ending March 8, 2003, March 13, 2003, March 22,\n2003, and April 26, 2003. Applicant was initially unaware of these deposits.  Once they\n3\nwere discovered, he kept the funds because he feared he might lose his house.  \n4\nApplicant\u2019s new job paid less than his prior employer. Meanwhile, his new wife,\nwho had two children of her own, was unemployed. Providing for six family members\nwas nearly impossible and more accounts went unpaid. He filed for bankruptcy\nprotection in May 2004. A month later, he was arrested and charged with knowingly\nmaking a false statement and representation and failing to disclose a material fact to\nthe unemployment commission for the four weeks of unemployment compensation paid\nout after he returned to work. At a July 2004 hearing, Applicant advised the tribunal he\nhad filed for bankruptcy. It was his understanding that if he pled guilty, the matter would\nbe dropped.  He was sentenced to 60 days in jail, placed on probation for a year, and\n5\nordered to pay court costs. Applicant testified that garnishment was put into place to\nrepay the approximately $2,000 in overpayments noted in SOR allegation \u00b6 1n, but he\nfailed to provide evidence showing garnishment had paid off or reduced this debt. \nIn December 2004, Applicant completed an SF-86 and answered \u201cno\u201d to\nquestions as to whether he had any delinquent debts. Although he gave full answers\nregarding his bankruptcy petition and liens, he failed to indicate his delinquent debts.\nThis was due to oversight caused by his rush to complete the form and his failure to\nunderstand the question.  He similarly failed to disclose the convictions related to the\n6\nunemployment compensation overpayments and related misrepresentations. He\nbelieved the charges had been \u201cdropped.\u201d  Applicant does not completely understand\n7\neither the process of recoupment or his conviction.8\nIn 2005, Applicant reconsidered his bankruptcy filing. While he thought it would\n\u201clook better\u201d to pay off his debt himself, he also had property taxes that could be\n\n Tr. 24.\n9\n Tr. 67.\n10\n Tr. 31 regarding \u00b6 1.g for $320.\n11\n SOR \u00b6 1k states a balance of $2,513 remained as of February 5, 2008, on account ending \u2013 0473. See Ex.\n12\n3, Interrogatories, at 4. Applicant had two to four accounts with this same creditor. There is some evidence\nthat one or two entries may be duplicates. Tr. 50-56. One account was taken over by another creditor, as\nshown on Ex. A. Ex. A shows a history of regular payments not inconsistent with those prior payments shown\nin Ex. 3, with a current balance of $954. In the absence of the original February 5, 2008, credit report, and in\nlight of the ultimate disposition in this case, I find regular payments were paid on the account noted in the SOR\n(account ending \u2013 0473). \n Tr. 29-30.\n13\n Tr. 28-29, 67.\n14\n4\nincluded if he re-filed.  A consumer credit counseling service advised him to pay off\n9\nwhat he could and he moved to dismiss the bankruptcy action. He was told they could\nnot help him because he had insufficient funds to start making significant payments. He\nintends to return to counseling when he has more bills paid or under control.10\nMeanwhile, his wife left with her children the following year and they divorced in 2006.\nApplicant has struggled to keep up with child and household expenses. His lack\nof financial savvy has made the attempt more difficult. He stated, albeit without\ndocumentary proof, that he has satisfied four delinquent accounts not noted in the\nSOR. He denied the medical account noted as SOR allegation \u00b6 1g is his, arguing that,\nas former military personnel, all of his medical care is provided and paid through the\nVeteran\u2019s Administration.  There is no evidence that he has formally disputed the\n11\ninclusion of this account on his credit report with the credit reporting bureaus. He made\nsubstantial progress, however, paying down one account at issue in the SOR,  SOR\n12\nallegation \u00b6 1k. That debt was reduced from $2,513 to $954 through regular payments.\nHe admits the remaining nine accounts noted in the SOR, amounting to an additional\nsum in the approximate amount of $7,000, remain outstanding.  Consequently, that\n13\nbalance, along with the balance owed on SOR allegation \u00b6 1k, is currently around\n$8,000. This sum does not include any balance owed toward the $2,000 in workers\ncompensation debt he alleged he is currently satisfying through garnishment. \nMuch of Applicant\u2019s money over the past years has been expended on his two\nchildren. Without child support, the burden was onerous. They are both finished with\ncollege now, and he intends to devote the money formerly spent on them to his\ndelinquent debts.14\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n15\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n16\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n17\n Id.\n18\n5\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n15\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n16\n17\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n18\n\n Id.\n19\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n20\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n21\n Neither the filing for nor the voluntary dismissal of a single bankruptcy action is, by itself, sufficient to raise\n22\nsecurity concerns to the extent that both are legal and valid options for addressing debt. \n6\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n19\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n20\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline (Criminal Conduct) to\nbe the most pertinent to the case. Conditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines\nthat could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which\nwould mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGUIDELINE F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  The Regulation sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions\n21\nunder this guideline.  \nBetween 1998 and 2004, Applicant acquired a number of debts which ultimately\nbecame delinquent. They currently amount to about $8,000 to $10,000. Of the accounts\nat issue, represented in the SOR as allegations \u00b6\u00b6 AG 1(a)-1(k) and \u00b6 1(n), the\nevidence only reflects payment on the account noted at SOR allegation \u00b6 1(k).\nConsequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) apply.  With such conditions raised, the burden shifts to\n22\nAppellant to overcome the case against her and mitigate security concerns. \nIn 1997, Applicant was given custody of his two children and his ex-wife provided\nchild support. That support was curtailed by 1999, although Applicant substantially\nretained physical custody of the children. He also experienced periods of\nunemployment in 2002 and 2003. In 2005, he moved to dismiss his bankruptcy petition,\na strategy that could have helped resolve his debts. He decided to tackle his delinquent\ndebts alone, without the help and guidance of a finance professional. Lacking such\n\n7\nguidance, his delinquent debts remain largely unaddressed. Therefore, Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) cannot apply.\nWhile Applicant showed that he has substantially paid a little over a third of one\nof the debts at issue, he presented no documentary evidence demonstrating his efforts\ntoward any of the many other debts at issue. Consequently, FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d), (\u201cthe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts\u201d) cannot apply. \nApplicant did not complete financial counseling. He did not present an\nestablished plan or articulate a new approach for addressing his many remaining\ndelinquent debts. Further, there is no indication that continuing with his current method\nfor addressing his debts without professional guidance or oversight will result in any\nsignificant results in the near future. Therefore, FC MC AG \u00b6 20)(c) (\u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d) does not apply. None of the\nother mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct\nWith respect to Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), the Government has established\nits case. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00b6 1001, it is a crime to knowingly and willfully make any\nmaterially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in any matter within\nthe jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the United States.\nApplicant admits he failed to note his arrest and conviction for knowingly making false\nstatements, and failing to disclose material facts to the unemployment compensation\ncommission. Such conduct and admissions are sufficient to raise security concerns,\ninvoke Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) AG \u00b6 31(a) (\u201ca single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d), and CC DC AG \u00b631(c) (\u201callegation or admission of\ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted, or convicted\u201d), and initiate inquiry.\nApplicant failed to disclose on his SF-86 form that he had been arrested and\nconvicted over the unemployment compensation overpayments. He testified that It was\nhis understanding that if he pled guilty, the matter would be dropped. Consequently, it\nwas not at the forefront of his thoughts when he completed the SF-86. \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s testimony was highly credible. His depiction of the legal\nproceedings regarding the overpayments shows how little he understands those\nproceedings and the significance of his plea. He believes the matter was \u201cdropped.\u201d\nTherefore, it was not in his thoughts when he completed the SF-86. While this raises\nquestions regarding his judgment, such questions are better considered under the\n\u201cwhole person\u201d analysis below in light of evidence indicating his failure to note these\nincidents was neither a knowing or willing attempt to defraud or mislead.\n\n8\nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nUnder this guideline, examination is made of an Applicant\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information based on his past personal\nconduct and actions. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the\nsecurity clearance process. Applicant denied having any financial delinquencies on his\nDecember 2004 SF-86. He also denied having been convicted of any offense in the\nseven years preceding his execution of that application. Consequently, Personal\nConduct (PC) Disqualifying Condition (DC), \u00b6 16(a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment,\nor falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d) applies.\nApplicant credibly testified that he was in a hurry to complete his SF-86 and that\nhe may not have understood the questions at issue. He did, however, provide complete\ninformation about his liens and his then-pending bankruptcy petition. The information\nabout the bankruptcy was more than sufficient to give notice that he had delinquent\naccounts and money issues. Moreover, there is no evidence he deliberately omitted,\nconcealed, or falsified relevant facts regarding the fact he had delinquent debts. As for\nnot listing his convictions for the unemployment compensation, Applicant\u2019s testimony\nand demeanor make it more than plausible that he did not and does not completely\ncomprehend either the process or the plea he entered. Again, there is no indication of\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification. \nLacking a disqualifying condition, I find that Guideline E does not apply. These\nfacts and his explanations, however, do raise questions of judgment. Such questions\nare thoroughly considered under the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, below.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\n\n9\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a forthright and mature man who is devoted to his children. He has\nmade great sacrifices to raise and educate them. Lacking a background in finance and\nfailing to adhere to a coherent approach for tackling his delinquent debts, however, he\nrelied on a haphazard approach to address the debts at issue. He also put off to the\nfuture much needed financial counseling. As a result, almost all the debts at issue in the\nSOR remain unaddressed. Moreover, he failed to provide documentary evidence of\nthose efforts he testified he has made. As a consequence of these factors, Applicant\nfailed to mitigate security concerns regarding his finances. In failing to provide\ndocumentation reflecting his efforts to date, he failed to mitigate financial considerations\nsecurity concerns.  \nFurther, while the guidelines for personal conduct and criminal conduct are an ill\nfit for consideration of Applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability, those qualities are inherent\nto the analysis of the \u201cwhole person.\u201d Despite his best intentions and efforts to raise and\neducate his children without financial help from their mother, his actions and inactions\ndemonstrate questionable judgment. Substituting his own repayment scheme for his\nbankruptcy petition only served to protract repayment of his debts. Failing to complete\nfinancial counseling resulted in a haphazard approach to rectifying his financial\nsituation. Not documenting his efforts to resolve his finances undermined his burden to\nmitigate security concerns. While seeking aid from a financial expert might help reverse\nhis course, demonstrate solid judgment, and help mitigate financial considerations\nsecurity concerns, at present, genuine security concerns remain. Therefore, I conclude\nit is not clearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.

MATCHINSKI\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nFahryn Hoffman, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is legally responsible for about $15,643 in delinquent consumer credit debt largely\nincurred in or before 2003 when she and her spouse were still together. She applied in November\n2007 for consumer credit counseling assistance and has taken steps to reduce her health care costs\nthrough applying for new health insurance and for veteran\u2019s benefits. Yet financial considerations\nare not fully mitigated where she has had to rely on an overdraft account to meet her expenses, and\nis counting on help from others for the funds to make promised payments to creditors. Clearance is\ndenied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nOn her November 2005 e-QIP, Applicant listed her military rank as E-3, senior airman. (Ex. 1) The E-3 rate\n1\nis usually that of an airman first class. The senior airman rate is E-4.\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by \u00b6 E3.1.2 of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) on July 10, 2007, detailing\nthe basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (financial considerations) of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The guidelines were provided to Applicant\nwhen the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR on August 16, 2007, and elected to have\na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 2, 2007.\nI convened a hearing on November 7, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Four government exhibits\n(Ex. 1-4) were admitted into evidence and Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript received\non November 16, 2007.\nThe record was open until November 16, 2007, for Applicant to submit documents pertinent\nto her financial situation. Applicant timely submitted seven exhibits to which the government had\nno objections. The documents were marked and admitted as Exhibits A-G.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F that Applicant owes delinquent debt totaling $21,638 to\nseven creditors (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u20131.g). Applicant admitted the debts when she answered the SOR. She\naverred they were in the process of being resolved with her future ex-husband's cooperation to\nassume half of the debt since it was incurred just before and during their marriage. As for her share\nof the debt, she indicated she had dropped her health insurance to obtain a little extra money to pay\nthem and she was working with credit counselors. Yet she testified at her hearing that she dropped\nher insurance for only one month as she could not afford to do so due to ongoing medication costs\nand she was not seeking assistance in resolving her debt.\nAfter a thorough consideration of the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the\nfollowing factual findings.\nApplicant is a 34-year-old administrative assistant who is a contract employee at a federally\nfunded research and development laboratory. She has been separated from her spouse since May\n2003, and supports herself on her salary. Applicant has no dependents.\nApplicant was in the United States Air Force from September 1992 to May 2000. She was\ngranted an honorable discharge.  Applicant held a secret-level security clearance with no security\n1\nincidents while she was in the service.\nApplicant married her spouse in June 1999. He had recently been discharged from the\nmilitary and was unemployed. She bought their wedding rings for $2,300 on her credit card (SOR\n\u00b6 1.f). He told her that he would take care of the repayment. Some payments were made but a $1,933\n\n3\ndelinquent balance was eventually charged off in March 2003 with $287 past due. In June 1999, they\npurchased furniture (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and a washer and dryer (SOR \u00b6 1.c) for their new home on credit\naccounts opened only in Applicant\u2019s name.  A debt balance of $3,992 for the furniture was charged\noff and placed for collection in May 2003. A debt balance of $448 for the washer and dryer was\nreferred for collection in July 2002.\nFollowing her discharge from the service in May 2000, Applicant worked as an office\nmanager for an investment management firm until July 2002. She resigned when she became tired\nof the lengthy commute, and was unemployed until October 2002. She then worked as a sales clerk\nfor less than six months. From March 2003 to November 2004, she was employed as an\nadministrative assistant at a corporation that does defense work. She was laid off due to lack of a top\nsecret clearance. Applicant separated from her spouse in mid-May 2003, and moved to her own\napartment. \nApplicant was unemployed from November 2004 to April 2005. She collected unemployment\ncompensation of $700 every two weeks. In April 2005, she started with her present employer, a\nsubcontractor for a federally-funded research and development laboratory located on the military\ninstallation where she had been stationed previously. On November 10, 2005, Applicant executed\nan electronic questionnaire for investigations processing (e-QIP).  She responded \u201cYes\u201d to question\n28 a. [\u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d] and disclosed\nan $800 furniture debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d) owed since July 1999, a $500 credit card obligation due since\nJune 1999 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) for a washer and dryer, a $1,500 credit card debt unpaid since April 1999\n(SOR \u00b6 1.f), a retail charge debt of $1,000 incurred in June 2004 (not alleged, settled in June 2004\nafter sent for collection), and a $1,000 personal loan debt due since February 1999 (SOR \u00b6 1.a).\nApplicant explained that she had just paid off her car loan and would be working on her debt that\nshe attributed to unemployment and marital separation. Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to question 28.b\n[\u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d]. Applicant was granted an interim\nsecret-level clearance for her duties.\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit in July 2006 revealed previously undisclosed debts: telephone\ncharges of $77 in collection since September 2004; retail credit card charges of $77 due since\nDecember 2004; a charged off credit card debt of $431 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and a $1,610 past due credit\ncard balance in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.e). The furniture debt that she had listed in the amount of $800\nwas reportedly delinquent in the amount of $6,132 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). No progress was reported toward\nresolving those debts she had listed on her security clearance application with the exception of\nsettling the $1,000 retail charge debt  after it had been referred for collection. Applicant also owed\noverdraft charges of about $500 largely due to costs incurred to repair her vehicle ($300 to $500 in\nsmall expenses and $545 when the car got broken into) from May 2003 to September 2006, moving\nexpenses, and groceries.\nIn April 2007, Applicant was asked by DOHA to provide documentation showing that she\nhad satisfied or was making payments on her delinquent debt. Applicant furnished documentation\nshowing she had settled on March 17, 2006, her account with the retailer that had reported a $77 past\ndue balance on her July 2006 credit report. Applicant provided a personal financial statement\nshowing that with monthly payments of $50 on a $500 overdraft debt and $30 on a $600 MasterCard\ndebt,  she was operating at a monthly deficit of $66. Applicant had monthly prescription costs of $65\nplus an additional $40 per quarter, medical and dental insurance costs totaling $454, and yearly\n\n4\noffice visit co-pays totaling $150. She added that she owes back taxes of $2,000 for 2005 and $755\nfor 2006. Applicant submitted a recent credit report of March 9, 2007, confirming she was not\nmaking payments on her delinquent debt, which she acknowledged except for the $77 retail debt:\nSee credit report for outstanding debts. Have not been making regular payments on\nmost of the older ones because it was debt credited for the wedding and once I was\nmarried. I am not paying all of that debt alone, nor can I afford it. A settlement has\nto be arranged within the divorce as to who will pay what. The items that were debt\nunder my name and my name only that had nothing to do with my spouse or marriage\nhave been paid. (Ex. 2)\n \nA subsequent check of her credit in May 2007 showed no payments on those debts in\ncollection status. The financial history of her delinquent accounts is set forth in the following table.\nDebt as alleged in SOR\nDelinquency history\nPayment status\n\u00b6 1.a $3,970 credit card debt\nwritten off\nInstallment loan $7,500\nopened Apr 99; paid on time\nuntil Feb 01; $3,970 written\noff Nov 02.\nUnpaid, disputing with her\nspouse that she is solely\nresponsible.\n\u00b6 1.b $431 credit card debt\ncharged off\nRevolving charge opened\nMay 96; high balance $2,125;\n$448 written off with $202\npast due Dec 03, balance\n$431. Reported as past due\nMay 07.\nUnpaid.\n\u00b6 1.c $524 retail store\ninstallment account in\ncollection\n$448 for collection Jul 02;\n$661 balance Dec 06.\nSpouse took the washer and\ndryer, was supposed to pay\nher and has not. Unpaid.\n\u00b6 1.d $5,588 furniture debt in\ncollection\nInstallment account opened\nJun 1999; $3,992 credit limit\ncharged off May 03, for\ncollection, $6,132 balance\nreported May 06, but listed at\n$5,496 Feb 07 and $5,588\nMay 07\nUnpaid.\n\u00b6 1.e $1,743 credit card debt\nin collection\n$1,230 for collection Aug 02;\n$1,743 balance May 07.\nUnpaid.\n\nDebt as alleged in SOR\nDelinquency history\nPayment status\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g is very likely the furniture debt. On the March 2007 credit report, the assignee was\n2\nreportedly collecting for a bank as original creditor. The account number listed for that debt appears on the May 2007\ncredit report under the name of the same assignee, but with the original creditor listed as the furniture company. It is\nlikely that the furniture company had its financing through a bank, and the date the account with the creditor bank was\nopened is consistent with when Applicant would have been buying furniture for her new residence. She was married in\nJune 1999 and the account was opened that same month. \n5\n\u00b6 1.f $3,250 credit card debt\nin collection\nRevolving charge opened\nMay 99 for their wedding\nrings; original balance\n$2,300; $1,933 charged off\nMar 03 with $287 past due;\n$3,250 balance in collection \nDec 06.\nSpouse promised to repay her\nbut has not. Still outstanding.\n\u00b6 1.g $6,132 in collection\nSee \u00b6 1.d same debt\nUnpaid.\n2\nAfter she received the SOR, Applicant contacted her spouse by email on August 6, 2007, and\ndemanded that they discuss their marital debt. Applicant\u2019s spouse responded that he would pay\n$3,753 (half of the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f minus $500 for tires on her car and $700\nfor her cell phone) plus half of the actual furniture debt. He believed the furniture debt was about\n$3,000 total rather than the $5,588 reported as delinquent. Applicant\u2019s spouse denied any obligation\nfor the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g as he believed it was a consolidation of Applicant\u2019s debts incurred before\nthey met. Applicant responded to him that she did not recall having to consolidate before their\nmarriage, but she would have to take his word for it. He indicated that she should attempt to settle\nwith her creditors for lesser amounts, and resolve the smaller debts first. She replied she did not have\nany extra money and asked for his assistance in keeping her accountable (\u201cI\u2019m not accountable to\nanyone but myself and that makes it difficult for me to get anything done.\u201d).\nOn August 9, 2007, Applicant contacted a for-fee debt counseling company via the Internet\nconcerning the process of resolving her debt. On August 10, 2007, Applicant informed her spouse\nthat she wanted to discuss resolution of the debt via a debt counselor. He told her that he was\nworking on getting her the money to pay his share of the debt and that she should focus on\ndetermining the extent of the debt. Applicant submitted an online application for credit counseling\nthrough a debt counseling organization. Applicant did not pursue any debt counseling or repayment\nthrough a debt management plan at that time due to her spouse\u2019s lack of cooperation.\nFor about a month from mid-August 2007, Applicant dropped her health insurance to give\nher extra funds, and she stopped taking medications for her depression after ten years. She resumed\nhealth insurance coverage as she realized she needed her medications.\n\nApplicant testified that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a was a credit card that she used before her marriage when her\n3\nspouse was in the process of obtaining his discharge from active duty military service (Tr. 29, 37). The March 2007\ncredit report indicates the debt in \u00b6 1.a was an installment account with 60 months terms. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b was a\nrevolving charge account.\nRecent earnings statements reflect net pay at $833.07 biweekly after deducting $42 for dental insurance and\n4\n$467.89 for medical insurance. Her net pay without deductions for medical costs was $1,277.18, so her monthly net is\nabout $2,110.25. (Ex. D) \n6\nAs of her November 7, 2007, hearing, Applicant and her spouse had not come to any\nagreement on resolving the debts incurred during their marriage.  Applicant and her spouse plan to\n3\ndivorce but have not done so as they cannot afford the costs of filing. Applicant has been unable to\ncontact her spouse by cell phone. She does not have the funds to pay her old debts and lives from\npaycheck to paycheck.  Applicant is afraid to contact her creditors directly (\u201cI feel very overwhelmed\n4\nright now and there is really not much I can say to them. I feel like right now I\u2019m doing what I can,\nliving paycheck to paycheck, and I feel very strapped right now.\u201d Tr. 41-42). She estimates that her\nmonthly expenses, which include health and dental insurance costs of $509.89 and cell phone costs\nof $100, exceed her monthly income by about $300. Applicant is scheduled to begin repaying her\nincome tax debt at $100 per month starting in late November 2007. The 2005 tax debt was because\nshe had no taxes withheld from her unemployment compensation. She had no prior experience with\nunemployment compensation and did not realize that taxes had to be paid on that income. The 2006\ntax debt is attributed to her employer\u2019s failure to timely honor her request to reduce her exemption\nto zero and to then withhold an additional $20 per pay period. Available earnings statements show\nthat she was claiming zero exemptions and having the additional $20 withheld for taxes as of\nSeptember 10, 2007, if not before.\nAs of November 2007, Applicant had taken steps to reduce her medical insurance costs by\nabout $250 a month through applying for new health insurance. On November 15, 2007, Applicant\nenrolled online in a nonprofit debt management program. On November 16, 2007, Applicant applied\nfor health benefits from  the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nApplicant does not have any active credit card accounts. As of April 2007, she owed $735\non a credit card account with a $750 limit that she had opened in December 2006. She made $30\nmonthly payments on the card until June when she closed the account and arranged to pay $50 per\nmonth toward the balance, which was about $900 as of her hearing. Applicant estimated her\nchecking account balance at $14. Applicant was making her rent and car payments on time. She was\nplanning to accept the offers of others for financial assistance in order to be able to make the monthly\n$100 income tax and $50 credit card payments she agreed to. Collection agencies were not\naggressively pursuing collection of the old debts as of November 2007.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\n\n7\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F\u2014Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18) Applicant and her spouse overspent at the beginning of\ntheir marriage. With her spouse just out of the service and without a job, Applicant charged the\n$2,300 cost of their wedding rings to her revolving charge account in May 1999. The following\nmonth, they bought over $3,000 worth of furniture on her credit. They handled the credit extended\nto her irresponsibly, and several accounts became delinquent while they were still together (SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f). A credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.b) was written off after Applicant and her\nspouse had separated. Applicant is legally responsible for the debt, even if her spouse also enjoyed\nthe goods and services extended to them in her name only. As of her hearing in November 2007, the\ndebts were unresolved. Disqualifying conditions \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts),\nand \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply.\nApplicant\u2019s ability to repay the delinquent debt was compromised by her marital separation\nin May 2003 and her unemployment from November 2004 to April 2005. Her unemployment\ncompensation of about $1,400 a month was not sufficient to pay her living expenses, and Applicant\nrelied on overdraft protections to pay for necessities such as groceries and gasoline, as well as repairs\nto her vehicle. Her employer\u2019s failure to adjust her exemptions and tax withholding amounts was a\nfactor outside of her control that left her more heavily in debt. She also had significant out-of-pocket\nmedical costs related to treatment for depression, including the cost of insurance. These are the type\nof factors contemplated within mitigating condition \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances), but her history of spending beyond her means is not\nmitigated by \u00b6 20(b).\n\nThe allegation does not represent additional indebtedness, but is resolved against Applicant because she had\n5\nnot taken any action toward satisfying the debt in \u00b6 1.d which is likely the same debt.\n8\nApplicant remains under significant financial pressure. She reports a negative cash flow after\npayment of monthly expenses, and has only about $14 in her checking account. Although the\nDirective does not require that an applicant be debt free, Applicant presents a mixed record with\nregard to her recent handling of her financial situation. She opened a new credit card account in\nDecember 2006 with a credit limit of $750. As of November 2007, she owed about $900 on the\naccount. While she showed good judgment in cancelling the card, and arranging to repay the debt\nat $50 monthly, the fact that the debt balance exceeds her credit limit bears troubling implications\nfor her ability to live within her means. She is paying about $100 per month for a cellular phone\nwhich seems excessive given her limited resources. Applicant has admitted that she feels\noverwhelmed by her financial situation. Her recent applications for consumer credit counseling\nassistance and for more affordable health insurance warrant consideration of MC \u00b6 20(d) (the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts), but it\nis too soon to safely conclude that her financial problems are likely to be resolved in the near future.\nEven if she is successful in reducing her monthly health insurance costs by $250, she would still\nneed to rely on financial help from friends and/or family that has yet to materialize.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant\nheld a clearance while she was in military and abided by the rules and regulations concerning the\nsafeguarding of classified information. She is also credited for being candid about her delinquencies,\nbut indicated in November 2005 that she would be working on her delinquent debts. She settled two\ndelinquent consumer credit debts owed to retailers, but had not made any payments on the accounts\nalleged in the SOR as of November 2007. Her recent efforts to resolve her debts are preliminary and\nnot enough to overcome the concerns for her financial judgment.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

Howry, Esq. , Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant, a 14 year employee of a major defense contractor with 26 year of Navy service,\nmitigated security concerns relating to delinquent debts by showing that three delinquent debts which\nraised security concernsare being resolved through regular payment to the creditors, including the\nIRS for delinquent taxes. Applicant\u2019s career history and credible testimony justified application of\nmitigating conditions and whole person analysis. Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn November 9, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be\nreferred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nOn November 29, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to another judge on December 18, 2006, and re-assigned to me on January\n5, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on January 24, 2007, for a hearing on February 28, 2007, and\nheld that day. The government offered in evidence four exhibits and Applicant offered ten. All were\nadmitted. Applicant and his wife testified. The transcript was received on March 12, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted two of the five SOR allegations but denied the other three financial\nallegations with explanatory information for all. After a complete review of the record, I make the\nfollowing additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor where he has been employed as\na technical support specialist for naval exercises during the past 14 years. He has held a security\nclearance for 40 years since 1966. He served on active duty with the Navy for 26 years and retired\nas a senior chief petty officer. He has been married for 40 years and has three grown children.\nThe following is an analysis of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR referenced by their\nnumber and their current status:\n1.a.: IRS lien filed in 2001 for $123,425 related to tax deficiencies for 1994-1997 and 1999.\nApplicant was aware of the deficiencies on taxes and that some payments had been made for\nseveral years from tax refunds owed to him. He did not receive the notice of the lien and was\nunaware of it until 2004 when it showed up during the investigation for his clearance. His\nwife who usually handled the bills was to work with IRS to resolve it but did not do so. He\n\n3\nestablished an installment agreement in July 2006 (Exh. A). Payments of $500 per month\nhave been and are being made through checks (Exh. K) and payroll deductions to resolve the\ndeficiency.\n1.b: Credit card debt of $4,067 settled for $2,500 (Exh. B) and payments have been made of\n$375 for four months. Applicant has decided to pay the full amount owed and not the\nsettlement figure in an effort to establish better credit rating. He has agreed with creditor to\ndo so. He will pay $300 per month until total amount is paid. \n1.c.: Applicant questioned credit card debt of $1,997 on credit report and determined debt\nwas not his (Exh. C). Government withdrew allegation at the hearing (Tr.  80-81). \n1.d.: Student loan debt of $6,470 was incurred in 1992 and 1993. The debt was half of the\nstudent loan of Applicant\u2019s son which both agreed to pay. The debt was deferred while\nApplicant himself attended college and graduated in 2002. It was deferred further until\nSeptember, 2006 (Exh. D). Payments of $135 per month are being made through payroll\ndeductions from Applicant\u2019s salary. \n1.e.:Credit card debt of $6,353 has been paid in full for some time (Exh. E). Government\nwith drew allegation at the hearing (Tr.80-81).\nApplicant was a late arrival for college education. He did not attend college until he was in\nhis 50's graduating in 2002 with a business degree. It was during school period that the family debts\ngrew since he was working full time while he attended school and paying tuition. He did not have\na student loan. During this same period his wife\u2019s employment and income ceased. \nApplicant\u2019s monthly income is now $2,400 (Exh. J) since he received a promotion in\nSeptember 2006 that will provide an additional $200 per month (Exhs. I and J). He receives $1,000\nper month from military retirement and $218 per month from Veterans Administration for a partial\ndisability. His wife is not employed except for daycare provided for her grandchildren for which she\nreceives $500 per month. He has a 401K valued at $50,000.\nApplicant is well regarded by his company for his work as a deserving employee and quality\nperformer (Exhs I and J).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\n\n4\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence,\nthat conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may\ndisqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information See Egan, 484 U.S.\nat 531. \nThe applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national\nsecurity.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the\nside of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts prompted the allegation of security concerns under Guideline\nF since an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. (AG \u00b6 18) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude a history of not meeting financial obligations (AG \u00b6 19 c), and evidence of inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts (AG \u00b6 19 a ). \nMitigating Conditions (MC) might include the fact that the person has initiated a good faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts (AG \u00b6 20 d). In view of the fact that the\ngovernment withdrew two of the five delinquent debt allegations and two of the remaining are being\npaid, the most serious concerns the IRS deficiency that resulted in the filing of a tax lien. That debt\nis also being resolved although Applicant candidly admits he failed to resolve it in a timely manner\nthinking that his wife was handling the matter. When he realized that she was not taking care of it,\nhe did so. They had a reasonable belief that it was being resolved through the overpayments from\nother tax years. They presented credible testimony that they were unaware of the lien probably\noccasioned by moving their residence about the time it would have been served on them. \nMitigating conditions apply since the problems have now been resolved to the satisfaction\nof all the creditors, and he is resolving the one debt that remain through a payment program now in\neffect. An applicant is not required to prove that all delinquent debts are resolved to be granted a\nsecurity clearance, but only that efforts be made to resolve the debts and to show that the matters are\nbeing diligently pursued with an ability to resolve them. The documentation submitted by Applicant\nestablish his good faith efforts to resolve the debts. \nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts\nand omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant\ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant\n\n5\nestablished that he is a hard-working professional. His debts accumulated, but he has taken steps to\nresolve all of them satisfactorily and has the financial means to remain out of debt.\nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Applicant\nhas held a security clearance for 40 years with no security violations. He holds a responsible position\nand is a respected employee of his company. He has been married for 40 years, raised and educated\nthree children and obtained a college degree later in life. His career in the Navy while holding a\nsecurity clearance was unblemished. The three remaining debts alleged in the SOR are now resolved\nor in the process of resolution. The amounts remaining are not extensive compared to his annual\nincome and his assets. Also, they are not so great as to create any significant potential for pressure\nthat would give rise to security concerns.\nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, I conclude that a security clearance should\nbe granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nWithdrawn\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nWithdrawn\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or renew a security clearance for Applicant.

She and her husband were born\n\nItem 2 (Applicant\u2019s letter response to SOR dated Oct. 23, 2006).\n1\nThe government submitted six items in support of the allegations, and ten source documents in support of\n2\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s proposed material facts concerning India.\n2\nin India and became U.S. citizens in 2003.

Applicant submitted no mitigating\nevidence for consideration, and did not meet her burden to overcome foreign influence security\nconcerns raised by her close family ties. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant applied for a security clearance on August 2, 2005, in conjunction with her\nemployment by a defense contractor as a software engineer. On September 29, 2006, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended. The\nSOR detailed reasons, under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative\njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a notarized letter dated October 23, 2006,\nadmitting the truth of all of the allegations, and elected to have her case decided on the written record\nin lieu of a hearing.  Applicant did not submit any matters for consideration in extenuation or\n1\nmitigation of her admissions. Department Counsel submitted the government's written case on\nMarch 28, 2007. \nA complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and\n2\nshe was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation. Applicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of her copy of the FORM on April\n10, 2007, and returned it to DOHA. She responded further to the FORM in a letter, dated April 17,\n2007, in which she provided further information concerning her financial support for her parents,\nthe property she owns in India and her reasons for traveling there. She also pointed out that she has\ntwo children, not formerly mentioned, who are U.S. citizens by birth. She made no objection to\nconsideration of any evidence submitted by Department Counsel who, in turn, did not object to the\nadmissibility in evidence of Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM. \nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on June 1, 2007. That judge recused\nherself due to a potential conflict. The case was then assigned to me, also on June 1, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT             \n\nItem 3 (e-QIP security clearance questionnaire, dated Aug. 2, 2005) at 7, 12-13, 30.

Those admissions are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After complete and thorough review of the evidence in the\nrecord, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a security\nclearance for the first time.  She was born and raised in India. The record does not indicate when,\n3\nor under what circumstances, she moved to the United States. Her husband was also born in India,\nand they were married there in September 1995.   She attended graduate school in the U.S. from\n4\n1997 to 2000, when she was awarded a master\u2019s degree in computer science.  She has worked in the\n5\nU.S. from 1997 to present.   She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2003.  Her husband\n6\n7\nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in June 2003.  Applicant had an Indian passport from March 1995\n8\nuntil it expired in March 2005, but could not use it after becoming a U.S. citizen because India does\nnot recognize dual citizenship.  She was issued a U.S. passport in October 2004.\n9\n10\nApplicant reported on her security questionnaire, and admitted in response to the SOR, that\nher father, mother, two sisters and father-in-law are citizens of, and reside in India.  Although not\n11\nalleged in the SOR due to an apparent error, she also listed her husband\u2019s brother, who is an Indian\ncitizen residing in a different U.S. state and working as an assistant professor, on her clearance\napplication.  She did not list, nor otherwise earlier disclose that she has two other brothers-in-law\n12\nwho are citizens and residents of India, but admitted that fact in response to the allegation in SOR\n\u00b6 1.d that improperly described her husband\u2019s brother\u2019s status. The other two brothers-in-law are\npresumably her sisters\u2019 husbands. Neither Applicant nor any of her relatives have ever worked for,\n\nItem 4 at 3, 4; Item 5 at 2.\n13\nItem 4 at 4; Applicant\u2019s Response (AR) to FORM, dated Apr.17, 2007, at 1.\n14\nItem 4 at 5; Item 5 at 1; AR to FORM at 2. \n15\nItem 4 at 5.\n16\nItem 2, supra n. 1, at 1.\n17\nItem 4 at 4.\n18\nAlthough not listed on Item 3, she reported having these children in AR to FORM, supra n. 14, at 2.\n19\nItems 7-16.\n20\n4\nor had any connection with, the Indian government, military, police, intelligence or security\nservices.13\nApplicant provides financial support to her parents in the amount of $1,000 every two\nmonths. Her father had a stroke in September 2006, and was a business consultant with no pension\nor retirement income. Her mother never worked outside the family home. She has an account, with\na minimal balance, in an Indian bank for use in transferring these funds to her parents.  Her father\n14\nbought a small piece of land, worth a few thousand dollars, and gave it to Applicant as a gift. She\nintends to let it appreciate, then sell it and use the proceeds to support her parents.  She has almost\n15\n$500,000 in total assets in the United States and a net worth of over $250,000.  Applicant traveled\n16\nto India to visit her family in April 1997, April 2000, February 2002, December 2002, and December\n2005.  She has close relationships with her family members.  She and her husband have two U.S.\n17\n18\nborn children, ages 5 and 4.19\nIndia is an ally of the United States. It is the world\u2019s largest democratic republic and is\nexperiencing major and rapid economic expansion. India has been identified as an active collector\nof sensitive and proprietary industrial information. Anti-western and domestic terrorist activity in\nIndia is a continuing threat.  \n20\nPOLICIES            \nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in\nthe evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline,\nthe adjudicative guidelines are divided into disqualifying conditions (DC) that may raise security\nconcerns, and mitigating conditions (MC) that may reduce or negate security concerns. Applicable\nDCs and MCs must be considered in deciding whether to grant, continue, deny or revoke an\nindividual's eligibility for access to classified information.\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible, ironclad\nrules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are\nintended to be applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision\n\nDirective, Enclosure 2, Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\n21\nInformation (December 29, 2005) \u00b6 2.\nId., at \u00b6\u00b6 2(b), 2(c).\n22\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support\n23\na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n24\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n25\n5\nof the Directive,  to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial, common sense\n21\ndecisions.\nThe entire decision-making process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \"whole person concept.\" All available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. The\nAdjudicative Process factors which an administrative judge should consider, in addition to the\napplicable guidelines, are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nProtection of the national security is the paramount consideration, so the final decision in\neach case must be arrived at by applying the standard that issuance of a clearance must be clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security. Any doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor of the national\nsecurity.   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\n22\nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\n23\nburden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which\ndemonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. \u201cDepartment Counsel is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that\nhave been controverted.\u201d   \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence\n24\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel, and [Applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance\ndecision.\u201d  Once it has met its initial burden of production, the burden of persuasion (including any\n25\n\nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

July 6, 2006). \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 6.\n27\n6\nburden to disprove a mitigating condition) never shifts to the government.  \n26\nA person who seeks access to classified information seeks to enter a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal\nduty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship\nthat the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals\nto whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that any adverse industrial\nsecurity clearance decision shall be \"in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\" Nothing in this decision should be\nconstrued to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndecision as to Applicant's loyalty or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS          \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following\nwith respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)            \n\u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person,\ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure\nor coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this guideline can and should consider the\nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including,\nbut not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d27\nAll of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members, except her husband and children, are citizens\nof and reside in India. Her mother and father are dependent on her for income, and she travels to\nIndia frequently to visit family there. These circumstances raise security concerns under foreign\ninfluence disqualifying condition (FI DC) 7(a) (\u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or\ncoercion\u201d). India is active in the collection of protected information, including from U.S. citizens,\n\nISCR Case No. 05-03250 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-02511 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20,\n28\n2007); ISCR Case No. 04-11369 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 16, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-11414 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 5, 2007).\n7\nand there is heightened risk of both anti-Indian and anti-American  terrorism by groups active within\nits borders. \nFI DC 7(b) (\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government or country that create a\npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group or country by providing this\ninformation\u201d) also applies to Applicant\u2019s Indian connections. There need not be evidence of an\nactual conflict of interest to raise security concerns. The potential conflict, arising from Applicant\u2019s\nnumerous and close ties to Indian citizens and residents, is sufficient to shift the burden to her to\ndisprove its existence, or otherwise mitigate the concerns. \nIn addition, Applicant\u2019s father-in-law and her husband\u2019s brother are Indian citizens, residing\nin India and the U.S., respectively. This raises security concerns under FI DC 7(d) (\u201csharing living\nquarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a\nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion\u201d), because her husband\u2019s\nfather and brother are subject to the same heightened risk arising under FI DC 7(a). \nHer land and bank account balance in India are of very minimal value, so FI DC 7(e) (\u201ca\nsubstantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or\nforeign-operated business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence\nor exploitation\u201d) does not apply. Neither the land nor the bank account raise any security concerns,\nexcept as they reflect the close nature of her relationship with her parents.\nApplicant has neither asserted that any foreign influence mitigating condition (FI MC)\napplies to her circumstances, nor is there any evidence in the record that would support the\napplication of any FI MC.  I have reviewed each potential FI MC and conclude that none apply. \nWhole Person Analysis           \nApplicant has close relationships with her parents, her sisters\u2019 and her husband\u2019s families,\nall of whom are citizens and residents of India. She and her husband have lived and worked in the\nUnited States for more than ten years, and both renounced their Indian citizenship upon becoming\nnaturalized U.S. citizens in 2003. Her two children are U.S. citizens by birth. All of her financial\nassets, except those she is giving to her parents, are located in the United States. None of her family\nmembers work for, or have any connection to the Indian government. She frequently visits her family\nin India. In balancing her personal attachments, the nature and extent of her U.S. and Indian family\nand social ties, her length of U.S. residence, the nature and intelligence gathering history of the\nIndian government and non-governmental groups operating there, I conclude that ongoing security\nconcerns are established on this record.28\nApplicant submitted neither evidence nor other information from which any mitigating\ncondition or circumstance might be applied to lessen the security concerns raised by the potential\nfor conflict of interest, coercion, pressure or manipulation created by her many and strong foreign\nfamily connections. Applicant is a mature and educated individual who is accountable for her\nchoices, and who did not alleviate security concerns in the face of her burden to do so. Given India\u2019s\n\n8\nreportedly active collection of protected information and heightened risk of anti-western and\ndomestic terrorist activity within its borders, this burden is a heavy one and Applicant failed to meet\nit. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant has not demonstrated that it is clearly consistent with\nthe interests of national security to grant her access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS           \nFormal Findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION            \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

He failed\nto timely file federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2002, 2003, and 2004. Applicant was\nalso disciplined by his employer in 2004 for viewing inappropriate material on his work computer.\nHe is repaying child support arrearage, but security concerns persist because of his failure to pay his\nmortgage on time, his concealment from his spouse of the details concerning his misuse of the work\ncomputer, and his failure to rectify his tax situation. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on March 8, 2007,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline H (Criminal Conduct) of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005,  and implemented by the Department\nof Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when\nthe SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR on March 28, 2007, and elected to have a decision\non the written record without a hearing.\nThe government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on April 10, 2007,\nconsisting of 12 exhibits (Items 1-12). DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and\ninstructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt. No response was received by the May 17, 2007\ndue date, and on June 14, 2007, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it was clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under guidelines F (\u00b6 1.a) and J (\u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b) that Applicant failed to timely\nfile and pay his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2002, 2003, and 2004. It was also\nalleged under Guideline F that Applicant owed a $1,247 debt as of January 2007 (\u00b6 1.b) and child\nsupport arrearage of $9,000 as of March 2005 (\u00b6 1.c), and was late in his monthly mortgage payment\nsix times in 2005 and seven times in 2006 (\u00b6 1.d). Under Guideline E, Applicant was alleged to have\nbeen disciplined by his employer in 2004 for viewing inappropriate (non pornographic) material on\nhis work computer and to have concealed the facts that led to his suspension from his spouse\nknowing it could subject him to blackmail (\u00b6 2.a).\nApplicant admitted he had difficulties satisfying some of his financial obligations because\nof a job layoff in 2002, and decreased income when he found work. As for the specific debts, he\nexpressed his belief that the debt in \u00b6 1.b had been paid, and he was repaying his child support\narrearage at $225 per month (\u00b6 1.c). He acknowledged he got behind in his mortgage due to\nunexpected expenses (vehicles breaking down, home repairs, the care of his elderly father-in-law).\nHe did not anticipate continued problems paying his mortgage on time (\u00b6 1.d), because he had paid\noff his vehicle, freeing up $450 per month, and his father-in-law had returned to his own home.\n\n3\nApplicant admitted he had used poor judgment in not following his employer\u2019s policy regarding\ncomputer usage, but while he had withheld certain information from his spouse about the\ndisciplinary action, he denied he was subject to blackmail (\u00b6 2.a). Applicant indicated that he and\nhis spouse \u201cdesperately want to rectify this situation, file our tax returns, and if any outstanding taxes\nare owed, work out a plan to meet our obligations\u201d (\u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b).\nAfter a thorough review and consideration of the FORM, including Applicant\u2019s response to\nthe SOR, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 40-year-old customer training specialist who has worked for his current\nemployer since June 1997 except for a brief layoff from early 2002 to approximately summer 2003.\nApplicant served on active duty in the United States Marines from 1985 to 1997 and was\ndischarged at the rank of staff sergeant (rate E-6). In July 1998, Applicant and his first wife divorced\nafter 11 years of marriage. Applicant and his spouse \u201ceach had custody of one of the boys.\u201d\nApplicant was ordered to pay child support, which was $450 monthly as of March 2007.\nApplicant subsequently remarried, although the date of his marriage to his second wife is not\nin the record available for review. In early 2002, Applicant was laid off from his job with his\nemployer. He chose not to relocate because of the advanced age and ill health of his in-laws, and did\nnot file for unemployment compensation. He found a job where he was paid \u201cmuch less,\u201d but the\nrecord is silent as to the extent of the income loss. Applicant notified his former spouse that he could\nnot pay his child support at the same rate and he would ask the court to modify his support\nobligation. According to Applicant and not rebutted by the government, his ex-wife told him that\nthey would work it out, and Applicant paid little, if any, child support to his ex-wife.\nIn  2002 Applicant\u2019s spouse worked part-time for a company that went out of business at the\nend of the year. When she did not receive a W-2 form for tax year 2002 by the deadline for filing\ntheir federal and state income tax returns, Applicant and his spouse filed for an extension of time to\nsubmit their returns. As of March 2007, they had not filed their federal or state income tax returns\nfor tax years 2002, 2003, or 2004. The record is silent as to whether they had filed for tax year 2005.\nIn or before summer 2003, Applicant returned to work for the defense contractor. Over the\nnext year, he viewed various Internet sites \u201con a near daily basis\u201d from his work computer, usually\nduring his lunch time but occasionally during working hours. On one website, he viewed non\npornographic images of women in swimsuits. On October 12, 2004, Applicant was placed on\ndisciplinary leave for five days, and issued a corrective action memo for viewing inappropriate (non\npornographic) material on his work computer in violation of company policy. He told his spouse that\nhis suspension was for viewing the Internet too frequently at work as he did not want her to know\nthat he had been viewing images of other women.\nAfter he started back to work with the defense contractor, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife petitioned the\ncourt to collect what Applicant owed in child support. He was ordered to pay an arrearage of about\n$9,000 at $225 monthly in addition to his monthly child support payment. Applicant arranged to\nmake the payments through payroll deduction.\n \n\nThe evidence substantiates an outstanding balance of $247 rather than the $1,247 alleged. The high credit of\n1\nthe loan was $1,247 according to Applicant\u2019s credit report (Item 7).\n4\nIn or about October 2003, Applicant\u2019s loan account with a finance company was charged off\nwith a past due balance of $247 (\u00b6 1.b). As of January 2005, Applicant was more than 120 days\ndelinquent in his $1,143 monthly mortgage obligation.\nOn March 9, 2005, Applicant was interviewed by a Defense Security Service (DSS) special\nagent about his one-week suspension from work and his financial problems. Applicant\nacknowledged he had accessed sports information and images of women clad in swimsuits on the\nInternet using his work computer, sometimes during work hours, and that he had been suspended for\nfive days. Applicant indicated he had told his spouse that his suspension was for viewing the Internet\ntoo much and he had not told her about the content accessed. He wanted to keep from her that he had\nviewed images of other women on the Internet because of the stress in their relationship (\u201cI am going\nto keep this a secret from her and accept that fact that this secret could be used against me for\nblackmail purposes.\u201d Item 6). Concerning his finances, Applicant admitted that he was being\nthreatened with foreclosure for failing to make his mortgage payments for the past three months (\u00b6\n1.d) because of other financial demands (vehicle repair and other bills). He added that he had $8,700\navailable to avoid foreclosure. He also admitted that he had a personal loan on which he had made\nno payments for the past year (\u00b6 1.b). Applicant averred he would pay the $800 balance in a few\nmonths. Applicant also acknowledged he and his spouse had not filed their 2002 or 2003 federal or\nstate tax returns (\u201cits been difficult to find all the receipts and paperwork that goes along with my\nwife\u2019s occupation, and we seem to keep putting it off\u201d), although he believed he did not owe any\ntaxes. He expressed his belief their delinquent returns would be filed within the next few months.\nUnder threat of foreclosure, Applicant brought his mortgage current as of April 2005. He had\na spotty record of timely payment thereafter, falling behind more than 30 days several times and\ntwice more than 60 days. Applicant attributes his late payments, in part, to expenses incurring in\ncaring for his elderly father-in-law, who had heart valve surgery and a leg amputation. He presented\nno evidence of the amounts spent caring for his father-in-law.\nAs of November 2006, Applicant was more than 60 days late in his mortgage. A check of\nApplicant\u2019s credit on January 16, 2007, disclosed Applicant still owed a charged-off balance of $247\non the debt in \u00b6 1.b.  He had been late more than 30 days six times in the past two years on his\n1\nautomobile loan, but had brought it current as of November 2006. The loan, opened in November\n2001 for $23,303 with monthly payments of $461, had a remaining balance of $1,467 as of\nDecember 2006. There is no evidence that Applicant owes any delinquent federal or state income\ntaxes for those tax years for which he has yet to file his returns (2002, 2003, and 2004).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\n\n5\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F\u2014Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18). As of March 2007, Applicant had not filed his\nfederal or state income tax returns for tax years 2002, 2003, and 2004. Failure to file annual federal,\nstate, or local income tax returns as required can have financial implications (\u00b6 19(g) failure to file\nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required, or the fraudulent filing of the same).\nHowever, there is no evidence that Applicant owes any delinquent federal or state income taxes, or\nthat his non filing was due to financial difficulties. Applicant told a DSS agent in March 2005 that\nhe believed he owed no taxes, and there is no evidence to the contrary. However, Guideline F\nconcerns are established because of his failure to make timely payments on a personal loan (\u00b6 1.b),\non his child support obligation (\u00b6 1.c), and on his real estate mortgage (\u00b6 1.d). Disqualifying\nconditions (DC) \u00b6 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and \u00b6 19(c) a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations, apply.\nApplicant stopped paying his child support and personal loan after he was laid off from his\njob with the defense contractor in early 2002. The Directive provides for mitigation where debts are\nincurred due to unforeseen circumstances (See mitigating condition (MC) \u00b6 20(b), the condition that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances), but Applicant must have acted reasonably.\nConcerning the child support arrearage (\u00b6 1.c), Applicant arranged for an automatic deduction of\n$225 per month from his pay toward the arrearage. While repayment pursuant to a court order does\nnot merit the same weight in reform as had he initiated a good faith effort on his own after he\nreturned to work for the defense contractor, that debt is being addressed (\u00b6 20(c) the person has\nreceived counseling and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol).\n\n6\nHowever, as for the personal loan debt, Applicant knew as of March 2005 that he had not\npaid on the account for over a year. His January 2007 credit report shows a relatively low balance\nof $247 (instead of the $1,247 alleged). He has yet to produce documentation showing that the debt\nhas been satisfied. As for his home mortgage, he has been late several times in the past two years.\nHe was more than 120 days late in payment of his mortgage in March 2005, notwithstanding his\nreturn to work for the defense contractor sometime in 2003. While he came up with about $8,700\nto bring the mortgage current, he had a spotty record of repayment thereafter. Absent documentation\nconfirming expenditures for car repair or for the care of his father-in-law, I am unable to apply MC\n\u00b6 20(b) to his mortgage delinquency.\n Applicant submits that he is in a better financial situation now, since he had paid off his car\nloan and his father-in-law had returned to his own home. A review of his recent credit report shows\na balance on his car loan of $1,467 as of December 2006. He was close to paying the debt off, and\nthere is no evidence of any recent misuse of consumer credit cards. Yet, it is too soon to conclude\nthat his financial problems are safely behind him, given his recent mortgage delinquency, and the\nabsence of any evidence showing his income is adequate to cover his expenses.\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15). Applicant exhibited extremely poor\njudgment from summer 2003 to about September 2004 when he accessed inappropriate material on\nthe Internet at work, including during work hours on occasion. Applicant\u2019s repeated violation of his\nemployer\u2019s policy concerning Internet use on his work computer is potentially disqualifying under\nDC \u00b6 16(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and\nmay not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all\navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations,\nor other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected\ninformation. This includes but is not limited to consideration of: (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule\nviolations; (4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s time or resources.\nFurthermore, since Applicant intentionally concealed from his spouse that he was suspended for\nviewing images of women in swimsuits on his work computer, DC \u00b6 16(e) personal conduct, or\nconcealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s\npersonal, professional, or community standing, applies.\nApplicant has acknowledged the inappropriate nature of his conduct and his poor judgment\n(\u201cI have absolutely learned from my experience and ensure that I make intelligent decisions based\non proper ethics, policies, procedures, and rules and regulations). Although there is no indication that\nApplicant has undergone any counseling (see \u00b6 17(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior\nand obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur), there is no evidence of recurrence, and Applicant\n\nTitle 26, Section 7203 of the United States Code provides in relevant part:\n2\nAny person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title or by\nregulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any\ninformation, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such return, keep such records,\nor supply such information, at the time or times required by law or regulation, shall, in addition to\nother penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be\nfined not more than $25,000 ($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 1\nyear, or both, together with the costs of prosecution. (Item 11)\nUnder Section 143.011 of the Missouri Revised Statutes, a tax is imposed for every taxable year on the\n3\nMissouri taxable income of every resident.  The willful failure to file is punishable as a crime under Section 143.931,\nwhich provides:\nAny person required under sections 143.011 to 143.996 to pay any tax, or required by sections\n143.011 to 143.996 to make a return (other than a return of estimated tax), keep any records, or supply\nany information, who willfully with intent to defraud fails to pay such tax, make such return, keep such\nrecords, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law, shall, in\naddition to other penalties provided by law, and upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than ten\n7\nis not likely to jeopardize his job by misusing his company computer. However, Applicant has not\nmitigated the risk of vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress where he has not been\nforthcoming with his spouse about the nature of his inappropriate Internet use. Although he indicates\nthat if an incident were to arise he would fully disclose all information to his spouse, there is little\nassurance that he will do so given his concealment to date.\nGuideline J\u2014Criminal Conduct\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nBy its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations. (AG \u00b6 30). Applicant and his spouse did not file their income tax returns, federal\nor state, starting with tax year 2002 when she failed to get her W-2 from an employer. Although they\nfiled for an extension of time to file that return, they did not file for that year or subsequent tax years\nthrough 2004, if not 2005. Although Applicant was laid off in early 2002, he did not dispute that he\nhad earned income that year. By summer 2003, he had rejoined the defense contractor. Applicant\nnow claims to not have known whether he should have filed without the W-2, and to have been\ninformed in 2003 that he could not file his income tax return without the previous year. Yet, when\nasked by the DSS agent in March 2005 about the non filing, Applicant did not claim the loss of a W-\n2 or not knowing he had to file. Instead, he responded:\nMy wife is an independent contractor and thus her taxes are somewhat difficult for\nuse to file. We have not filed our 2002 or 2003 federal or state tax returns. We do not\nbelieve we owe either the federal or state government money, but its been difficult\nto find all the receipts and paperwork that goes along with my wife\u2019s occupation, and\nwe seem to keep putting it off.\nHe knew he had an obligation to file and had not complied by March 2007. By willfully not filing\nhis federal income tax returns for tax years 2002, 2003, and 2004, Applicant committed\nmisdemeanor criminal conduct.  Under pertinent state law, his failure to file his state income tax\n2\nreturns for those years is also punishable as a crime if he had the intent to defraud.  I am not\n3\n\nthousand dollars, or be imprisoned in the county jail for not more than one year or by not less than two\nnor more than five years in the state penitentiary or by both fine and imprisonment together with the\ncost of prosecution. (Item 12)\n8\npersuaded of a benign motive where Applicant has yet to make any effort to address his delinquent\nfilings. The DOHA Appeal Board held in ISCR Case No. 97-0176 (Jan. 22, 1998), \"The legal\nobligation to file income tax returns is independent and distinct from whether the taxpayer is entitled\nto receive a refund or not.\" DC \u00b6 31(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, and \u00b6 31(c)\nallegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged, formally prosecuted, or convicted, apply.\nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. The record is silent as to whether Applicant filed\nhis federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2005. Even if he filed his returns for 2005 on\ntime, MC \u00b6 32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement, does not apply. Despite\nan expressed desire to address his tax situation (\u201cWe desperately want to rectify this situation, file\nour tax returns, and if any outstanding taxes are owed, work out a plan to meet our obligations.\u201d),\nhe had taken no action toward filing his delinquent returns.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. AG \u00b6 2(a).\nApplicant\u2019s service in the Marines is viewed favorably (\u00b6  2(a) Available, reliable information about\nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a\ndetermination). Yet, his behavior since 2003 has not been what one would expect from someone\nwith 12 years in the military, where he was required to follow orders and to comply with rules and\nregulations. Considerable judgment concerns persist because of his ongoing disregard of his\nobligation to file income tax returns, his recent financial delinquency, and his violation of his\nemployer\u2019s policies regarding the use of a company-owned computer.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.

As\nof the date of his hearing, he had nine accounts, owing approximately $21,315 that have been\ndelinquent for many years. His financial problems were, to a limited extent, the result of\ncircumstances beyond his control, and he made some last minute efforts to resolve them.\nNotwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to show he is in control of his finances, he\nlacks a track record of financial responsibility, and his financial problems may be a concern in the\nfuture. More importantly, he deliberately falsified his security clearance application. Clearance is\ndenied. \n\n  GE 1 (Office of Personnel Management Security Clearance Application, Standard Form (SF) 86).\n1\n  See Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960, as amended,\n2\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan.\n2, 1992) (Directive), as amended. On August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a\nmemorandum directing application of revised adjudicative guidelines (Guidelines) to all adjudications and other\ndeterminations made under the Directive in which the SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n  Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was signed on January 26, 2007, and sworn on January 30, 2007.\n3\n  I left the record open to allow Applicant time to submit additional information in support of his case. AE 5\n4\nwas submitted after the hearing. It includes the government\u2019s transmittal letter, dated March 28, 2007, indicating no\nobjection to Applicant\u2019s documents.\n  GE 1, Supra, n. 1, unless indicated otherwise, is the source for the facts in this paragraph.\n5\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 13, 2004, Applicant submitted a security clearance application.  On January\n1\n11, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The SOR informed Applicant that, based on\ninformation available to the Government, DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary\naffirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to\nclassified information and submitted the case to an administrative judge for a security\ndetermination.  On January 30, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer) and requested a\n2\nhearing.3\nThe case was assigned to me on February 8, 2007. On March 7, 2007, I convened a hearing\nat which the government presented nine exhibits, marked GE 1-9, to support the SOR. Applicant\ntestified on his own behalf, and presented five exhibits, marked AE 1-5, which were admitted\nwithout objection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 15, 2007.\n4\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b61.a - 1.n with explanations. He admitted he\nprovided incorrect information in his response to SF 86 questions as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b62.a - 2.d. He\ndenied, however, doing so deliberately or with the intent to mislead the government. His admissions\nto the SOR allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the\npleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 41-year-old information technology technician.  He completed high school and\n5\nattended college for approximately one semester. He has no military. He married in September 1988,\nand divorced in July 1995. He has two children of this marriage, ages 17 (son) and 7 (daughter).\nApplicant paid child support for both children until 2006, when his son moved in with him. After\nthat, Applicant was no longer required to make child support payments. Applicant lives with his\ngirlfriend. \n\n  See Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR.\n6\n4\nFrom October 1983 to October 2002, he worked as a bridge operator for a state agency. In\n2002, he resigned from his job, seeking a career change. He also separated from his then girlfriend\nand moved to another state. From October 2002 to May 2003, he worked as an automobile detailer,\nbut his earnings were substantially reduced compared to his previous job. He has worked for his\ncurrent employer, a defense contractor, since May 2003 and requires access to classified information\nto retain his job.\nThe SOR alleges 14 delinquent/charged off accounts, some of which were duplicated or have\nbeen resolved. SOR \u00b61.a, \u00b61.b, and \u00b61.e allege the same debt/judgment in collection by two different\nentities. (AE 5) Around 2004 he was living in a rented apartment which flooded due to faulty\nplumbing. His property was damaged and he had to move to a different dwelling. He did not pay his\nrent, or honor the remainder of his apartment rental contract. His landlord filed legal proceedings\nagainst him. Applicant lost his case in court, and a judgment against him was filed in June 2004 for\napproximately $1,000. (Tr. 40-41) (GE 4)\n6\nApplicant knew he owed money to the landlord, but denied knowing there was a judgment\nfiled against him. He claimed he established a telephonic payment agreement with the creditor\n(apparently within 30 days of his hearing), and that he made his first payment of $275, with the\nbalance to be paid in April 2007. (Tr. 40-41, AE 1). He presented no evidence, other than his\ntestimony and his hand-written note (AE 1), to substantiate his claims.\nApplicant paid the debts alleged under \u00b61.g and \u00b61.h in or about March 2007. (AE 2, GE 9)\nConcerning SOR \u00b61.c, as of September 2006, Applicant owed $2,515 to a state for past due personal\nincome taxes for tax years 2001 and 2000. In 2006, Applicant entered into a payment agreement with\nthe state and has been making payments. (AE 5) \nHe acquired the debts alleged in \u00b61.d and \u00b61.f around April-May 2006, and they became\ndelinquent shortly thereafter. \u00b61.d was a small dollar loan he made to supplement his salary. (Tr. 54-\n55) \u00b61.f was a wireless account he had with his then girlfriend. In his answer to the SOR, he stated\nhe was in the process of drafting letters to contact these creditors and establish payment plans. He\npresented no evidence, other than his testimony, to substantiate his claims.\nThe delinquent debts alleged in \u00b61.i, \u00b61.j, and \u00b61.k were for credit card accounts he opened\nin May 2000, December 2001, and January 2004 (respectively), to pay for day to day living expenses\nand to purchase gifts for his children. For a short period of time he was able to make minimum\npayments on his debts. After a while, his earnings were not sufficient to pay both his debts and his\nday to day living expenses and he stopped making payments. In his answer to the SOR, he stated he\nwas in the process of drafting letters to contact these creditors and establish payment plans. He\npresented no evidence, other than his testimony, to substantiate his claims.\nSOR \u00b61.l concerns a 1998 BMW 528i Applicant purchased in 2002 with his sister as a\ncosigner on the car note. He claimed he used to work two jobs so he could afford making the car\npayments. When he quit his job and moved in 2002, he did not have the income he needed to make\nthe payments and had to return the vehicle to the dealer (voluntary repossession). He admitted owing\nthe debt, but disputed some of the charges. (Tr. 62) After his hearing, Applicant presented his 2006-\n\n  See Wachovia bank statements included in AE 5.

Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). Additionally,\neven though security concerns pertaining to an overdrawn account and returned checks are not alleged in the SOR, the\nJudge may consider these financial problems because they are relevant and factually related to a disqualifying condition\nthat was alleged in the SOR.

He\nfailed to honor his obligation and the hospital obtained a $1,113 judgment against him. He claimed\nto have been making payments of $25 a week toward the judgment. AE 5 shows a record of 21\npayments from March 2005 to March 2007. During that period of time, Applicant received credit\nfor making two payments of $34 and $108. The remaining 19 payments were identified as\n\u201cNSF/CAN.\u201d The debt alleged in \u00b61.n was satisfied in February 2007. The debt resulted from his\nfailure to pay property taxes on his car. The city applied Applicant\u2019s state income tax refund to cover\nthe $182 debt.\nApplicant testified this is the first time in his life where his financial situation has been out\nof control. He claimed that even though his financial situation has been poor, he has always tried to\npay his debts in good faith and to the best of his ability. He considers himself to be reliable,\ntrustworthy, and with good judgment. He explained his financial problems were the result of several\nfactors, i.e., the cut in pay he suffered when he resigned in 2002 after 19 years working for the same\nemployer (Tr. 91), moving from one state to another looking for a new career, his separation from\nhis then girlfriend, working for minimum wages from October 2002 to May 2003, and the passing\nof his mother. After finding employment in May 2003, his priorities became finding a place to stay\nand paying for his day to day necessities. He claimed he did not have enough income to support\nhimself and to pay for his delinquent debts.\nHe is in the process of establishing a debt management agreement with a financial\nmanagement company. He believes the company will assist him in negotiating payment plans with\nall of his creditors. (AE 3) As of the day of the hearing, he had not signed the debt management\nagreement. (Tr. 43, 66) In 2007, after receipt of the SOR, he sought a second job to supplement his\nearnings and to cover his future debt management agreement payments. His current income alone\nis not sufficient to cover the payments. (Tr. 44, 77) Applicant asserted that if he can get his security\nclearance, he has been promised a job with his current employer that pays twice as much as he is\ncurrently making. With that additional income, he believes he can pay all his delinquent obligations\nin a short period of time. (Tr. 79) \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant promised to contact his creditors in writing and\nestablish payment plans to resolve his debts. As of the day of his hearing, Applicant had failed to\nprovide evidence that he had done so. He promised, however, his intent to do so as soon as his\nhearing was over. (Tr. 112)\n\n  Directive, Section 6.3. Each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination\n8\nbased upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy\nin enclosure 2.\n  Guideline \u00b6 2(a). \u201c. . . The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as\n9\nthe whole person concept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable,\nshould be considered in reaching a determination. . . .\u201d The whole person concept includes the consideration of the nature\nand seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the age of the\napplicant; the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or\nundertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and the probability\nthat the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. \n6\nIn December 2004, Applicant submitted an Office of Personnel Management Security\nClearance Application, Standard Form (SF) 86. (GE 1) Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 36,\nwhich asked whether in the last seven years he had a lien placed against him for failure to pay taxes\nor other debts. He failed to disclose a $6,981 lien placed against him by the U.S. Department of\nTreasury Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in November 2003. He claimed that because he had\nestablished a payment plan with the IRS, he believed the lien had been removed. In his response to\nquestion 34, he disclosed the wage garnishments imposed by the IRS and the creditor in SOR \u00b61.n.\nHe also answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 37, which asked whether in the last seven years he had\nany judgments against him that had not been paid. He failed to disclose a $1,018 judgment entered\nagainst him in May 2004 that was unpaid (\u00b61.a). Applicant further answered \u201cNo\u201d to questions 38\nand 39, and failed to list any debts over 180 days delinquent he had during the last seven years, or\nany current debts over 90 days delinquent (respectively) (\u00b6\u00b61.e, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l). \nAt his hearing, Applicant admitted he knew about the delinquent debts that he failed to\ndisclose, but explained he did not know the extent of his debts. He claimed to have no knowledge\nof any judgments against him when he submitted his SF 86. He further claimed he had made\npayments to the creditors of the debts alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k, and did not believe the other\ndebts were sufficiently delinquent to justify disclosing them. He presented no evidence of the\nclaimed payment efforts. (Tr. 91-95)\nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Foremost are the Disqualifying and\nMitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to the facts and circumstances\nof the case. However, the guidelines are not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The presence\nor absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or\nagainst an Applicant. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive,  and the whole person concept.\n8\n9\nHaving considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) are the applicable relevant adjudicative\nguidelines.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\n\n  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n10\n  ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999)(Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less\n11\nthan a preponderance of the evidence.); ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 2006)(Substantial evidence is\nsuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the record.); Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n  Egan, 484 U.S. 518, at 528, 531.\n12\n  See, id.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n13\n  Guidelines \u00b6 18. \n14\n7\nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to determine whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\n10\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling\ninterest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness\nof one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. \nThe government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the SOR. To\nmeet its burden, the government must establish by substantial evidence  a prima facie case that it\n11\nis not clearly consistent with the national interest for the applicant to have access to classified\ninformation. The responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels\n12\nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information\nin favor of protecting national security.13\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations),  an Applicant\u2019s \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live\n14\nwithin one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack\nof judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\u201d \nApplicant has a history of failing to meet his financial obligations dating back to the late\n1990s. From 1999 to 2007, he accumulated significant debts resulting from spending beyond his\nmeans, quitting his long time job, separating from his then girl friend, relocation expenses, and\nperiods of underemployment. After receipt of the SOR in January 2007, he paid two of the twelve\ndelinquent/charged off debts alleged in the SOR (\u00b61.g and \u00b61.h) and entered into a payment\nagreement to settle the debt alleged in SOR \u00b61.l. He has three debts he is forcibly paying/paid as a\nresult of legal proceedings against him \u2013 \u00b61.c, \u00b61.m, and \u00b61.n. As of the day of the hearing, he still\nhad nine outstanding delinquent/charged off debts, owing approximately $21,315. Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\nand FC DC \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; apply in this case. \n\n  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at 4 (App. Bd.\n15\nMay 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered as a whole. \n8\nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) under Guidelines \u00b6 20(a)-(e)\nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts;\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due\ndebt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue.\nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,  I conclude Guidelines \u00b6 20(a) does not apply\n15\nbecause Applicant had multiple (nine) delinquent SOR debts at the time of his hearing, and he was\nnot making payments on many of the debts. \nApplicant established mitigating factors that I have considered, to a limited extent, as\ncircumstances beyond his control contributing to his inability to pay his debts -- i.e., quitting his long\ntime job, separating from his then girl friend, relocation expenses, and periods of underemployment.\nFC MC \u00b6 20(b), applies, but only in part, because Applicant failed to present evidence to show he\nacted responsibly under the circumstances. \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c), does not apply. Applicant gets some credit for contacting the financial\nservices firm to help him manage/deal with his creditors. I note his intent to participate in financial\ncounseling and establish a payment plan to resolve his debts. As of the day of the hearing, Applicant\nhad not signed his financial management assistance contract, and his income was not sufficient for\nhim to afford his future financial plan. His last minute efforts to resolve his delinquencies, however,\ndo not mitigate the concerns. What is more important, Applicant\u2019s evidence fails to show that his\nproblem is being resolved or is under control. I also considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d), and concluded it\ndoes not apply. Applicant\u2019s last minute payment/settlement efforts do not rise to the level of full\n\u201cgood-faith efforts\u201d to repay creditors. FC MC \u00b6 20(e), does not apply. Applicant failed to provide\nadequate documentation showing his actions to resolve his financial problems.\nOn balance, and after careful deliberation, Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show he\nhas dealt responsibly with his financial obligations. He presented little evidence to show he dealt\nresponsibly with his financial obligations before receipt of the SOR (i.e., paid debts, settlements,\ndocumented negotiations, payment plans, budgets, financial assistance/counseling). Applicant\u2019s\n\n  Guidelines, \u00b6 15.\n16\n9\nfinancial history and lack of favorable evidence preclude a finding that he has established a track\nrecord of financial responsibility, or that he has taken control of his financial situation. He is\nfinancially overextended and failed to show that he has the means to deal with both his delinquent\ndebts and his day to day living expenses. His financial problems are likely to be a concern in the\nfuture. I find Applicant\u2019s financial problems are recent, not isolated, and ongoing.\nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct), \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack\nof candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d16\nApplicant admitted he failed to disclose relevant information in his answers to SF 86\nquestions 36, 37, 38 and 39. He denied, however, that it was done with the deliberate intent to falsify\nhis answers or to mislead the government. In light of Applicant\u2019s admissions, age, length of\nemployment, the number and value of the debts, liens, and judgments that he failed to disclose, the\ncircumstances under which he acquired those obligations, and his testimony and demeanor, I find\nApplicant\u2019s omissions with respect to questions 37, 38, and 39 were deliberate and made with the\nintent to mislead the government. These were his personal debts and he knew they were delinquent\nbecause he had made no effort to resolve them. Further, a judge told him in open court that he was\nresponsible for the debt alleged in \u00b61.a at the time he granted a judgment against Applicant.\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire . . ., applies.\nI specifically considered all Guideline E Mitigating Conditions (\u00b6 17) and concluded that\nnone apply. Although the falsification occurred in 2004, considering the totality of the circumstances\nin Applicant\u2019s case, the passage of time alone is not sufficient to mitigate the security concerns raised\nby his behavior. Furthermore, he presented no evidence that he has reduced his vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. Additionally, for the same reasons outlined above under the\ndiscussion of Guidelines F, incorporated herein, I conclude Applicant\u2019s behavior shows questionable\njudgment, lack of reliability, and untrustworthiness. Guideline E is decided against Applicant.\nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines. I applied the whole person concept.\nI specifically considered Applicant\u2019s maturity, and his four years of good performance working for\na defense contractor. Considering the totality of Applicant\u2019s circumstances, Applicant demonstrated\na lack in judgment and trustworthiness in the handling of his financial affairs. He failed to show\nsufficient efforts to resolve his financial situation. He carried his delinquencies for many years and\nit was not until after he received the SOR that he made some effort to resolve three of the debts.\nMoreover, Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to mitigate the overall judgment, honesty,\nand trustworthiness security concerns raised by his falsifications, and the likelihood of recurrence\nremains a concern.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n10\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation as required by Directive Section E3.1.25 are\nas follows:\nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations (Guideline F)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.i - 1.m\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.n\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct (Guideline E)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.b - 2.d\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Clearance is granted.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a\nsecurity clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992),\nas amended and modified (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines approved by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006 (AG).  The SOR\nalleged facts raising security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 25, 2006, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 11, 2007, and heard on May\n30, 2007, as scheduled.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 8, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 43-year-old laser engineer for a defense contractor.  He has worked for his\ncurrent employer since January 2004.  He worked as a laser engineer for another defense contractor\nfrom May 1999 to January 2004.  He does not hold a security clearance.  His manager and facility\nsecurity officer regard him as talented, honest, hard-working, devoted, and of high moral character\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A and B).\nApplicant was born in Cuba.  In 1983, he went to Russia, where he obtained a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree in mathematics and physics from Moscow University in 1989.  He married a Cuban citizen\nin August 1987. He returned to Cuba in 1989, taught at Havana University School of Nuclear\nPhysics, and worked for a research institute in Cuba.  He became politically unpopular because he\nconsidered the Cuban nuclear program \u201ca farce,\u201d and he encouraged students in the nuclear program\nto move into other areas.  He returned to Russia in 1993 at the invitation of his brother\u2019s ex-wife,\nintending to make his way to the U.S.  He applied for and was granted political asylum in the U.S.\nin 1993 (AX I).  His wife, a medical doctor, and his daughter, then four years old, came to the U.S.\nin 1994.  He obtained a master\u2019s degree in physics from a university in the U.S. and was working\non a doctorate when he left school to support his family (Tr. 8).\nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in December 2001, and his wife became a U.S. citizen in\nFebruary 2004.  His daughter recently became a U.S. citizen (AX C; Tr. 28).  He has two sons who\nare native-born U.S. citizens (AX D and E).  \nWhen Applicant left Cuba in 1993, he left behind a 5-year-old daughter.  He had no contact\nwith her until she contacted him by email about a year-and-a-half ago, asking about her brothers and\nsisters (Tr. 39).  She is a university student and lives with her mother in Cuba.  Although the record\nis somewhat unclear, it appears that the mother of this daughter is not Applicant\u2019s current spouse.\n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s mother, brother, and sister are citizens and residents of Cuba.  A second sister\nin Cuba died in 2006.  He has virtually no contact with his brother and sister (Tr. 57-58).  \nApplicant\u2019s mother resided with him in the U.S. from July 2000 to July 2001, when she\nreturned to Cuba.  She is 67 years old, a retired medical records clerk, and in poor health.  She\nreceives a retirement pension from the Cuban government.  She has owned her home for 35 years\n(Tr. 42, 58-59).  Applicant sends his mother $100 or $200 on an irregular basis, based on his feelings\nof obligation rather than any legal requirement.  He has occasional telephone contact with her on\nspecial occasions (Tr. 45).  His mother plans to visit him again in 2008 (Tr. 56).\nApplicant is financially secure.  He owns his own home with an assessed value more than\n$400,000, as well as a second home assessed at more than $336,000 and a condominium assessed\nat more than $168,000 (AX F, G, and H). He has mutual funds worth more than $8,000, retirement\naccounts worth more than $77,000, and education accounts for his three children in the U.S. totaling\nmore than $20,000 (AX L).\nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law and mother-in-law are Cuban citizens residing in the U.S.  They\nalso were granted political asylum in the U.S. (Tr. 48).  They have not become citizens because of\ntheir limited ability to communicate in English.  His father-in-law works for a commercial shipping\ncompany, and he earned more than $116,000 during 2006, including almost $69,000 in overtime\n(AX K).\nApplicant was a member of a Communist youth organization as a student.  He would have\nbeen unable to study physics or go to Moscow if he had not joined the organization (Tr. 65-66).\nHowever, his family members remaining in Cuba are not members of the Communist Party, nor are\nthey politically active or members of any dissident groups (Tr. 64-65).\nCuba is a totalitarian state. The government controls all aspects of life through the\nCommunist Party and its affiliated organizations, the government bureaucracy, and the Department\nof State Security.  It has a poor human rights record because of beatings and abuse of detainees and\nprisoners, harsh prison conditions, arbitrary arrest and detention of human rights advocates, denial\nof fair trial, pervasive monitoring of private communications, limitations on freedom of speech and\npress, denial of peaceful assembly, and restrictions on freedom of movement, including selective\ndenial of exit permits. The government and its agents are not known to engage in politically\nmotivated killings or disappearances, but dissidents risk being jailed.\nCuba is a state sponsor of terrorism, maintains close relationships with Iran and North Korea,\nand has offered safe havens for terrorist organizations.  The Cuban government has long targeted the\nU.S. for intensive espionage.  Cuba\u2019s modus operandi in espionage operations is to use spies to\ninfiltrate U.S. activities and U.S.-based anti-government organizations.\nThe U.S. and Cuba have had a strained relationship since the early 1960s.  U.S. policy has\nbeen to isolate Cuba through comprehensive economic sanctions.  At the same time, the U.S. has\nsupported humanitarian efforts for a \u201cFree Cuba,\u201d and has supported efforts to break the\n\nI granted Department Counsel\u2019s request to take administrative notice of adjudicative facts regarding the Cuban\n1\ngovernment and its human rights record (Tr. 26).  I also granted Applicant\u2019s request to take administrative notice of facts\ncontained in the government\u2019s supporting documentation (Tr. 40-41, 63).\n5\n\u201cinformation blockade\u201d by funding radio and television broadcasts and expanding access to\nindependent information through the internet.1\nApplicant is well aware of the possibility of pressure on his family members in Cuba.  He\nhas considered that possibility and decided that he will report any such attempts and that he will\nresist them.  His loyalty is to the U.S. and his family in the U.S.  He was very emphatic about his\nreaction to any attempts to pressure his family: \u201cI will definitely report and there won\u2019t be any\nquestion about to whom I will be loyal.  I mean I will be loyal to the United States that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s no\nquestion.\u201d  (Tr. 61.)\nAt the hearing, Applicant was intense and emotional when talking about his immediate\nfamily and in-laws who reside in the U.S.  He was more detached and matter-of-fact when talking\nabout his mother, and diffident when talking about his daughter, brother, and sister in Cuba.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the AG.  Each clearance decision\nmust be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each specific guideline, and the factors listed in the AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\n\n6\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a\nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that\nis not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication\nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether\nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or\nis associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6.\nA disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business\nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country\nif that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(a).  Applicant has virtually no contact with his brother and sister in Cuba, but\nhe maintains regular contact with his mother and some passive contact with his Cuban daughter.  I\nconclude this disqualifying condition is raised.\nA disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation\nto protect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b).  This condition is raised by Applicant\u2019s\nconnections to his mother and daughter.\nA security concern also may be raised if an applicant is \u201csharing living quarters with a person\nor persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(d).  This condition is not raised, because\nApplicant\u2019s spouse and her parents reside in the U.S., have no connections to Cuba,  and are deeply\ncommitted to the U.S.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6\n7(a) and (b), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating\n\n7\ncondition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.  See ISCR Case No.\n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions\nor activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed\nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization,\nor government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a).  When family ties are at issue, the totality\nof an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be\nconsidered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United States has\na compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person,\norganization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person,\norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-\n11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over\nmatters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly\nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific,\nand technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd.\nMar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S.,\nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family\nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is\nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is\nassociated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence\noperations against the U.S.\nApplicant has no meaningful relationship with his brother and sister.  He abandoned his\ndaughter when he left Cuba in 1993, and he had no contact with her until she contacted him.  He has\nresponded to her contacts, but he appears to be a passive partner in the relationship.  However, he\nhas ties of affection and obligation to his mother, and could be placed in a position of choosing to\nprotect his mother or the interests of the U.S.  I conclude the mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 8(a) is not\nestablished.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is no conflict\nof interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in\nfavor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(b).  Based on this record, I conclude Applicant\u2019s sense of loyalty\nor obligation to his brother, sister, and daughter are \u201cminimal.\u201d  His sense of obligation to his mother\nis more than \u201cminimal,\u201d but Applicant made it clear that both he and his mother understand the risk.\nApplicant\u2019s economic status would allow him to financially support his mother if he needed to.  The\nrisk of detention and mistreatment by Cuban authorities is real, but is lessened by his mother\u2019s lack\nof political involvement.  Cuba is known to mistreat dissidents, but she is not a dissident.  There is\nno evidence that Cuba\u2019s espionage activities include mistreatment of its own citizens to indirectly\ncoerce U.S. citizens.\n\n8\nApplicant severed his ties to Cuba when left in 1993 and sought political asylum in the U.S.\nHis family ties, professional ties, his future, and his children\u2019s future are now all closely tied to the\nU.S. After weighing all the evidence, considering Applicant\u2019s testimony, and observing his\ndemeanor at the hearing, I am convinced that he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the\nU.S.  Accordingly, I conclude that the mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 8(b) is established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing that \u201ccontact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it\ncould create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(c).  Applicant\u2019s contact with his\nbrother and sister is virtually nonexistent.  His contact with his daughter is recent, but passive, and\ndoes not appear to have progressed beyond casual social contact.  However, he has regular contact\nwith his mother and sends her money.  His mother visited him for a year in 2000-2001 and is\nplanning another visit.  Considering the totality of Applicant\u2019s family contacts as well as his contacts\nwith individual family members, I conclude this mitigating condition is not established.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a)(1)-(9).  Some of these factors were discussed above, but some merit additional comment.\nApplicant is a mature, well-educated, very intelligent person.  He rejected Cuba in 1993 and\nleft his mother, brother, sister, and one daughter behind.  His disdain for the Cuban government was\nobvious during the hearing.  In contrast, he has developed very strong bonds in the U.S., and the\nintensity of those bonds was apparent at the hearing.  Except for his mother, he has no significant\nties of affection or obligation to anyone in Cuba.  He has carefully considered the possibility that he\ncould be pressured indirectly through his mother, and he has made a thoughtful decision to resist any\nsuch efforts.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, and evaluating\nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcerns based on foreign influence.  Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\n\n9\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

On June 20, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested that his case be decided on the written record.  On May 31, 2007,\nafter considering the record, Administrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony denied Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant with respect to SOR paragraph 2.a.  That favorable finding is not at issue\n1\non appeal.\nApplicant elected to have his case decided on the written record.  Therefore, the Judge did not have the\n2\nopportunity to evaluate the credibility of Applicant\u2019s statements in the context of a hearing.\nApplicant was granted a security clearance in 2001.\n3\n2\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision under Guidelines H and E is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge should have concluded that the security concerns raised under\nGuidelines H and E had been mitigated, as a matter of law, because Applicant\u2019s drug use occurred\nin the past, Applicant has demonstrated that he would not use drugs in the future, and Applicant\nprovided clear evidence of rehabilitation.   In support of this argument, Applicant points to the\n1\nfavorable evidence in the record, including his statement that he did not intend to use drugs in the\nfuture,  his outstanding work record, and the fact that he has tested negative for illegal substances\n2\non recent drug tests.  He also contends that his single use of marijuana in 2004,  while holding a\n3\nsecurity clearance, was an isolated incident\u2014distinct from his approximately ten uses in college\nfrom 1996 to 2000.  Given the totality of the record evidence, Applicant\u2019s arguments do not\ndemonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn\nsimply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case. Rather, their\napplication requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d See\nISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  \u201cThus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.\u201d  See\nISCR Case No. 05-02833 (App. Bd. Mar.19, 2007).  \u201cAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the\nevidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence,\nor vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability\nto argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 05-03143 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\nIn this case, the Judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy history of marijuana use by\nan Applicant who was familiar with the security clearance process.  That history included illegal\nmarijuana use from approximately 1996 to at least August 2004.  It also included the illegal\nmarijuana use while holding a security clearance granted by the Department of Defense.  A review\nof the decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against\nthe record evidence relating to the length, seriousness and recency of the disqualifying conduct, and\nconsidered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  The\nJudge found in favor of the Applicant with respect to one of the factual allegations.  However, the\nJudge reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was\ninsufficient to overcome all the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case\nde novo.  Given the record that was before her, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision\n\n3\nunder Guidelines H and E is not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n04-12548  at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006).\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D. Billett       \nJeffrey D.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and\n1\nmodified.\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified.\nApplicant\u2019s original submission consisted of 13 exhibits.  His first exhibit was a copy of the Statement of\n3\nReasons, dated June 20, 2006.  His second exhibit was his Answer to the Statement of Reasons, dated July 20, 2006. \nSince the Statement of Reasons and Applicant\u2019s Answer to the Statement of Reasons were already in the record , I did\nnot admit them as Applicant\u2019s exhibits. (See FORM, Items 1 and 3.) \n2\nApplicant, 29 years old and unmarried, is employed as a software engineer by a defense\ncontractor. In 2001, he was granted a security clearance.  In approximately 2002, he committed a\nsecurity violation by failing to remove and secure computer hard drives containing classified\ninformation at the end of the work day.  Applicant used  marijuana intermittently from 1996 to 2004.\nIn 2004, when he was 26 and holding a security clearance, he used marijuana with friends at a\nconcert.  While Applicant mitigated a Guideline E security violation concern, he failed to mitigate\nsecurity concerns related to drug use under Guidelines E and H.  Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant.  On June 20, 2006, under the applicable Executive Order  and Department\n1\nof Defense Directive,  DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its\n2\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on July 20, 2006.  He requested\nhis case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled its File of\nRelevant Material (FORM) on March 29, 2007.  The FORM contained documents identified as Items\n1 through 5 .  Additionally, one official U.S. Government document, an except entitled \u201cMarijuana,\u201d\nprinted September 27, 2006, from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration website was offered for\nadministrative notice. (See http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/concern/marijuana.html.)\nOn March 29, 2007, a copy of the FORM was forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to\nsubmit any additional information and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the\nfile on April 9, 2007.  On May 10, 2007, Applicant submitted additional information, consisting of a\nfive-page Discussion and Argument and 11 exhibits.    Department Counsel did not object to the\n3\nadmission of Applicant\u2019s Discussion and Argument and exhibits.  On May 22, 2007, the case was\nassigned to me for a decision.  After a careful review, I marked Applicant\u2019s Discussion and Argument\nas exhibit (Ex.) A, and I marked his 11 exhibits as Exs. B through L and admitted them to the record\nof this case.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR contains two allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline H, Drug\nInvolvement, and two allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline E, Personal Conduct.\n\n3\n(Item 1.)  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all four allegations. (Item 3.)  His admissions\nare incorporated as findings of fact.\nApplicant is 29 years old and single.  He graduated from college in June 2001 and in July 2001\nwent to work for employer A, a defense contractor, as a software engineer II.  He was employed by\nEmployer A until October 2004, when the employer closed the branch Applicant was assigned to.\nRather than go with the branch to another city, Applicant elected not to move and to find a new job.\nIn approximately 2002, while he was employed by Employer A, Applicant committed a\nsecurity violation.  He and another employee failed to remove and secure computer hard drives\ncontaining classified information before leaving the workplace at the end of the work day.  He and the\nother employee were given verbal warnings from their employer for the security violation.  Applicant\nstated that at the time of the security violation, he and the other employee were working 12 to 14 hour\ndays to make progress on a project that was behind schedule.  Applicant stated he and his co-worker\narmed the proper locks when leaving the work site, even though they had not removed and secured the\nhard drives containing classified information as they were required to do.  He speculated he and his\nco-worker were guilty of a practice dangerous to security but had not committed a security violation.\n(Item 3 at 1-2.)  \nIn November 2004, Applicant took a job as a software engineer with another defense contractor\n(Employer B).  He worked for Employer B until September 2006, when he returned to Employer A\nas a senior software engineer, in order to be closer to his fiancee.  (Ex. A, Argument; Item 4; Item 5.)\nAs an employee of Employer A, Applicant seeks eligibility for a security clearance.  (Applicant\u2019s\nsigned receipt of SOR, dated April 9, 2007.)     \nApplicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from about June 1996 to at least August\n2004.  He was granted a security clearance in approximately November 2001.  While employed by\nEmployer A and while holding a security clearance, he used marijuana in August 2004.  DOHA\nalleged Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana while holding a security clearance security raised security\nconcerns not only under the Drug Involvement guideline but also under the Personal Conduct\nguideline. \n  \nOn October 12, 2001, Applicant completed and certified an electronic security clearance\napplication (SF-86).  Question 27 on the SF-86 reads as follows:\nYour Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Illegal Use of Drugs.\nSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you\nillegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana,\ncocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine,\nheroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone,\ntranquilizers, etc.) hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription\ndrugs?    \nApplicant responded \u201cyes\u201d to Question 27 and reported he had used marijuana two times\nbetween June 25, 1996 and June 26, 1996.  (Item 5.)\n\n4\nApplicant completed a second electronic SF-86 in October 2005.  On October 11, 2005, he\nsigned and certified the following statement:\nMy statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true,\ncomplete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are\nmade in good faith.  I understand that a knowing and willful false\nstatement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or\nboth. (See section 1001 of title 18, United States Code).\nSection 24 on the SF-86 that Applicant completed in October 2005 uses language identical to\nQuestion 27, quoted above, to inquire about an Applicant\u2019s use of illegal drugs and controlled\nsubstances.  In October 2005, Applicant responded \u201cyes\u201d to Section 24.  He admitted he used\nmarijuana in August 2004 once at a concert he was attending with friends.  He also admitted marijuana\nuse three times between January 2000 and June 2000, with the additional comment: \u201cTried it in\ncollege.\u201d (Item 4.) \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated he attended a concert with three friends in August\n2004.  He stated he and his friends were looking forward to a good time at the concert.  Before the\nconcert began, Applicant and his friends smoked a joint that was passed around by other fans  at the\nconcert. Applicant expressed regret for using marijuana in 2004 while holding a security clearance.\nHe stated he had used marijuana \u201cno more than 10 times during his college years from June 1996 -\nJune 2000.\u201d  He stated he did not intend to use marijuana again, and he denied any other illegal drug\nuse while holding a security clearance.  (Item 3 at 1.)\nApplicant submitted exhibits showing negative drug tests at the start of his employment in\n2001 and 2006 and in May 2007.  (Ex. B, Ex. C, and Ex. D.)  He submitted his performance appraisals\nfor the periods July 2001 to June 2002  (Ex. E), June 2002 to June 2003 (Ex. F), June 2003 to June\n2004  (Ex. G), November 25, 2004 (Ex. H), and 2006 to 2007 (Ex. I).  His employers noted Applicant\nexceeds job requirements in most cases, was mature and reliable, and \u201cthe ultimate team player.\u201d (Ex.\nA at 3.)  Additionally, Applicant supplied three letters of character reference from co-workers, who\npraised him as reliable, competent, good-natured, honest, and capable.  (Ex. J, Ex. K, Ex. L) \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.\nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility\nfor access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20,\n1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case\nNo. 01-20700 at 3.\n\n5\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating the security\nworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\nnecessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  The Directive presumes a\nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed\nin the guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd.\nMay 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden\nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at\n3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nIn the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana, with varying\nfrequency from about June 1996 to at least August 2004 (\u00b6 1.a.) and that he continued to use marijuana\nafter being granted a security clearance in November 2001 (\u00b6 1.b.).\nThe Government\u2019s concern with Guideline H conduct is that it raises questions regarding an\nindividual\u2019s ability or willingness to protect classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may\nimpair social or occupational functioning, thereby increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure\nof classified information.  \u00b6 E2.A8.1.1.1.\nDrugs are defined under Guideline H as mood and behavior-altering substances, including\ndrugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act\nof 1970, as amended, and inhalants and other similar substances. \u00b6\u00b6 E2.A8.1.1.2., E2.A8.1.1.2.1.,\nE2.A8.1.1.2.2.  Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates\nfrom approved medical direction.  \u00b6 E2.A8.1.1.3.  Marijuana, or cannabis, is identified and listed in\nthe Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended, as a controlled substance.  \nFrom Applicant\u2019s admissions, the Government has established a prima facie case that he  used\nmarijuana intermittently for over eight years between 1996 and at least August 2004 and that he used\nmarijuana after being granted a security clearance in November 2001.  Applicant has admitted\n\nDC E2.A8.1.2.1 reads, in pertinent part: \u201cAny drug abuse.\u201d  DC E2.A8.1.2.2. reads: \u201cIllegal drug possession,\n4\nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, and distribution.\u201d\nDC E2.A8.1.2.5. reads, in pertinent part: \u201cRecent drug involvement, especially following the granting of a\n5\nsecurity clearance, or an expressed intent not to discontinue use, will almost invariably result in an unfavorable\ndetermination.\u201d\nMC E2.A8.1.3.1. reads: \u201cThe drug involvement was not recent.\u201d  \n6\nMC E2.A8.1.3.2. reads: \u201cThe drug involvement was an isolated or aberrational event.\u2019\n7\nMC E2.A8.1.3.3. reads: \u201cA demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.\u201d\n8\n6\nGuideline H drug involvement specified in the SOR and identified as disqualifying under\nDisqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A8.1.2.1., DC E2.A8.1.2.2.,  and DC E2.A8.1.2.5.\n4\n5\nThe record shows that Applicant\u2019s involvement with marijuana began as a college student and\ncontinued through his college and post-college years.  Applicant\u2019s estimate of the amount of his\nmarijuana use varied.  On his 2001 SF-86, he admitted using marijuana only twice in a two-day period\nin 1996.  On his 2005 SF-86, he admitted using marijuana three times between January and June 2000.\nHe also admitted using marijuana in August 2004 while at a concert with friends.  In his answer to the\nSOR, Applicant admitted using marijuana \u201cno more than 10 times\u201d during his college years.  Applicant\nprovided no explanation for his failure to list his 2000 drug use on his 2001 SF-86.  \nApplicant stated his last drug use occurred in August 2004, almost three years ago.  Thus, his\ndrug involvement was not recent, and, accordingly, Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A8.1.3.1.  applies.\n6\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s marijuana use, although sometimes sporadic and intermittent, spanned a period\nof approximately eight years of his adolescence and young adulthood.  Thus, his drug involvement was\nneither isolated nor aberrational and represented a lifestyle choice.  Therefore, MC E2.A8.1.3.2.  does\n7\nnot apply.\nApplicant asserted he did not intend to use marijuana in the future.  While this assertion\nappeared credible on its face, Applicant provided no plan or rationale for abstaining from the use of\nmarijuana and how he would avoid using the drug if he continued to associate with people who use\nmarijuana.  Absent some clear demonstration of how he planned to abstain from marijuana use, and\na measurable track record showing abstinence, Applicant failed to show that MC E2.A8.1.3.3.  is\n8\napplicable.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nIn the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant raised concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct,\nwhen he committed  a security violation in approximately 2002, while working for Employer A, by\nfailing to remove and secure hard drives containing classified information before leaving the office\nat the end of the work day.  Applicant and another employee received verbal warnings from their\nemployer for this security violation. (SOR \u00b6 2.a.)  DOHA also alleged that Applicant\u2019s use of\nmarijuana in 2004, after having been granted a security clearance in November 2001, raised security\nconcerns under Guideline E.  (SOR \u00b6 2.b.)\n\nMC E2.A5.1.3.1. reads, in pertinent part: \u201cThe  information was . . . not pertinent to a determination of\n9\njudgment, trustworthiness, or reliability.\u201d\nMC E2.A5.1.3.5. reads: \u201cThe individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate\n10\nvulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d  \n7\nGuideline E conduct, which involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, could indicate an\napplicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.1.1.\nWith respect to the Guideline E conduct alleged in the SOR, the Government has established\nits case.  The Government established, and Applicant admitted, that he committed a security violation\nin 2002 and used marijuana in 2004, while holding an active security clearance granted in 2001.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct raises concerns under Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A5.1.2.5. because it\nsuggests a pattern of rule violation.  His failure to follow rules for protecting classified information\nin 2002 resulted in a security violation and a verbal warning from his employer.  His willingness to\nbreak rules and violate laws by using  marijuana while holding a security clearance suggests that, under\nsome circumstances, he may put his interests before those of the Government.\nApplicant\u2019s security violation was a one-time event, early in his employment with a Defense\ncontractor.  Applicant presented credible evidence showing he had developed into a responsible\nprofessional and had not been charged with any additional security violations since his first and only\none in 2002.  Further, his laudable employment record indicated it was unlikely he would commit a\nsecurity violation in the future.  Accordingly, I conclude that Guideline E Mitigating Condition (MC)\nE2.A5.1.3.1. is applicable.   Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana in 2004, while holding a security clearance\n9\ngranted in 2001, occurred while he was a young professional of 26. It is unclear from the record\nwhether he continues to associate with individuals who use marijuana or to visit places where illegal\ndrugs are openly used, thus exposing himself to the possibility of coercion, exploitation, or duress and\nignoring the reality that illegal drug use is criminal behavior.  Thus Mitigating Condition (MC)\nE2.A5.1.3.5.  is inapplicable.  No other Guideline E mitigating conditions apply.\n10\nWhole Person Analysis\nParagraph E2.2 of the Directive requires that the adjudicative process in a security clearance\ncase not only assess conduct under the adjudicative guidelines, but it must also reflect a careful\nweighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  The factors to be considered\nin a whole person analysis include the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct (E2.2.1.1); the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation (E2.2.1.2); the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct (E2.2.1.3); the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the\nconduct (E2.2.1.4.); the voluntariness of participation (E2.2.1.5.); the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes (E2.2.1.6); the motivation for the conduct\n(E2.2.1.7); the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (E2.2.1.8.); and, the likelihood\nfor continuation or recurrence (E2.2.1.9).\nApplicant voluntarily admitted his marijuana use in adolescence and college and while holding\na  security clearance.  His drug use, while intermittent, was habitual and spanned a period from 1996\n\n8\nto 2004.  His last drug use occurred when he was 26 years old and holding a security clearance,\nsuggesting a pattern of rule violation and unreliability.\nI have reviewed and considered all of the evidence.  After weighing the applicable Guideline\nH and E disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and after considering all relevant factors in the whole\nperson analysis, I conclude Guideline H allegations 1.a. and 1.b against Applicant, Guideline E\nallegation 2.a. for Applicant, and Guideline E allegation 2.b. against Applicant.  \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern.  Security\nclearance decisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past\ntransgressions.  Rather, the objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, common\nsense assessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.  Indeed,\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his or her acts and\nomissions, including all disqualifying and mitigating conduct.  Having done so, I conclude Applicant\nshould not be entrusted with a security clearance.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the\nevidence as a whole, including the appropriate factors and guidelines in Department of Defense\nDirective, 5220.6., as amended\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline H.:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.\nGuideline E.: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2. a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Clearance\nis denied.\nJoan Caton Anthony\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Campbell, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant's alcohol abuse has resulted in at least three alcohol-related incidents, the last\noccurring in 2004. While Applicant continues to consume alcohol, he no longer consumes alcohol\n\n2\nto excess, nor does he drive after consuming any alcohol. Mitigation has been shown. Clearance is\ngranted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 23, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant  filed a notarized response, dated May 16, 2007, to the allegations set forth in the\nSOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge. On June 26, 2007, the case was\nassigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing. Pursuant to formal notice, dated August\n6, 2007, a hearing was held on August 24, 2007. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered five documentary exhibits (Government\u2019s\nExhibits 1-5) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered one documentary exhibit (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit A) and offered his own testimony. The transcript (Tr) was received on September 10, 2007.\nThe record was left open to allow Applicant to introduce letters of reference and evaluations. A letter\nfrom Applicant and three character letters were timely offer into evidence. No objection being raised,\nthe four letters are identified and entered into evidence as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the Directive. The SOR\ncontains five allegations, 1.a. through 1.e., under Guideline J, and two allegations, 2.a., and  2.b.,\nunder Guideline G. Applicant admitted all of the specific SOR allegations except 2.a.  The admitted\nallegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and testimony of Applicant, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 53 years old. He is currently married for the fourth time, and he has three adult\nchildren. He has worked in the aerospace industry fro almost 35 years. He is currently employed by\na defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in\nthe defense sector.\n\n3\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nhe has engaged in criminal acts.\n1.a.  Applicant was arrested in April 1985 for unlawful possession of a machine gun, which\nis a felony. Applicant testified that the gun he fired was an M16, which he had built, himself. He\nfired several rounds in his mother\u2019s backyard to show his sons how the gun worked. He plead guilty\nto discharging a firearm in the city limits, a misdemeanor, and he paid a fine and was placed on three\nyears summary probation. \n1.b.  Applicant was charged in November 2004 with the illegal possession of a switch blade\nknife. This charge occurred at the same time that he was stopped for  1.e., as discussed below. The\nknife was part of a knife collection that he owned, and it was found in the glove compartment of his\nvehicle. He was not aware that the knife was considered an illegal switchblade. This charge was\nultimately dismissed (Exhibit A). \n1.c.  In March 1986, Applicant was arrested and charged with 1) Driving Under the Influence\n(DUI) with bodily injury; and 2) DUI with a .08% blood alcohol level, with bodily injury; 3) DUI\nwith a .08% blood alcohol level. Applicant plead no contest  to Count 3 and Counts 1 and 2 were\ndismissed. He was placed on thirty six months summary probation, ordered to pay a fine, attend a\n90 day alcohol awareness program, and his driver\u2019s license was restricted to driving to and from his\nemployment.\n1.d.  In April  1987, Applicant was arrested and charged with 1) Driving Under the Influence\n(DUI); and 2) DUI with a .08% blood alcohol level or more. Applicant plead guilty to Count 2, and\nCount 1 was dismissed. He was placed on thirty six months summary probation, ordered to pay a\nfine, attend a one year alcohol awareness program, to attend 26 meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous\n(AA), and his driver\u2019s license was restricted for one year.\n1.e  In November 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with 1) Driving Under the\nInfluence (DUI); and 2) DUI with a .08% blood alcohol level or more. Applicant plead guilty to\nCount 1, and Count 2 was dismissed. He was placed on thirty six months summary probation,\nordered to pay a fine and other costs of $2,625, which he paid, and to attend a one year alcohol\nawareness program (Exhibit A).\nParagraph 2 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption). \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nhe abuses alcohol to excess.  \n2.a. Applicant has consumed alcohol at times in excess and to the point of intoxication, from\napproximately 1986 to at least November 2004. \n2.b.  Applicant's conduct which has been alleged in the SOR as 1.c., 1.e., and 1.d.,\n\n4\nrespectively, is included  in this paragraph under alcohol consumption. \nIn his  responses to interrogatories, that he signed on October 7, 2006, (Exhibit 3) Applicant\nstated, \u201cIt is my desire to stop drinking alcohol all together (sic).\u201d Applicant testified that he\ncontinues to consume alcohol, although he claims to consume far less alcohol than he did previously,\nand it is still his stated desire to eventually abstain completely from alcohol consumption.  Applicant\nwas adamant and credible that he does not and will not drive after he consumes any alcoholic\nbeverage.\nMitigation\nApplicant introduced three character letters, one from his wife, the second  from a co-worker\nand personal friend, and the third  from his direct supervisor (Exhibit B). All of the individuals spoke\nvery highly about Applicant\u2019s character and none of the three believed that Applicant had a\ncontinuing alcohol problem. \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.\nAs set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, \"In evaluating the relevance of\nan individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following factors [General\nFactors]:\na. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng. The motivation for the conduct\nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\n\n5\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse and criminal conduct that\ndemonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\" The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government's case. The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that\nApplicant has engaged in several criminal acts (Guideline J), that he has used and continues to use\nalcohol at times to excess (Guideline G). Applicant, on the other hand, has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's\ncase against him.\n(Guideline J -Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government has established by substantial evidence that Applicant engaged in criminal\nconduct, as he was arrested for, and convicted of three DUI criminal offenses. Applicant also\ndischarged a firearm illegally in the city. \nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline J, DC 31. (a), a single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses, applies in this case. Under Mitigation conditions (MC), I\nfind that MC 32. (d) applies to this Applicant, as there is evidence of successful rehabilitation;\nincluding but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, and sincere\nremorse.  Applicant has mitigated this allegation. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \n\n6\n(Guideline G -Alcohol Consumption) \nApplicant's alcohol consumption has resulted in three alcohol related arrests and convictions.\nAs to the amount of alcohol he now consumes, as discussed above, Applicant continues to consume\nalcohol, but he consumes it far less frequently and in smaller amounts than previously.  Of his three\narrests, two occurred more than twenty years ago, 1986 and 1987, and the third happened in 2004.\nThe Government established, by substantial evidence, that Applicant was involved in\nalcohol-related incidents away from work, driving under the influence, which is DC 22. (a), and DC\n(c ) that he engaged in habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment.\nApplicant continues to consume alcohol on a regular basis, but he has  reformed his habit of driving\nafter consuming alcohol. \nI find that  MC 23. (a) applies as so much time as passed, certainly with his first two DUIs\nand almost three years since his most current DUI, and the behavior was infrequent, three times in\na period of more than twenty years, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability and trustworthiness.  Paragraph 2 is found for Applicant.\n        \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's information\nopposing his request for a security clearance. Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding for\nApplicant as to the allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's SOR. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

On August 31,\n2006, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise\ntrustworthiness concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline F (financial considerations).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to\nme on November 16, 2006, and I convened a hearing on January 11, 2007, at which the parties\nappeared as scheduled. The government offered 12 exhibits, all of which were admitted without\nobjection (Gx. 1 - 12). Applicant testified and introduced one exhibit (Ax. A), which was admitted\nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 22, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe government alleged in SOR \u00b6 1 that Applicant was discharged of her debts through a\nChapter 7 bankruptcy petition in October 1999 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); she owes $8,051 for 15 unpaid debts\nconsisting of delinquent credit cards, an unpaid medical bill, unpaid telephone accounts, and a\nbounced check, between August 2000 and July 2006 (SOR  \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.m, 1.o - 1.q); and she owes\n$2,600 to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for an unpaid tax bill from May 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.n).\nApplicant admitted all of the allegations except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.j, and 1.n.

She was unemployed from\nDecember 2002 until December 2003, but received disability benefits until October 2003. Applicant\nworked as a customer service representative through all of 2002, but was on disability between July\n2001 and January 2002. Between August 1999 and July 2001, she was gainfully employed except\nfor the four-month period between November 2000 and March 2001, when she suffered an on-the-\njob injury and could not work.  \n2\n\n Gx. 2.\n3\n Tr., 52 - 53.\n4\n Tr., 47, 76.\n5\n Gx. 1.\n6\n Gx. 4; Tr., 45 - 47.\n7\n Gx. 7, Gx. 8.\n8\n Gx. 4, 5, 9, 10, 11.\n9\n Tr., 65 - 66.\n10\n Gx. 3.\n11\n4\nAfter being injured in a car accident, she was again out of work and on disability from March\n2006 until early June 2006, but did not return to full-time work until early July 2006.  Applicant was\n3\nalso on medical leave from September 2006 and January 2, 2007.  \n4\nApplicant has been married twice. She has two grown children from her first marriage, which\nbegan in 1973 and ended in divorce in 1989. She re-married in 1991, but she and her husband\nseparated in 1997. Their divorce was not finalized until June 2004.5\nFrom November 1988 until August 1999, Applicant ran her own child daycare business from\nher home.  Many of the children she cared for were either disabled or infants, sometimes prematurely\n6\nborn with drugs in their systems. In the last year of her business, Applicant could not keep up with\nall of the state regulatory and licensing requirements. The stress of trying to care for special needs\nchildren eventually proved too much, especially after her second husband left in 1997.  She\n7\nabandoned the business, her house, and most of her financial obligations related thereto, and filed\nfor a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in June 1999, declaring $157,626 in debts against $132,840 in\nassets. In October 1999, Applicant was discharged of her debts (SOR \u00b6 1.a).8\nBetween 1999 and 2006, Applicant incurred a variety of unpaid debts.  She is delinquent on\n9\nfive credit card accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h), five cell phone or telephone accounts\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.j, 1.k, 1.m, and 1.o), a medical account (SOR \u00b6 1.i), a bounced check (SOR \u00b61.e), and\ntwo other commercial accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p and 1.q). Applicant also owes the IRS $2,600 for unpaid\ntaxes (SOR \u00b6 1.n), but testified that she entered into a repayment plan in July 2005. She had to\nsuspend payment in March 2006, when she was out of work for medical reasons.10\nIn 2006, Applicant sought debt repayment help from a credit counseling service, but the\nmonthly payment they recommended was at least $200 more than she could afford. When a\ngovernment investigator interviewed Applicant during her background investigation in May 2005,\nApplicant submitted a personal financial statement (PFS) that showed she had a positive net monthly\ncash flow, excluding payments to any of the debts listed in the SOR, of $142.11\n\n Ax. A.\n12\n Directive, Enclosure 2.\n13\n A memorandum from Carol A. Haave, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence and\n14\nSecurity to DOHA Director, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases (Nov. 19, 2004), directed that adjudication of\ntrustworthiness cases for ADP I, II, and III positions be resolved using the provisions of the Directive rather than, as\noriginally drafted, DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, DoD Personnel Security Program, as amended (Regulation). Positions\ndesignated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions in section AP10.2.1 of the Regulation. ADP III\npositions are nonsensitive positions. (Regulation, AP102.3.1) By virtue of the aforementioned memorandum, however,\neven though they are nonsensitive positions, ADP III cases are treated in the same way and adjudicated under the same\nguidelines and procedures as ADP I and II cases.\n The November 19, 2004, memorandum did not specify whether the guidelines contained in the Directive or\n15\nthe Regulation should be used in ADP cases. Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth essentially the same adjudicative\npolicy, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions associated with each guideline, as is contained\nin Enclosure 2 of the Directive. DoD contractor personnel, such as this Applicant, are afforded the adjudication\nprocedures contained in the Directive. Because it appears Applicant was given along with the SOR the adjudicative\nmaterials from the Directive, I have referred to the factors contained in the Directive rather than the Regulation in\nreaching this decision.\n Directive, 6.3.\n16\n \u201cThe adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\n17\nconcept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\nconsidered in reaching a determination. In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should\nconsider the following factors:\n \nE2.2.1.1. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.2. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation;\n \nE2.2.1.3. The frequency and recency of the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.4. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.5. The voluntariness of participation;\n \nE2.2.1.6. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;\n \nE2.2.1.7. The motivation for the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.8. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n \nE2.2.1.9. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence;\u201d\n5\nApplicant enjoys her work. Between May 2005 and January 2006, she received numerous\npositive comments from customers about her helpfulness and expertise in handling their concerns\nand requests.12\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines  to be considered in evaluating an\n13\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access to sensitive information.  Each trustworthiness determination must\n14\nreflect consideration of both disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions  under each\n15\nadjudicative issue applicable to the facts and circumstances of each case. Each determination must\nalso reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of all available relevant and material\ninformation,  and it must reflect the adjudication process outlined in the Directive at Section\n16\nE2.2.1.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of\n17\na conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed\n\n Regulation, C6.1.1.1. \n18\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, at 528, 531(1988).\n19\n See Egan; Directive, E2.2.2.\n20\n Directive, E2.A6.1.1.\n21\n Directive, E2.A6.1.2.1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;\n22\n Directive, E2.A6.1.2.3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n23\n6\nwhenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant\nor denial of access to sensitive information.\nTrustworthiness determinations are intended solely to resolve whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the interests of national security  for an applicant to receive or continue to have access to\n18\nsensitive  information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information\non which it based the preliminary decision against the applicant. Additionally, the government must\nbe able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, the\nburden then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. As with\nsecurity clearances, no one has a \u201cright\u201d to such access.  Thus, an applicant bears a heavy burden\n19\nof persuasion. Access to sensitive information is a fiduciary relationship with the government based\non trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each\napplicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect\nsensitive information pertaining to the national interests as his or her own. Resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position should be resolved in\nfavor of the government.20\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations. Under Guideline F, an applicant who is financially overextended\nthrough delinquent debt and poor personal financial management may be at risk of engaging in\nillegal acts to generate funds to resolve her fiscal difficulties.  In 1999, Applicant received relief\n21\nthrough Chapter 7 bankruptcy from debts that went unpaid when she abandoned her business. Since\nthen, she has incurred at least 16 other delinquent debts, some as recent as 2006. Aside from entering\ninto a repayment agreement with the IRS to repay the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.n, she has not acted to\npay or otherwise resolve her obligations. Nor has Applicant shown she is fully informed about the\nfull extent of her indebtedness or is able to manage her finances so as to avoid additional unpaid\ndebts in the future. These facts warrant consideration of Guideline F disqualifying condition (DC)\n1  and DC 3.  \n22\n23\nBy contrast, available information shows over the past seven years Applicant has experienced\nseveral medical problems and other unforeseen events that could have caused her delinquent debts,\nbut certainly have hindered her ability to stay employed and repay some of them. Accordingly,\n\n Directive, E2.A6.1.3.3. The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control\n24\n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).\n See note 17, supra.\n25\n Directive, E2.2.3. \n26\n7\nGuideline F mitigating condition 3  must be considered. However, this is the only mitigating\n24\ncondition that applies. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are recent, they are not isolated, and Applicant\nhas not made a good-faith effort to repay or otherwise resolve her debts. Although she contacted a\ncredit counseling service, she did not follow through with their recommendations or pursue any other\norganized approach to her debts. The conditions still exist that have resulted in her poor financial\ncondition.\nAny benefit Applicant receives from MC 3 is attenuated by the fact her debts have arisen\neven when she was working. Based on all of the available information, it appears she is in debt\nprimarily because she does not manage her money in a prudent manner. The Directive allows for a\nbalancing of Applicant\u2019s poor financial health against the circumstances that have prevented her\nfrom resolving her debts. Nonetheless, even if the applicant is without fault in accruing the debt,\ncircumstances may still present an unacceptable risk to the government. On the facts presented here,\nit is probable Applicant would have neglected her finances even if she had not been ill, injured, or\nunemployed. I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F\npresented by available information about her finances.\nWhole Person. I have also considered the adjudicative process factors collectively referred\nto as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  A fair and commonsense assessment  of Applicant\u2019s financial\n25\n26\nproblems, taken in the context of all of the information before me shows that reasonable doubts\npersist about her ability to protect sensitive by exercising the requisite good judgment and discretion\nexpected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests. Absent substantial information to\nmitigate these doubts, which Applicant failed to provide, I cannot conclude she has otherwise\novercome the government\u2019s case.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst the Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a position of public trust.\nMatthew E.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation.  On August 30, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising\nApplicant of the basis for that decision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive\n\n2\n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided upon the\nwritten record.  On March 19, 2007, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Erin C.\nHogan denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant timely appealed\npursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ntrustworthiness determination under Guidelines F and E is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn her brief, Applicant discusses her financial situation and lists steps she has taken to\nimprove her financial situation and plans she has made for further financial improvement in the\nfuture.  To the extent that this information is new evidence, the Board cannot consider it on appeal.\nSee Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Applicant also repeats her explanation for her failure to list debts over 180\ndays past due.  She points out that she has performed her duties faithfully and without compromise\nfor two years and eight months.  \nPrior to the compilation of the File of Relevant Material, Applicant submitted information\nconcerning her financial situation and her failure to list her financial delinquencies.  This information\nwas part of the record evidence which was before the Judge when she reached a trustworthiness\ndetermination in Applicant\u2019s case.  There is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all\nthe record evidence, and in this case the Judge discussed the information Applicant provided and\nexplained why it was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.\nThe federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to\nproperly handle sensitive information before it can deny or revoke access to such information.  See\nAdams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  An\napplicant with good or exemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has negative\ntrustworthiness implications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0123 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2000).  The\nDirective's Guidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty conduct and circumstances which\nare of trustworthiness concern to the government and mandate a whole-person analysis to determine\nan applicant's trustworthiness eligibility.  A whole-person analysis is not confined to the workplace.\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-11231 at 3 (Jun. 4, 2004).\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the\nexercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-\n14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone\ncompel the Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness determination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge\nhas to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  Here, the Judge found some mitigation, but explained why it\nwas insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.  An applicant\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence\nor reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Applicant has not met her burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the financial considerations and personal conduct allegations had not been mitigated.  Although\n\n3\nApplicant strongly disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, she has not established that those\nconclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a history of not meeting financial obligations\nwhich extended over many years and had deliberately failed to disclose adverse information about\nher indebtedness on his Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF-85P).  At the time the case was\nsubmitted for decision, she still had significant outstanding debts.  In light of the foregoing, the\nJudge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.  The\nfavorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun.\n29, 2005).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of relevant\nmitigating conditions.  She reasonablyexplained why the evidence Applicant had presented in\nmitigation was insufficient to overcome  the government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.  The Board\ndoes not review a case de novo.   Given the record that was before her, the Judge\u2019s ultimate\nunfavorable trustworthiness determination under Guidelines F and E is sustainable.  Thus, the Judge\ndid not err in denying Applicant a trustworthiness designation.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a trustworthiness designation is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Michael Lyles, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is 49 years old, married with two college-age sons, and works for a defense\ncontractor.  She has family members in Taiwan.  Applicant mitigated the foreign influence security\nconcern.  Clearance is granted.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive).\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.  On December 8, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons1\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign\nInfluence) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.  Applicant answered the\nSOR in writing on December 15, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.\nThe case was assigned to me on May 9, 2007.  On June 5, 2007, I convened a hearing to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.  The Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence.\nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 21, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to all the SOR allegations are incorporated here as findings of fact.\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 49 years old, married, and has two sons in college.  Both children were born in\nthe U.S.  She and her husband came to the U.S. in 1985 from Taiwan to pursue additional education.\nHer husband obtained a Ph.D. in computer engineering in the U.S..  Applicant obtained bachelor\u2019s\nand master\u2019s degrees in Taiwan before she came to the U.S..  She worked in Taiwan for the Ministry\nof Justice as a probation officer from September 1983 to June 1985, and then immigrated to the U.S.\nApplicant obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science after she came to the U.S.  She has\nworked for the same employer for the past eight years.  Applicant is a database administrator for a\ngovernment contractor.  Her husband has been a college professor in computer engineering for 19\nyears.  She and her husband became naturalized U.S. citizens.  Her husband was naturalized on\nFebruary 20, 1997.  Applicant was naturalized on May 1, 1997.  They own their own home.\nApplicant was involved in her son\u2019s school activities when they were in elementary and high school.\n(Tr. 52, 77-88; Exhibits 1 and 2)\nApplicant obtained a U.S. passport in 1998 after she became a U.S. citizen.  The Taiwanese\npassport she had before she became a U.S. citizen expired October 23, 2001.  She turned in the\npassport while on a trip to Taiwan, and requested her name be stricken from that government\u2019s list\nof household  members in her family on Taiwan.  These actions she took on her own initiative to\nrenounce her Taiwanese citizenship in accordance with that country\u2019s procedures. (Tr. 67-70, 74;\nExhibits 2-6)\nApplicant\u2019s family are all living and working in Taiwan, except for her immediate family.\nThey are all citizens of Taiwan.  Applicant\u2019s father is a retired chief accountant for the Taiwan\nprovincial government.  Applicant has two brothers and four sisters in Taiwan.  Her oldest sister is\nan instructor and dormitory supervisor at a private college.  Her second oldest sister is dying from\n\n3\ncancer.  The third sister works as a cook for a local government.  The fourth sister is a housewife.\nOne brother is self-employed, installing various types of equipment in houses and apartments.\nApplicant has not talked to this brother in a long time.  The other brother is employed by a company\nowed by the Taiwanese government and by a private company.  Applicant sends emails to her\nparents inquiring about her sister\u2019s health, or telephones them about once a month.  She sends her\nparents small sums of money periodically to help them. (Tr. 71-76; Exhibits 1, 2, 6)\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are residents and citizens of Taiwan.  Her\nbrother-in-law works for the Taiwan Department of Water and Waste Management, and another is\nemployed by the Port Engineering Office.  Another brother-in-law works for a company partly\nowned by the Taiwanese Government.  Applicant\u2019s husband has a brother who lives in the U.S. and\nis a naturalized U.S. citizen. (Tr. 71-76; Exhibits 1, 2, 6, Answer)\nApplicant traveled to Taiwan in 1992, 1995, December 1998, December 2000, December\n2003, November 2005, and January 2007.  The last visit was to see her dying sister.  Applicant\nremained two weeks for that visit. (Tr. 84, 85; Exhibits 3-5, Answer)\nApplicant has four friends whom she visited when she went to her class reunion.  She does\nnot speak to them regularly.  She may send them periodic emails.  One friend works for a private\nconsultant.  Another works for the Ministry of Economics in Taiwan.  A third friend works in the\nTaipei (the capital city of Taiwan) as an assistant to a judge.  The fourth friend works as a clerk in\na high school in Taiwan. (Tr. 73; Exhibit 6, Answer)\nApplicant is well-regarded by her employers, the company security officer, and co-workers.\nThey consider her as having an excellent work ethic, being flexible in the workplace, competent, not\nable to be manipulated or intimidated, and gets along well with the other employees.  The company\nsecurity officer considers Applicant to be very conscientious and an employee who always turns in\npost-trip reports when she travels to Taiwan to visit her family. (Tr. 37-59) \nI take administrative notice of the island of Taiwan being the Republic of China, and not the\nPRC, which is located on the mainland of China.  The PRC regards itself as the legitimate\ngovernment of all of China, including Taiwan.  Since 1979, the U.S. has recognized the PRC as the\nlegal government of China under the \u201cone China\u201d policy, and does not have formal diplomatic\nrelations with Taiwan pursuant to the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979.  The U.S.  sells weapons to\nTaiwan and has trade relations with Taiwan.  Taiwan and the PRC engage in industrial and military\nespionage designed to collect proprietary and classified information.  The greater bulk of the\ninformation presented in the administrative notice documents pertains to the PRC activities in\nindustrial and military espionage.  Industrial espionage is intelligence gathering by a foreign country\nor a foreign company with its government\u2019s help against a private U.S. company to obtain\ncommercial secrets.  Taiwan collects primarily industrial information for commercial purposes.  The\nadministrative notice exhibit included two examples of Taiwan collecting, in one case, classified\ngovernment data, and in the other collecting commercial information to enable one of its\nmanufacturing companies to compete directly with a U.S. company.  The U.S. has formal diplomatic\nrelations with the PRC, but since 1979 has not had formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan.  The\nU.S. sells Taiwan military equipment and does billions of dollars of trade with Taiwan annually.\nIt also does billions of dollars of trade with the PRC annually.  Taiwan is a multi-party democracy\nof 22 million people, with an elected president and legislature.  The Taiwanese government does not\ncoerce its citizens, but is building a viable democracy based on its constitution, and does not have\n\n4\na history of human rights abuses.  On the other side of the Straits of Formosa is the PRC, a one-party\nauthoritarian government which has a long record of human rights abuses and espionage.  (Exhibit\n7)\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information with Industry\n\u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\nsecurity guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC)\nunder each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall common sense\ndetermination required.  \nIn evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also\nassess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nand the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  Because\neach security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that\nthe factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.\nMoreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an\nunfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a\nrecent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified\nin the Guidelines.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as\nto the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\n\n5\neligible for access to classified information.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  All that\nis required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling\nclassified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No.\n00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established\na prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  See Exec. Or. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline B:  The Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help\na foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can\nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial\ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country\nis known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with\na risk of terrorism. \u00b66\nCONCLUSIONS\nForeign Influence:  The condition that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying applicable here is \u00b67.a (contact with a foreign family member who is a citizen of or\nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion).\nApplicant has family members in Taiwan, consisting of her parents and siblings.  Brothers-\nin-law also live and work on Taiwan.  Their jobs for the Taiwan governments are all low-level\npositions.  Her father had an accountant\u2019s position from which he retired.  She visits her family\nabout every three years.  Her latest visit was in January 2007, to visit her cancer-stricken sister.  She\nspeaks with her parents monthly.\nAfter the Government raised a disqualification, the burden shifted to Applicant to mitigate\nor rebut the allegations.  Two mitigating conditions apply: \u00b68.a (the nature of the relationships with\nforeign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of\nhaving to choose between the interests of the foreign individual and the interests of the U.S.), and\n\u00b68.b (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to\nthe foreign person is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and\n\n6\nloyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor\nof the U.S. interests).  Applicant has only familial relations with her family, not business relations.\nTaiwan engages in industrial espionage, but it is a parliamentary democracy under a constitution.\nHer relatives, including her in-laws, work for private companies or government agencies, but not\nin policy making or espionage/intelligence positions.  They have low-level positions, including\nclerical and cooking.  The same type of positions are held by her personal friends in Taiwan.\nTherefore, there is unlikely she will be placed in a position of having to choose between those\npersons she knows on Taiwan and the interests of the U.S. \nThere is no conflict of interest in Applicant\u2019s situation because of her deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties to the U.S.  There are many positive attributes to Applicant\u2019s life as a\nU.S. citizen that weigh in favor of granting her a security clearance. She has extensive and long-term\ncontacts with the U.S.  She has lived here since 1985, obtained a college degree here, and been a\ncitizen since 1997.  Her husband also became a U.S. citizen in 1997, and has been employed by the\nsame university for 19 years as a professor.  She has worked for the same employer for eight years.\nShe owns a home in the U.S., and has no property or financial interests in any other country.  Her\nsons were born in the U.S., and she is very dedicated to them and active in their education.  She is\na loyal American committed to her family and job in the U.S., and would resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S.  After every trip to Taiwan, she filed trip reports with her company\nsecurity officer disclosing her activity on those trips.  On one trip she took the initiative to renounce\nher Taiwanese citizenship and remove herself from that government\u2019s list of citizens and her family\nmembers.  I give her history in the U.S. and her compliance with company security requirements\ngreat weight.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201cEach\nsecurity clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3. \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). In\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the AG \u00b6\n2(a).  However, because foreign influence does not involve misconduct, only the eighth factor (the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress) is relevant.\nApplicant\u2019s history of living and working in the U.S., and her dedication to her immediate\nfamily in the U.S. is significant.  It is contrasted with the periodic schedule of visits to Taiwan, and\nlack of regular and consistent contact in the interim with any family members other than her parents.\nAll these factors show that there is no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress upon\nApplicant.  I give great weight to the testimony from her co-workers, security officer, and supervisor\nabout her work ethic over the past eight years, and dedication to her job and security requirements.\nI also conclude Applicant is credible in her explanations of her familial relationships and strong\npreference for the U.S.\nIn addition to the above facts, security determinations are predictive judgments and the best\npredictor of future performance is past performance.  Based on a review of her history and\n\n7\nsubstantial ties to the United States, I conclude Applicant\u2019s potential for exploitation by Taiwan, a\ndemocratic ally of the United States, appears low and unlikely to occur.\nTherefore, I conclude the foreign influence security concern for Applicant.  I also conclude\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

His mother has resided in the U.S. for 34 years but\nremains a citizen of the Republic of Korea (ROK).  His wife is a citizen of the ROK residing with\nhim in the U.S.  His grandmother, mother-in-law, father-in-law, and brother-in-law are all citizens\nand residents of the ROK.  He has mitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence.\nClearance is granted.  \n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 6, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a security\nclearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as\namended and modified (Directive).  The SOR alleged security concerns raised under Guideline B\n(Foreign Influence) of the Directive. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 20, 2006.  He initially elected to have the\ncase decided on the record in lieu of a hearing before an administrative judge.  Department Counsel\nsent the File of Relevant Material to Applicant on August 23, 2006.  On November 1, 2006,\nApplicant changed his election and requested a hearing.  Scheduling the hearing was delayed because\nApplicant had been ordered to active duty in the U.S. Army Reserve and deployed to Iraq. The case\nwas assigned to an administrative judge on January 25, 2007.  The case was scheduled for April 27,\n2007, and the hearing convened on that date; but the administrative judge granted a continuance until\nApril 30, 2007, because of the unavailability of Applicant\u2019s counsel.  The case was reassigned to me\non April 27, 2007, and heard on April 30, 2007, as rescheduled.  DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript (Tr.) of the April 27 hearing on May 4, 2007, and the transcript of the April 30 hearing on\nMay 9, 2007.  All citations to the transcript in the decision below refer to the transcript of the April\n30 hearing.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 29-year-old analyst employed by a federal contractor since May 2004.  He is\na U.S. citizen by virtue of his father\u2019s citizenship and his birth in the U.S.  His mother is a citizen\nof the ROK residing permanently in the U.S.  He graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in May\n1999 and served for five years on active duty, including tours of duty in Afghanistan and the ROK.\nHe transferred to the U.S. Army Reserve upon his release from active duty, and he was recalled to\nactive duty in April 2006 and deployed to Iraq in September 2006 (Tr. 51).  He has held a security\nclearance continuously since 1997 (Tr. 57).\nWhile on active duty and assigned to the ROK, he met his future wife, a citizen of the ROK.\nThey were married in the ROK on September 3, 2002.  They have two children, a two-year-old and\na three-month-old (Tr. 68).  They chose to be married in the ROK to make it easier for Applicant\u2019s\nextended Korean family and his wife\u2019s family to attend the ceremony (Tr. 56). Applicant\u2019s\nimmediate family came to the ROK from the U.S. to attend the ceremony.  His wife accompanied\nhim when he was reassigned to the U.S. in March 2003, and now resides with him in the U.S.  They\ndo not have any assets, sources of income, or business connections in the ROK (Tr. 68-69).\n\nMorale, welfare, and recreation activities are U.S. instrumentalities, but they are self-supporting and do not\n1\nreceive appropriated funds.\n4\nApplicant\u2019s wife was working for a morale, welfare, and recreation activity for the U.S.\nForces in Korea when Applicant met her.   She graduated from college in the ROK with a major in\n1\nEnglish education (Tr. 54).  Her employment by a U.S. agency required that she undergo a\nbackground  investigation.  When Applicant requested and obtained permission to marry a foreign\nnational, his intended wife was required to undergo another background investigation (Tr. 55).  His\nwife is not employed outside the home (Tr. 73).\nApplicant\u2019s mother married a U.S. soldier and came to the U.S. in 1974.  Her first husband,\nApplicant\u2019s father, died when Applicant was three years old (Tr. 48, 50).  She has since married\nanother U.S. citizen. She is a housewife (Tr. 50).  According to Applicant, she never applied for U.S.\ncitizenship because she was busy raising her children, but she considers herself \u201cmore American than\nnot\u201d (Tr. 85).  She visits the ROK every two or three years (Tr. 83).\nApplicant\u2019s grandmother is a citizen and resident of the ROK, but she spends about half the\ntime in the U.S. with her family (Tr. 81).  She is more than 80 years old.  She is a housewife and\nlives on her own assets.  She does not depend on any benefits from the ROK government  and has\nnever had any ties to the ROK government or military.  Applicant visited her often when he was\nstationed in the ROK.  Now he calls her twice a year.  Applicant\u2019s wife calls her about every ten days\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law, father-in-law, and brother-in-law are citizens and residents of the\nROK.  None of his in-laws are politically active, connected with the ROK government or military,\nor dependent on the ROK government for any benefits (AX A-D).  \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law was a homemaker for most of her life, but she is now working in\nreal estate (Tr. 78).  Applicant writes to her twice a year and calls about four times a year.  His wife\nwrites about four times a year and calls her every week (AX B).\nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law worked as an architect until he was injured in a car accident about\nten years ago.  After he was injured, he stopped working (Tr. 78).  Applicant calls him about once\na month, and Applicant\u2019s wife calls him once a week (AX C).\nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law works as a commercial truck driver (Tr. 79).  He performed his\nmandatory military service in the ROK armed forces, but he has no other connection with the ROK\ngovernment or military. Applicant calls him once or twice a year and Applicant\u2019s wife calls four or\nfive times a year.  (AX D.)\nThe ROK is a highly developed, stable, democratic republic, with a generally good human\nrights record.  While some human rights violations have occurred, they have not included\nmistreatment of suspects, police abuse of persons in custody, or torture and coercion of citizens by\ngovernment officials.  The United States maintains a strong military presence in the ROK, especially\nalong the demilitarized zone between the ROK and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea\n(DPRK).  While military tension continues between the ROK and DPRK, they have moved forward\n\nAt Department Counsel\u2019s request, I took administrative notice of adjudicative facts concerning the ROK, based\n2\non Hearing Exhibit (HX) III (U.S. Dept. of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, Republic of Korea (Mar.\n8, 2006) and HX IV (U.S. Dept. of State, Background Note: South Korea (Apr. 2006).  I declined to take administrative\nnotice based on HX I (National Counterintelligence Center, Report to Congress, 2000) based on the age of the\npublication and its dubious relevance in light of its reference only to \u201cKorea\u201d without specifying either the ROK or the\nDPRK.  I also declined to take administrative notice based on HX II (Larry A. Niksch, Congressional Research Service,\nKorea: U.S.-Korean Relations -- Issues for Congress (Jun. 16, 2005), because Department Counsel was unable to\ndemonstrate that the opinions expressed by the author were accepted by the U.S. government as facts not subject to\nreasonable dispute.  However, I admitted HX II as a learned treatise and redesignated it as GX 2.\n5\non a number of economic cooperative projects, which are sometimes at odds with U.S. policy.  The\nROK is the seventh largest U.S. trading partner and the 11th largest economy in the world.2\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to\nclassified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC)\nfor each guideline.  Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision\nbased on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 6.3.1 through 6.3.6.\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security\nsuitability.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-\n1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).  \n\n6\nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3; see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case\nNo. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe concern under this guideline is that a security risk may exist when an applicant\u2019s\nimmediate family, or other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or\nobligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress.  \u201cThese situations could create\nthe potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.A2.1.1.  A disqualifying condition (DC 1) may arise when \u201c[a]n immediate family\nmember [spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters], or a person to whom the\nindividual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign\ncountry.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.2.1.   \u201c[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of\naffection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person\u2019s spouse.\u201d  ISCR Case\nNo. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).  The totality of an applicant\u2019s\nfamily ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered.  ISCR Case\nNo. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). \nA disqualifying condition (DC 2) also may arise when an applicant is \u201c[s]haring living\nquarters with a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the potential for adverse\nforeign influence or duress exists.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.2.2.  Where the cohabitant is also an\nimmediate family member under DC 1, both disqualifying conditions may apply.  The evidence in\nthis case is sufficient to raise both DC 1 and DC 2.\nFamily ties with persons in a foreign country are not, as a matter of law, automatically\ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However,  such ties raise a prima facie security concern sufficient\nto require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet\nthe applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for the applicant.  See Directive\u00b6 E3.1.15; ISCR Case No. 99-0424,\n2001 DOHA LEXIS 59 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to establish DC 1, the burden shifted\nto Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of\ndisproving it is never shifted to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep.\n22, 2005).  \nIn cases where an applicant has immediate family members who are citizens or residents of\na foreign country, a mitigating condition (MC 1) may apply if \u201cthe immediate family members,\ncohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be\n\n7\nexploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to\nthe person(s) involved and the United States.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.1.  Notwithstanding the facially\ndisjunctive language of MC 1(\u201cagents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited\u201d), it\nrequires proof \u201cthat an applicant\u2019s family members, cohabitant, or associates in question are (a) not\nagents of a foreign power, and (b) not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that\ncould force the applicant to chose between the person(s) involved and the United States.\u201d  ISCR\nCase No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004).\nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United States has\na compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person,\norganization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person,\norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-\n11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  Although the ROK historically has been regarded as friendly\nto the U.S., the distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with\ncaution.  Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over\nmatters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly\nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific,\nand technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd.\nMar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S.,\nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family\nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is\nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is\nassociated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence\noperations against the U.S.\nNone of Applicant\u2019s family members are agents of a foreign power, connected to a foreign\ngovernment or its military services, politically active, or dependent on the ROK government for any\nbenefits.  None of them are involved in businesses likely to be involved in economic or industrial\nespionage.  While these individual family circumstances are not determinative,  Applicant\u2019s evidence\ndemonstrating his family\u2019s absence of governmental connections, financial dependence on the\ngovernment, or business connections susceptible to industrial espionage is relevant in assessing\nwhether MC 1 applies. The nature of the ROK\u2019s government, its human rights record, and its\nrelationship with the U.S. also are not determinative, but they are all relevant factors in determining\nwhether the ROK would risk damaging its relationship with the U.S. by exploiting or threatening its\nprivate citizens in order to force a U.S. citizen to betray the U.S.  After considering the totality of\nApplicant\u2019s family ties to the ROK as well as each individual family tie, I conclude MC 1 is\nestablished.\nA mitigating condition (MC 3) may apply if \u201c[c]ontact and correspondence with foreign\ncitizens are casual and infrequent.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.3.  at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002).\nApplicant has no immediate family members in the ROK, but he maintains regular contact with his\ngrandmother, mother-in-law, father-in-law, and brother-in-law.  I conclude MC 3 is not established.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\n8\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered the general adjudicative guidelines in the Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.  I have\nconsidered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding\nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation;\n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E2.2.1.1 through E2.2.1.9.  Some of these\nfactors were discussed above, but some merit additional comment.\nApplicant is a mature adult who spent five years on active duty as an Army officer, and he\nhas been recalled for service in Iraq.  His grandmother remains a resident of the ROK, but she spends\nhalf her time in the U.S.  His mother has never bothered to become a U.S. citizen, but she has lived\nin the U.S. for 32 years, had two American husbands, raised a loyal soldier-son, and clearly is an\nAmerican at heart.  Under the revised adjudicative guidelines implemented by the Department of\nDefense for cases where the SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006 (Guidelines), a\nmitigating condition may be established by showing \u201cthe individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 8(b). While Applicant\u2019s case is not covered by\nthe revised guidelines, the strength and depth of his commitment to the U.S. and his family ties in\nthe U.S. are relevant considerations under the whole-person concept.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines B, and\nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated\nthe security concerns based on foreign influence.  Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden\nof showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue his security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  Clearance is granted.\n\n9\nLeRoy F. Foreman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The Applicant also visited China on one\noccasion in 1999, on behalf of his U.S. company.  His family connections, a spouse, two children,\nand a sister, are in the U.S.  His financial interests are also in the U.S.  Those who know and work\nwith the Applicant think highly of him.  As the Applicant has \u201clongstanding relationships and\nloyalties in the U.S.,\u201d it is unlikely that he \u201cwill be placed in a position of having to choose between\nthe interests of . . . [his brother] . . . and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  Mitigation is shown.  Clearance\nis granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 23, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on November 13, 2006.\nThe case was received by the undersigned on January 10, 2007.  A notice of hearing was\nissued on January 19, 2007, and the case was heard on February 7, 2007.  The Government submitted\ndocumentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted documentary\nevidence.  The transcript (TR) was received on February 16, 2007.  The issues raised here are\nwhether the Applicant's alleged Foreign Influence militates against the granting of a security\nclearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis of the three allegations.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 54 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review\nof the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following\nadditional Findings of Fact.\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nThe Applicant\u2019s family fled China in 1949 to escape the Communists (TR at page 16 lines\n7~20).  He was born in Taiwan in 1952, but immigrated to the U.S. in 1986, more than 20 years ago\n(TR at page 1~23).  The Applicant\u2019s spouse, two children, and a sister are all Americans, and live\nin the U.S. (TR at page 17 lines 13~18, and at page 24 lines 1~23).  The Applicant\u2019s financial\ninterests are all in the U.S. (TR at page 25 lines 3~20).\n\n3\n1.a. and 1.b.  The Applicant\u2019s 80 year old brother is a citizen of and resides in Taiwan (TR\nat page 17 line 24 to page 18 line 4).  His brother retired from the Taiwanese navy as a Captain\n25~30 years ago (TR at page 18 line 4 to page 19 line 3).  Their relationship is not close, as the\nApplicant\u2019s brother is 26 years older than the Applicant (TR at page 20 lines 7~17).  The Applicant\nvisited Taiwan, twice in 2003, three times in 2004, twice in 2005, and once in 2006 (Answer).  He\nonly visits his brother occasionally, when he is in Taiwan (TR at page 19 line 14 to page 20 line 6).\n1.c.  The Applicant also visited China on one occasion in 1999, on behalf of his U.S.\ncompany (TR at page 27 line 4 to page 28 line 1).  He has no intention on visiting China other than\non business (Id).\nTaiwan has an elected democratic government.  It has the 17  largest economy in the world\nth\nthat is a leading producer of high-technology goods.  It engages in industrial and economic\nespionage.  Proprietary information technology is high on the Taiwanese list of targeted information\nto be acquired by their agents from foreign governments and business.  Although the U.S. now\nrecognizes Taiwan as part of China as \u201cone-China,\u201d it continues to maintain strong unofficial\nrelations with Taiwan.\nChina, on the other hand, is run by the Communist Party, which controls all aspects of the\nChinese government.  China engages in espionage against the U.S. through an extensive network of\nbusinesses, personnel, and specific programs designed to acquire advanced U.S. military technology.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\n \nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\u201d\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\n\n4\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence that is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (Foreign Influence); which\nestablishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational\nconnection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to\neffectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational\nconnection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who is subject to Foreign Influence, may be prone to provide information or\nmake decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  The Government must be able\nto place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and\nregulations at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Applicant's elderly brother is citizen of and resides in Taiwan.  He also has occasional\ncontact with this brother.  The first and second disqualifying conditions are arguably applicable as\nthis contact \u201ccreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion,\" and creates \u201ca potential conflict of interests between the individual\u2019s obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . .\n. by providing that information.\u201d  Under the facts of this particular case, however, these are clearly\ncountered by the first and second mitigating conditions.  The nature of the Applicant\u2019s relationship\nwith his brother in Taiwan is \u201csuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of\nhaving to choose between the interests of . . . [his brother] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  Also, the\nApplicant \u201chas such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d\nFurthermore, I am not limited to the mitigating conditions, delineated in the Directive, in\ndeciding if an Applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation.  Here, those who know the\nApplicant best, speak most highly of his character, credibility and trustworthiness (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit A).  The totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, as set forth at length above,\nclearly warrants a favorable recommendation under the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  Mitigation is\nshown.  Guideline B is thus found for the Applicant.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his\nForeign Influence.  The Applicant has thus met the mitigating conditions of Guideline B, and of\nSection E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under\nGuideline B.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n5\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Financial\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na.   For the Applicant.\nb.   For the Applicant.\nc.   For the Applicant.\nFactual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in FINDINGS OF FACT and\nCONCLUSIONS, supra.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nRichard A.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 25, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\n\n2\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 29, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Mary E. Henry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nfiled a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nThe Judge found that Applicant was first arrested for Driving While Intoxicated when he was\n16 years old and in high school.  Applicant was convicted and sentenced to community service.  He\nlost his license for one year and had to attend alcohol education classes.\nThe Judge also found that in May 2004 Applicant and his girlfriend, following dinner and\ndrinks at a local restaurant, got into a dispute with the staff over whether he had paid the bill,\nApplicant insisting that he had.  The staff called the police.  \u201cBecause he was upset about the\naccusation and the decision to call the police, he couldn\u2019t keep his mouth shut.  As a result, the\npolice arrested him for disorderly conduct in a motor vehicle.\u201d  Applicant ultimately paid a fine.\nIn December 2005, Applicant and his fianc\u00e9 attended a Christmas party, during which they\nconsumed alcohol over several hours.  After leaving the party, they went to a bar, where they got into\nan argument.  During the trip home, they continued the argument, Applicant eventually stopping the\ncar, pulling his fianc\u00e9 out, and leaving her behind.  Applicant was charged with criminal domestic\nviolence.  Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9 did not appear at trial, so the charges were dismissed.\nIn August 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence.  Trial\nwas delayed until some time after the hearing in Applicant\u2019 security clearance case.  Following this\narrest, Applicant received outpatient substance abuse treatment.\nIn his appeal submission, Applicant contends that the Judge gave undue weight to the phrase\n\u201ccouldn\u2019t keep his mouth shut.\u201d  Applicant believes that the entire incident arising out of the dispute\nin the restaurant was blown out of proportion.  He contends that the Judge\u2019s findings are in error to\nthe extent that they attribute the August 2005 incident to alcohol consumption.  We also construe\nApplicant\u2019s brief as asserting that the Judge did not properly apply the whole-person factors in\narriving at her decision.\nWe have examined the Judge\u2019s findings in light of the record and conclude that those\nfindings are sustainable.  Furthermore, the record does not support a conclusion that the Judge\nweighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 05-04923 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 24, 2007).   Neither does the record support a conclusion that the\nJudge erred in her whole-person analysis.  See Directive \u00b6 E2.1.2.  The whole person analysis\nsupports the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion denying Applicant a security clearance.  See ISCR Case No.\n04-11414 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 5, 2007).\n\n3\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E. Smallin             \nJean E.

He has\nmitigated the concerns under the personal conduct and drug involvement guidelines through\nrehabilitation and the passage of time. He was born in Iran. He failed to mitigate security concerns\narising from foreign influence due to his contact with family members who are residents and citizens\nof Iran.

The SOR, which is in essence\n1\nthe administrative complaint, alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline B (Foreign\nInfluence), Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department\nof Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when\nthe SOR was issued.\nThe case was assigned to me on February 27, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on March\n14, 2007, scheduling the hearing for March 28, 2007. Applicant waived the 15-day notice\nrequirement. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted two exhibits that\nwere marked as Government Exhibit (GE) 1-2. Applicant did not submit any exhibits at the hearing,\nbut was allowed time to send a post-hearing submission. The Applicant's eight exhibits (post\nhearing) marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A through H, and entered into the record without\nobjection. Counsel submitted background notes and State Department documents on Iran, which\nwere marked as Hearing Exhibit 1. Applicant testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the\nhearing transcript (TR) on April 11, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations pertaining to foreign influence under Guideline\nB (subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d), personal conduct under Guideline E (subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b)\nand drug involvement under Guideline H (subparagraphs 3.a through 3.c). Those admissions are\nincorporated as findings of fact. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and\nexhibits, I make the following findings of fact:\nSince March 2003, Applicant who is 47 years old, has worked as a pharmacist for a defense\ncontractor. He was born and raised in Iran; however, he has lived in the United States (U.S.) for\nthirty years as a naturalized citizen. He received his undergraduate degree in the U.S. in 1988.  After\n2\ngraduation, he passed the state board exam for his pharmacy license.  He has worked as a pharmacist\n3\nfor the past 20 years. He submitted a trustworthiness application on February 26, 2004.4\nWhile in the U. S., Applicant progressed in his chosen career. He worked in a hospital setting\nas a Director of Pharmacy, but decided to leave the hospital setting for the corporate world, and\n\nTr. 28.\n5\nTr. 56.\n6\nTr. 29.\n7\nTr.42.\n8\nAE E (Letter of Compliance from State Board, dated March 30, 2007) at 1.\n9\nAE G (Consent Agreement, dated March 1, 2003) at 1-4; Tr. 50.\n10\nAE D (Letter of Reference from defense contract employer, dated March 30, 2007) at 1.\n11\nTr.79.\n12\n4\nworked for a large pharmacy.  After several years, approximately 1999, Applicant started taking\n5\nnarcotics from the pharmacy inventory.  He tested positive for the prescription drug Darvocet (a mild\n6\nsedative).  He used schedule two drugs approximately 2 or 3 times a week. Then he stole schedule\n7\n3 drugs from his stock at work. As a result, his employer fired him for stealing prescription drugs\nin 2001.  He paid $300 in restitution.\n8\nApplicant signed a Consent Agreement with the State Board on March 26, 2001. This\ncontract required him to complete outpatient rehabilitation, attend three self-help meetings per week,\nsubmit 24 random urine screens per year and attend weekly peer group counseling sessions. The\nprogram was approved by the state licensing board.9\nOn June 25, 2001, Applicant refused a random urine screen because he was using\nhydrocodone without a prescription in violation of his Consent Agreement. He admitted himself to\nan inpatient treatment center on June 30, 2001. At that time, he signed a new agreement that again\nrequired him to complete treatment, attend weekly group counseling sessions and self-help meetings.\nOn July 27, 2001, Applicant completed his inpatient treatment program. In November, 2001, the\nBoard allowed Applicant to reinstate his pharmacy license with the stipulation that he practice under\nthe supervision of a licensed pharmacist.\nApplicant relapsed in 2002. He was using a nonprescribed medication, and as a result, his\nlicense as a pharmacist was again put on probation. On February 10, 2003, Applicant reported\npositive for propoxyphene. He appeared before the Board of Licensing Examiners and signed a new\ncontract on April 16, 2003. This legally binding contract requires him to attend 90 self-help meetings\nin 90 days, Relapse Prevention Treatment, attend weekly peer group counseling sessions and attend\n3 self-help meetings per week and submit 24 random urine screens per year. This consent agreement\nis valid until 2008. 10\nApplicant is not allowed to work in a retail pharmacy setting under the 2003 agreement. He\nworks for the defense contractor where there is no access to medications. He has one more year in\nthe program. He enjoys his work and is praised for his exemplary adherence to the standard of the\nprofession.  He remains drug free and abides by the program guidelines. He actively participates in\n11\ngroup therapy. He has a sponsor in his 12 step program.  He wishes to remain in a setting that has\n12\n\nTr.52.\n13\nTr. 61.\n14\nTr. 63.\n15\nTr. 87.\n16\nTr.132-133.\n17\nAE B (Petition for Alien Relative, Department of Homeland Security, dated September 18, 2005) at 1-2.\n18\nAE C (Letter from National Visa Center, dated June 30, 2006) at 1-3.\n19\nApplicant's memorandum, dated September 2006, at 1.\n20\n5\nnothing to do with the dispensing of medications. He finds his current employment rewarding and\nless stressful.13\nApplicant's use of the non-prescribed medications partially relates to his marital problems.\nHe does not minimize his actions, but was depressed for a period of time, and did not know how to\ncope. He worked long hours and cared for his family. He admits experimenting to gain a sense of\ncalm. The medications were taken from the stock bottle on the shelf. At one point, he took a pain pill\nevery three or four hours.  However, he reports this was not a routine.  He now has the tools to deal\n14\n15\nwith his problems. He currently takes prescribed medication for depression.16\nApplicant's mother is a citizen and resident of Iran. His father divorced his mother when\nApplicant was nine months old, and he was not allowed to see his mother. His wife, who he married\nin Cyprus in 1990, lives with him in the U.S. She was born in England but her parents are from Iran.\nApplicant has two sons who were born in the U.S. He has not spoken to his mother in 17 years. The\nonly time he saw her after his parents' divorce was his wedding in Cyprus. He does not have any\ncontact with his father. However, he telephones his aunt in Iran once a month. She is almost 70 years\nold and is a homemaker. Applicant reports that she is his only family.  \n17\nHis wife speaks to her mother in Iran. They are trying to bring her to the U.S. as a permanent\nresident. Applicant  filed a Petition for his mother-in-law with the Department of Homeland Security\nin 2005.  They received a letter from the National Visa Center in 2006, requesting more information\n18\nfor his mother-in-law's immigrant visa.  Applicant's father-in-law is deceased.\n19\nApplicant has one brother-in-law in Iran. His wife speaks to her brother, who owns a private\nbusiness, three or four times a year. His wife traveled to Iran approximately 10 years ago to visit her\nfamily. Applicant has never returned to Iran, and he does not wish to return to Iran. He values his\nlife in the U. S. and his ability to provide for his family.\nApplicant loves his job. He considers himself loyal to the U. S. He denies that he has a\npreference for Iran to the United States. He enjoys working and living in the U. S. He considers\nhimself a good citizen.20\n\nBackground Note at 8; U.S. Department of State, Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, Country\n21\nReports on Terrorism -2005, dated April 2006, (Reports on Terrorism) at 21.\nReports on Terrorism at 171 and 173.\n22\nId. at 171.\n23\nId. at 173.\n24\nId.\n25\n6\nThe U.S. Government's concerns with Iran's policies are: (1) its clandestine efforts to acquire\nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction (WMD), (2) its sponsorship of international\nterrorism, (3) its intervention into the internal affairs of Iraq, (4) its aggressive efforts to undermine\nthe Middle East peace process, and (5) it human rights violations against its own people.21\nThe U.S. designates Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism, one of a half-dozen countries, and\ncharacterizes it as \"the most active state sponsor.\"  As a state sponsor of terrorism, Iran provides\n22\ncritical support to non-state terrorist groups.  Iran regularly provides \"unique safe haven, substantial\n23\nresources and guidance to terrorists organizations.\"  As a state sponsor of terrorism with nuclear\n24\nambitions, Iran poses a \"grave WMD terrorism threat.\"  Iran supports terrorist activity against the\n25\nU.S. forces in Iraq.\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \"the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position ....\nthat will give that person access to such information.\"  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch.\nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive. The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on\nthe relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the\nadjudicative process factors listed in paragraph 6.3 of the Directive and AG paragraph 2(a). \nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\"whole person concept,\" all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. The Adjudicative\nProcess factors which an administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individuals's  age and maturity\nat the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\n\nThe Directive, as amended by Change 4, dated April 20, 1999, uses 'clearly consistent with the national\n26\ninterest\" (Sec. 2.3; Sec.2.5.3; Sec 3.2.; and Sec. 4.2.; Enclosure 3, Sec. E3.1.1.; Sec. E3.1.2.; Sec. E3.1.2.5.; Sec.\nE3.1.2.6.; and Sec. E3.1.2.7.), \"clearly consistent with the interests of national security\" (Enclosure 2, Sec. E2.2.3.); and\n\"clearly consistent with national security\" (Enclosure 2, Sec. E2.2.2.).\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at 2.\n27\n7\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced\nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S.\ninterests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under\nthis Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited, to such considerations as\nwhether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement: Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can\nraise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair\njudgement and because it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with\nlaws, rules, and regulations.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the trustworthiness\neligibility is \"clearly consistent with the interests of national security\" or \"clearly consistent with the\nnational interest.\"  For the purposes herein, despite the different wording in each, I have concluded\n26\nall of the standards are the same. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that\nare reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided\ndrawing inferences that are grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the\ngovernment to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to sensitive\ninformation.  If the government meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the\n27\napplicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to\n\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Para E3.1.15.\n28\nDirective, Enclosure 2, Para. E2.2.2\n29\n8\novercome the doubts raised by the government\u2019s case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant\u2019s eligibility.28\nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. Because of this special relationship, the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom\nit grants access to sensitive information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect\nor safeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. Any\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of national security.29\nOne additional comment is worthy of note. Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are\nnot at issue in these proceedings. Section 7 of the Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that\nindustrial security clearance decisions shall be, \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Trustworthiness determination\ndecisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.\nNothing in this decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part,\non any express or implied decision as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in\nthe SOR. \nForeign Influence\nApplicant's mother, mother-in-law, aunt, and brother-in-law are residents and citizens of Iran.\nThis raises a security concern, under Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) AG \u00b6 7 (a)\ncontact with a foreign family member, business, or professional associate, friend, or other person\nwho is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion.\nWhen the Government's initial burden has been met and a disqualifying condition raised, the\nburden shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation, or mitigation,\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case. \nAlthough one of Applicant's relatives (his mother-in-law) is in the process of emigrating to\nthe U. S. and he has no contact with his mother or father, the group of relatives are considered as a\n\nSee e.g. ISCR case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. July 17, 2006) (noting security concerns because applicant's\n30\nbrother and mother in-law live in Iran).\nISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006)(\"[FI MC ] 1 does not apply because, as is well settled,\n31\nit requires that Applicant demonstrate that his relatives are not in a position which could force Applicant to choose\nbetween his loyalty to them and his loyalty to the United States.\") ISCR Case.

Even if only one relative lives in Iran, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for\n30\nforeign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR\nCase. No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006). The mere possession of close family ties with a\nperson in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. ISCR Case No.\n99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). However, such ties do raise a security concern under FI DC 7 (a)\nand Applicant is required to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet\nhis burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for him. Id.\nSecurity concerns based on foreign influence can be mitigated by showing that any of the six\nforeign influence mitigating conditions (FI MC) exist. FI MC AG \u00b6 8(a) recognizes that security\nconcerns are reduced when the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely\nthe individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S. The Appeal Board has\ndecided that Applicant must prove that his family members, cohabitant or associates are not in a\nposition to be exploited in a way that could force Applicant to choose between the person(s) involved\nand the U.S. ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. July 26, 2004).\nThe Appeal Board has also interpreted language in the mitigating condition as an absolute\nstandard; i.e., an applicant must affirmatively prove that there is no possibility that anyone might\nattempt to exploit or influence a foreign relative or acquaintance in the future.31\nThis mitigating condition focuses on a very specific type of threat - the risk of a foreign entity\nexploiting an applicant's foreign relatives in such a way as to cause an applicant to act adversely to\nthe U. S. The Appeal Board has limited the applicability of FI MC 1 where there is a history of\nterrorist activity in the foreign country in question.32\nApplicant's mother, mother-in-law, aunt, and brother-in-law are citizens of Iran, but they do\nnot work for the government of Iran. The evidence does not establish that his family members living\nin Iran are in any way associated with the government. \nThe nature of a nation's government, its relationship with the United States, and its human\nrights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant's family members are vulnerable\nto government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion or duress is significantly greater if the\nforeign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is dependent upon the government,\nor the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. The hostility of\nIran to the United States places a \"very heavy burden of persuasion\" on Applicant to demonstrate that\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006).\n33\nSee ISCR Case. No. 04-09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006).\n34\n10\nhis immediate family members in Iran do not pose security risk and he is not in a position to choose\nbetween loyalty to the United Sates and his family members.  With its adversarial stance and its\n33\ndismal human rights record, it is conceivable that Iran would target any citizen in an attempt to gather\ninformation from the United States.\nThere is no evidence that his mother, mother-in-law, aunt, or brother-in-law are or have been,\npolitical activists, challenging the policies of the Iranian government. Likewise, there is no evidence\nthat these relatives work for the Iranian government or military. There is no evidence that the Iranian\ngovernment has approached any of his Iranian family for any reason, nor is there evidence that his\nfamily living in Iran engages in activities that would bring attention to themselves or that they are\neven aware of his work. As such there is a reduced possibility that they would be targets for coercion\nor exploitation by the Iranian government, which regularly seeks to quiet those who speak out against\nit. Applicant deserves some credit because of the reduced possibility that Iran will exploit his family,\nbut this mitigating condition cannot be applied in this case because even if there was substantial\nevidence of the family members' low-key noncontroversial lifestyle, and the fact that the Iranian\ngovernment has not contacted them about Applicant in the past, such factors are insufficient to\nsupport the application \"because of the nature of the Iranian government and its relationship to the\nUnited States.\" See n.33, infra (explaining that absence of evidence does not shift burden to\ngovernment to prove anything in security clearance cases).\nFI MC AG \u00b6 8 (b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest applies because\nApplicant has been in the U. S. for 30 years. His wife and family are with him in the U.S. His sons\nare U.S. citizens and his mother-in-law is in the process of emigrating to the U.S. He has no contact\nwith his mother or father. He does not wish to return to Iran. He has not been to Iran since he left 30\nyears ago.\nFI MC AG \u00b6 8 (c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation does not\napply in this case. Applicant has monthly contacts with his Aunt by telephone. His wife calls her\nmother frequently and he speaks to her brother several times a year.34\nApplicant's statement about his loyalty to the U. S. is credible, and there is no reason to\nbelieve that he would take any action which could cause potential harm to his U.S. family or to this\ncountry. If the Iranian government should threaten harm to his family member living in Iran to contact\nhim, I am persuaded that he would report this activity to the U.S. authorities. There is no evidence\nthat he has revealed to his family in Iran the nature of his work or about applying for a position of\npublic trust. I cannot, however, find that Applicant has mitigated the government's security concerns\nas to Guideline B because the absence of evidence does not overcome the heavy burden the Appeal\nBoard has established through case law concerning applicant's from Iran.\n\n11\nDrug Involvement\nApplicant admits that he used pain killers, without a prescription, with varying frequency from\n1999 until February 2003. He tested positive several times for a prescription drug in 2001 and 2002.\nThis raises Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) AG \u00b6 25 (a) (any drug abuse) and\n25 (b) (testing positive for illegal drug use).\nApplicant has been in recovery since 2000, when he voluntarily entered a treatment program.\nDespite his relapses, he is following his treatment program under the State Board Program, and no\nlonger uses drugs. He has been sober for four years. Applicant attends self-help meetings, group\ntherapy, and is subject to random drug screening. He is in compliance with all the requirements under\nhis Consent Agreement. He completed outpatient treatment after his relapse in 2001 and 2003.\nApplicant's pharmacy license is restricted at this point by the State Board to an environment in which\nhe does not dispense drugs. He has been successful in this environment since 2003 and enjoys the\nwork. He has insight into his problems with stress and depression. He currently takes prescription\nmedication for the depression and works with his physician closely in monitoring his health. His\nprobation status ends in 2008. Thus Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC) AG \u00b6 26 (b)\na demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (2) changing or avoiding the\nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence applies. Thus, Applicant\nhas mitigated the security concerns under Drug Involvement.\nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant was terminated from two pharmacies for stealing prescription drugs from the\ninventory and using them without a prescription in 2001 and 2003. He also failed two drug screening\ntests while under his consent agreement with the state board. His license was put in a probationary\nstatus. Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16 (d) credible adverse information\nthat is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an\nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability... is raised in this case.\nApplicant acknowledged his problem, obtained counseling and continued to work diligently\nto retain his license. He paid restitution and bound himself to a Consent Agreement so that he could\ncontinue to recover and yet change his behavior. Despite relapse, he persevered and is on the last year\nof a 5 year probation. He recognized that it may well serve him to avoid the retail component of his\nrole as a pharmacist. Thus, Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) AG \u00b6 17 (d) the\nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother  positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or the inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur applies in this case.\n  \nWhole Person \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. As noted above, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in\nconsidering the whole person concept. It recognizes a person be viewed by the totality of his or her\n\nThe concerns under personal conduct and drug involvement are mitigated and thus, I do not address them.\n35\n12\nacts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits,\ntaking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.\nI considered both the record evidence and Applicant in light of the whole-person concept.\nForeign influence does not involve misconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and\nbehavior changes, etc.  Accordingly, the eighth adjudicative process factor is probably the most\n35\nrelevant. The eighth factor provides, \" the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress.\"\nIran's government is hostile to the United States and does not conform to widely accepted norms of\nhuman rights. Applicant has close, multiple family member who live in Iran. He has frequent contact\nwith them. Under the circumstances, there is a significant possibility of pressure, coercion,\nexploitation or duress. \nAs indicated in the statement of facts, there are many other countervailing, positive attributes\nto Applicant's life as a U.S. citizen. He is patriotic, loves the U. S. and would not permit Iran to\nexploit him. he has close ties to the United States. his closest family members are his wife and two\nchildren. They are U.S. citizens and live with him. Because his wife and children live in the U.S.,\nthey are not vulnerable to coercion or exploitation, except possibly indirectly through relatives, who\nstill live in Iran. Applicant has lived in the United States for 30 years. He and his wife are attempting\nto have his mother-in-law emigrate to the U.S. The \"whole person\" analysis in a Guideline B case\nshould include \"the totality of an applicant's conduct and circumstances including the realistic\npotential for exploitation as well as the eight factors discussed in the previous paragraph. In this case,\nApplicant's potential for exploitation is low. I base this finding on his credible and sincere testimony,\nand I do not believe he would compromise national security, or otherwise comply with Iranian\nthreats. However, the absence of evidence under the Appeal Board's jurisprudence is of very limited\nprobative value and information about his strong connections to the U. S. are insufficient to outweigh\nGuideline B concerns. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the\ntrustworthiness concerns pertaining to foreign influence. Because any doubts must be resolved in\nfavor of national security, I find the allegations regarding foreign influence in the government's\nfavor. Eligibility is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n              Formal Findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:           \nAgainstApplicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n13\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3. a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3. b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant eligibility for a position of trustworthiness to Applicant.

Glendon, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant left South Korea when he was nine and never returned. Applicant, his \nsiblings, his spouse, his two children and his father all live in the United States. The \nsecurity concern pertains to his relationship with his father, who frequently meets with \nhigh-level South Korean officials and acts as an unofficial liaison between South Korean \nofficials and U.S. citizens and officials. Applicant has significantly greater contacts with \nthe United States than with South Korea. He can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of U.S. interests. Foreign influence security concerns are mitigated. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 4, 2005, Applicant submitted a Standard Form 86, Security \nClearance Application (EPSQ version) (SF 86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On \nDecember 31, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, alleging security concerns under Guideline B \n(Foreign Influence) (GE 5). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of \nApril 8, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as \namended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn January 16, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge (GE 6). Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non February 12, 2009. The case was assigned to me on February 17, 2009. On \nFebruary 24, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (GE 4). The hearing was held on \nMarch 25, 2009. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered three exhibits (GEs 1-3) \n(Transcript (Tr.) 22-23), and Applicant offered 23 exhibits (Tr. 25-35; AE A-W). There \nwere no objections, and I admitted GEs 1-3 (Tr. 23), and AEs A-W (Tr. 35). Additionally, \nI admitted the SOR, response to the SOR and the hearing notice (GEs 4-6). I received \nthe transcript on April 2, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice (AN) of facts concerning a \nSouth Korean/North Korean Committee (AN Ex. I and II) and relating to South Korea \n(AN Ex. III) (Tr. 23-24). Department Counsel provided supporting documents to show \ndetail and context for these facts. Applicant did not object, and I took administrative \nnotice of all of the facts in all of the documents (Tr. 23-24; AN I-III). See the South \nKorean/North Korean Committee and South Korea sections of the Findings of Fact of \nthis decision, infra (AN Ex. I to III). \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice at ISCR \nproceedings, is accorded to facts that are either well known or from government reports. \nSee Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types \nof facts for administrative notice).  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in his response to the SOR (GE 6). His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n1The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, names of \ncommittees or other groups or locations in order to protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited \nsources contain more specific information. \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nApplicant is 37 years old (Tr. 6, 36). He graduated from a U.S. high school in \n1990 and received his bachelors degree in 1995 from a U.S. college (Tr. 7, 37, 38). His \nbachelors degree was in business administration with a major in accounting (Tr. 7). He \nalso has a masters of science degree from a U.S. educational institution (Tr. 7). \nApplicant\u2019s interim security clearance was revoked, and he does not currently hold a \nsecurity clearance (Tr. 8). \n  \nApplicant, his father and siblings moved to the United States in 1981, when \nApplicant was nine years old (Tr. 37). Applicant\u2019s mother died before Applicant \nimmigrated to the United States (GE 3). Since his arrival in the United States, Applicant \nhas not had any contact with his mother\u2019s family (GE 3). He has not returned to South \nKorea after leaving in 1981 (Tr. 45, 51). Two of Applicant\u2019s South Korean family \nmembers (uncles) visit the United States from South Korea every two years or so, and \nApplicant might meet with them on these visits (GE 3). Applicant\u2019s contact with these \nrelatives occurs when they visit the United States (GE 3). Applicant received his green \ncard in August 1998 (Tr. 40). He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in October 2004 (Tr. \n36).  \n \nFrom 2003 to 2007, Applicant worked for a government contractor first as a \nproposal manager and later as a business director (Tr. 42-43). From 2007 to the \npresent, Applicant has been employed by another government contractor as a vice \npresident of a corporate division that focuses on business development (Tr. 43-44).  \n \nApplicant owns two houses in the United States (Tr. 51). He has two U.S. 401K \naccounts with a total value of about $70,000 (AE B, E) and his spouse has a U.S. 401K \naccount valued at $153,000 (AE C). He has two children, who were born in the United \nStates (Tr. 51). He does not have any foreign property or bank accounts (GE 2). He \ndoes not intend to live permanently in South Korea (Tr. 51). He has never been arrested \nfor a felony, or a drug or alcohol-related offense (Tr. 52; GE 1). He has not had financial \nproblems (Tr. 52). He has not served in the U.S. or South Korean military (GE 1). \n \nApplicant is not involved in any South Korea-related leagues, organizations or \npolitical committees (Tr. 87). Applicant offered to renounce his South Korean citizenship \n(Tr. 47, 52); however, Applicant has not taken any action to renounce his South Korean \ncitizenship (Tr. 45). He was not aware of a process for ending his South Korean \ncitizenship (Tr. 52). Applicant\u2019s father informed the South Korean government that \nApplicant would not be returning to South Korea for military service for an indefinite \nperiod (Tr. 46). Applicant did not know about the Korean Family Relations Certificate or \nKorean Family Census Register (Tr. 54-55). Applicant renewed his South Korean \npassport in 1995; however, it is now expired (Tr. 45, 47; GE 1, 3).2 Applicant does not \nintend to renew his South Korean passport (Tr. 50). His most recent use of his South \nKorean passport was when he went to Japan in 1999 (Tr. 48).  \n \n \n2Department counsel stated that it was the position of the Chief Department Counsel that turning-\nin an expired passport to a security manager or taking other actions to invalidate it was unnecessary (Tr. \n50). \n \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                             \nApplicant married in 2001 (GE 1). His wife was born in Japan, and her parents \nlive in Japan (Tr. 48). She does not own any property in Japan (Tr. 49). She has a \ncousin and an aunt and uncle living in the United States (Tr. 49). She has a green card \n(GE 2). Applicant does not communicate with her family in Japan because he does not \nspeak Japanese. \n \nApplicant obtained a U.S. passport in 2007 (Tr. 49). He has not used his U.S. \npassport to travel (Tr. 49). \n \nThe gist of the security concern in this case is that until 2007 Applicant\u2019s father \n(F) had an active role in a South Korean/North Korean Committee with the goal of \nunification of South and North Korea (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c; GE 5).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father \n \nApplicant\u2019s father (F) was born in South Korea 66 years ago (Tr. 58-59). F came \nto the United States in 1981 on a student visa (GE 2). F\u2019s mother is 92 years old and \nlives in South Korea (Tr. 63). F has nine siblings (Tr. 61). Three siblings live in the \nUnited States and three siblings live in South Korea (Tr. 61-62). Three siblings, who \nlived in South Korea, are deceased (Tr. 63). Although F\u2019s brothers served in the South \nKorean Army, none of F\u2019s siblings or brothers-in-law worked for the South Korean \ngovernment (Tr. 63-64). One of F\u2019s brothers retired from the South Korean Army as a \nlieutenant (Tr. 65). F\u2019s other brothers and brothers-in-law were enlisted soldiers (Tr. 65). \nF was in the South Korean Army for three years and rose to the rank of sergeant (Tr. \n64). F served with U.S. airmen in Vietnam during the Vietnam war (Tr. 64, 89, 90). F \nhas three sons and all three sons live in the United States (Tr. 60). In 1981, F brought \nhis family to the United States from South Korea (Tr. 60). F\u2019s first wife, Applicant\u2019s \nmother, passed away (Tr. 60). F remarried; however, he is now divorced (Tr. 60).  \n \nIn 1996, F became a U.S. citizen (Tr. 39). F has been in the residential \nconstruction business since 1986 (Tr. 68, 88). F has renovated houses and military \nbarracks (Tr. 88). Applicant worked for his father until 1999 (Tr. 41). F owns two houses \nin the United States (Tr. 51; AE G). F has a U.S. money market account valued in \nMarch 2009 at about $177,000 (AE G). F uses a U.S. passport to travel, and does not \nhave a currently valid South Korean passport (Tr. 53, 79).   \n \nIn 1975 or 1976, F tried to become elected to a special committee for peaceful \nreunification of North and South Korea (SC/NC committee); however, he lost his initial \nbid to be on the SC/NC committee (Tr. 66-69). In June 1980, a high-level official in the \nSouth Korean government appointed F as an advisory member to the SC/NC committee \n(Tr. 70, 72-73; GE 3). In 1981, F resigned from his SC/NC committee position because \nhe was moving to the United States (GE 3). In 1996, F became an honorary member of \nthe same committee; however, F ended his honorary committee membership two years \nago (Tr. 73-74; GE 3).  \n \nIn 1996 and 1997 at F\u2019s behest, Applicant attended three meetings of the SC/NC \ncommittee (GE 3). The SC/NC committee meetings were attended by South Korean \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nofficials as well as American political officials (GE 3). Applicant has not attended any \nSC/NC committee meetings after 1997 (GE 3).  Applicant is not interested in attending \nfuture SC/NC committee meetings (GE 3).  \n \nIn 1992, F joined and has thereafter been active in a local Korean-American \nassociation (KAA) (Tr. 73; GE 3). In 1993, he was the vice president of KAA GE 3).  \n \nF also had a leadership position in a Korean-American citizenship league (KACL) \n(Tr. 74; GE 3). The KACL\u2019s goal is to register Korean Americans to vote and to assist \nSouth Korean immigrants to the United States with becoming better, more successful \nAmericans (Tr. 84; AE F). The KACL has received citations and/or letters of \nappreciation/commendation from President Bush (AE K), the White House (AE J), and \ntwo U.S. state governors (Tr. 85; AE I, L, M, T, U). In connection with a KACL function, \nF provided photographs of himself with the U.S. Secretary of Defense (AE O, P), the \nU.S. Secretary of Labor (AE Q) and two U.S. state governors (AE R, S). The KACL \ngave F a certificate of appreciation/recognition in 2005 for his leadership (AE V). The \nKACL\u2019s 2003 national conference program features letters from various U.S. political \nleaders, including President Bush and several other high-level U.S. political and retired \nU.S. military leaders (AE W). The KACL has held fund raisers for U.S. projects, such as \nrepair to a fire station or for a 9-11 memorial at the Pentagon (Tr. 86). The KACL \nprovides volunteers to help at U.S. events (Tr. 86-87).  \n \nF has attended a social affair at the South Korean embassy and had dinner with \na South Korean diplomatic official in the last year (Tr. 75-77). F travels to South Korea \nonce or twice a year (Tr. 77). He usually visits his mother and siblings in South Korea; \nbut also sometimes meets with South Korean government officials (Tr. 78). He also \nmeets with representatives in the U.S. Congress, who are interested in South Korean \nissues (Tr. 78). F is a U.S. citizen, not a South Korean citizen (Tr. 79). F\u2019s name has \nbeen removed from the South Korean register of citizens (Tr. 79). F loves the United \nStates and is loyal to the United States (Tr. 88). F does not plan on serving in the South \nKorean government (Tr. 88). F often focuses on the duty of U.S. citizens to defend their \ncountry (Tr. 90, 91). \n \nF believed that Applicant automatically lost his South Korean citizenship, when \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen (Tr. 80-81). F does not own any property in South \nKorea (Tr. 81). F and Applicant live about 30 or 35 miles apart, and they see each other \nabout once a month (Tr. 82). F and Applicant talk about twice a month (Tr. 82). \n \nSouth Korean/North Korean Committee (SC/NC committee)3 \n \n \nThe goal of the SC/NC committee is peaceful unification of North and South \nKorea. The SC/NC committee monitors political developments, and encourages greater \ncommunication and cooperation between North and South Korea. It also offers advice \nand suggestions about unification. The SC/NC committee communicates with the \n \n3The facts in the section concerning the SC/NC committee are from documents Department \nCounsel submitted at the hearing (AN I to II). \n \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nhighest levels of the South Korean government. High-level South Korean government \nofficials are members of the SC/NC committee. \n \nSouth Korea4 \n \nSouth Korea is currently a stable, democratic republic. The United States and \nSouth Korea have been close allies since 1950, and have fought communism on the \nKorean peninsula and in Vietnam. The United States, since 1950 and currently, has \nthousands of U.S. military personnel stationed in South Korea, and frequently conducts \njoint military operations with South Korea. About 2.3 million Koreans live in the United \nStates. The United States has promised over the next four years to provide $11 billion in \nforce enhancements in Korea. South Korea is the United States\u2019 seventh largest trading \npartner. The recently signed free trade agreement between the United States and South \nKorea will generate billions of dollars in additional economic growth and job creation in \nboth countries.     \n \nThe South Korean government generally respects the human rights of its \ncitizens. Criminals violate the human rights of some South Korean citizens. South Korea \nhas some political prisoners, and some rules regarding arrest and detention are vague. \n \nSouth Korea does not recognize dual citizenship. There have been \ncircumstances where U.S. citizens with connections to South Korea were drafted into \nthe South Korean army (Applicant at age 37 is beyond the South Korean draft age limit \nof 35).  \n \nIn recent years, the United States and South Korea have differed in their \ndiplomatic approaches towards North Korea. The United States\u2019 position is more \nassertive in its attempts to curtail North Korea\u2019s development of advanced military \ntechnology, such as ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. South Korea has \nemphasized steps towards unification of North and South Korea. \n \nIndustrial espionage includes seeking commercial secrets. South Korea has a \nhistory of collecting protected U.S. information. In 2000, South Korea was listed as one \nof the seven most active countries engaged in foreign economic collection and industrial \nespionage against the United States. In 1997, Lockheed Martin was fined for unlicensed \nexport to South Korea and that same year a civilian employee of the U.S. Navy passed \nclassified documents to the South Korean naval attach\u00e9 to the United States. On \nmultiple occasions, South Korea has been the unauthorized recipient of sensitive \ntechnology, in violation of U.S. export control laws.          \n  \n \n \n \n4The facts in the section concerning South Korea are from Department Counsel\u2019s factual \nsummary (AN III), except for some comments in the first paragraph about the relationship between the \nUnited States and South Korea, which are from the U.S. Department of State, Background Note: South \nKorea, Oct. 2008 (AN III, enclosure I) and U.S. Department of State, Country Specific Information: \nRepublic of Korea, January 2, 2009 (AN III, enclosure II). \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                             \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7.

Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro.

Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude Guideline B (Foreign Influence) is the relevant security concerns with \nrespect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.  \n \nApplicant and his father were both born in South Korea. Applicant has a close \nconnection to his father, F, who has contacts with high-level South Korean diplomats \nand political figures. Applicant communicates frequently with his father, and his father \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \ncommunicates frequently with South Korean political and diplomatic leaders about \nSouth Korea/North Korea unification and/or other issues of Korean/U.S. interest. \nApplicant\u2019s father frequently travels to South Korea. Applicant\u2019s relationship with F is \nsufficient to create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion.\u201d Applicant\u2019s relationship with his father creates a potential conflict \nof interest between Applicant\u2019s \u201cobligation to protect sensitive information or technology \nand [his] desire to help\u201d his father assist South Korea. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person such as F, is not, as a \nmatter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative has a \nrelationship with political or diplomatic leaders of a foreign country, and an Applicant \nhas close contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential \nfor foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. See Generally ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); \nISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of South Korea with the United States, places a significant, but not \ninsurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationship \nwith F, who has a relationship with his siblings living in South Korea as well as South \nKorean government and diplomatic officials do not pose a security risk. Applicant should \nnot be placed into a position where he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the \nUnited States and a desire to assist F.5 South Korea was listed as one of the seven \nmost active countries engaged in foreign economic collection and industrial espionage \nagainst the United States. On multiple occasions, South Korea has been the \nunauthorized recipient of technology controlled under U.S. export control laws. It is \nconceivable that Applicant might be targeted through F in an attempt to gather \ninformation from the United States. \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from South Korea seek or \nhave sought classified or economic information from or through F, nevertheless, his \nrelationship with F creates a potential conflict of interest because his relationship with F \nis sufficiently close to raise a security concern about his desire to assist F by providing \nsensitive or classified information. Department Counsel produced substantial evidence \n \n5 An applicant with relatives in Iran, for example, has a much heavier burden to overcome than an \napplicant with relatives living in South Korea. See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) \n(stating an applicant has \u201ca very heavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns\u201d when \nparents and siblings live in Iran). See also ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) \n(articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d standard when an applicant has family members living in Iran); ISCR \nCase No. 07-12471 at 9 (A.J. May 30, 2008) (listing numerous recent cases involving U.S. citizens with \nIranian connections whose clearances were denied, and citing no recent cases where the Appeal Board \naffirmed the grant of a clearance for someone with immediate family members living in Iran). \n \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                             \nof Applicant\u2019s contacts with F and F\u2019s relationship with South Korean officials to raise \nthe issue of potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) \napply, and further inquiry is necessary about potential application of any mitigating \nconditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) partially applies; however, AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(c), 8(d), and 8(e) do not apply \nbecause the U.S. government has not encouraged Applicant\u2019s involvement with F, or \nF\u2019s involvement with South Korean officials. Applicant has frequent contact with his \nfather, and his father has frequent contact with South Korean government officials. F \nfrequently travels to South Korea. F is interested in South Korean political \ndevelopments. F has siblings and siblings-in-law, as well as his mother, living in South \nKorea. F\u2019s contacts in South Korea are sufficiently frequent to raise the possibility of F \nbeing influenced to ask Applicant for sensitive or classified information. AG \u00b6 8(a) has \nsome partial applicability because it is his father, and not Applicant, who has the \nextensive contacts with South Korean officials. Because of F\u2019s connections to South \nKorea, Applicant is not able to fully meet his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                             \nthat [her relationships with his relatives who are South Korean citizens] could create a \nrisk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d   \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) fully applies. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has established that \n\u201c[he] can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d \nApplicant was born in the United States and moved to South Korea when he was nine \nyears old. He spent the next 28 years in the United States and he has never returned to \nSouth Korea after immigrating to the United States in 1981. Applicant graduated from a \nU.S. high school, a U.S. college, and a U.S. graduate school. Applicant and his spouse \nreside in the United States. His two children were born in the United States. Applicant\u2019s \nsiblings live in the United States. Applicant does not have frequent contacts with any \nSouth Korean residents and citizens. Applicant and his spouse have substantial U.S. \nproperty and investments and they do not have any property or investments in South \nKorea.    \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his father\u2019s relationships with South Korean \ngovernment officials. F frequently meets with South Korean government officials in the \nUnited States and South Korea. South Korea is an aggressive collector of sensitive \neconomic and technological information. There is no evidence; however, that terrorists, \ncriminals, the South Korean government, those conducting industrial espionage or his \nfather have approached or threatened Applicant or that South Korean officials have \nasked F for classified or sensitive information. As such, there is a reduced possibility \nthat F or Applicant himself would be targets for improper South Korean coercion or \nexploitation. While the government does not have any burden to prove the presence of \nsuch evidence, if such record evidence was present, Applicant would have a very heavy \nevidentiary burden to overcome to mitigate foreign influence security concerns.   \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f) partially applies because Applicant has no interest in property or bank \naccounts in South Korea. This mitigating condition can only fully mitigate AG \u00b6 7(e), \nwhich provides, \u201ca substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the \nindividual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections through F to South Korea are less significant \nthan his strong connections to the United States. His connections to the United States \ntaken together are sufficient to fully overcome the foreign influence security concerns \nunder Guideline B.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under this guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning South Korea must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation in South Korea, as well as the dangers existing in South Korea.6 \nSouth Korea is a known collector of U.S. intelligence and sensitive economic \ninformation; however, South Korea has been a close military ally of the United States \nsince the Korean war began in 1950. South Korea and the United States have close \nrelationships in diplomacy and trade. About 2.3 million Koreans live in the United States.      \n \nThe only security concern here is Applicant\u2019s relationship with F, who was active \nin the movement to reunify North and South Korea until 2007. F was a member of the \nSC/NC Committee until 2007, and is currently a member of the KACL and a local \nKorean-American Association. His father continues to have frequent meetings and \ncommunications with high-level South Korean political and diplomatic officials. F acts as \nan informal liaison between South Korean officials and U.S. political figures. His father \nfrequently communicates with his relatives living in South Korea. Applicant\u2019s frequent \ncommunications and visits with F establish his ties of affection to his father. South \nKorea has a history of targeting U.S. industries for sensitive information and firms have \nengaged in export violations, sending sensitive, technologically advanced equipment to \nSouth Korea and other economic espionage. There is some possibility that Applicant or \nF could be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the United States. It \nis possible that South Korean intelligence agents could attempt to pressure Applicant or \nF to gain some kind of advantage over Applicant to obtain classified or sensitive \ninformation.  \n \nThe circumstances militating towards approval of a clearance for Applicant are \nmore significant. Applicant left South Korea in 1981 at the age of nine years and has \nnever returned. He has infrequent contacts with his relatives living in South Korea. He \ndoes not own property in South Korea, and has not manifested any direct connections \nwith South Korea. His siblings and father all live in the United States. He received his \n \n6 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion). \n  \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \neducation and all of his employment in the United States. He is a U.S. citizen and swore \nallegiance to the United States. His father is also U.S. citizen, and professes a primary \nloyalty to the United States. His father does not own property or have bank accounts in \nSouth Korea. Applicant\u2019s wife is a green card holder, and both of his children are U.S. \nborn citizens. Applicant\u2019s involvement with any South Korea-related organizations was \nlimited to three meetings in the late 1990s. The South Korea league\u2019s goal is to \nencourage Korean immigrants to the United States to become U.S. citizens and to \nparticipate in U.S. elections. It emphasizes U.S. civic responsibility. Until 2007, \nApplicant\u2019s father\u2019s communications with high-level South Korean political and \ndiplomatic officials were primarily designed to facilitate peaceful reunification of North \nand South Korea. There is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s father has participated in any \norganization that has acted or would act against U.S. interests. Recently, his father\u2019s \ncommunications with South Korean officials are related to encouraging Korean-\nAmericans and Korean immigrants to participate in the U.S. political process and raising \nfunds for charitable projects, such as a monument to the victims of the 9/11 attack at the \nPentagon. Applicant\u2019s father has very strong connections to the United States and it is \nunlikely he would cooperate with any attempt to compromise U.S. interests through the \nexploitation of his son. Although the possibility of attempted exploitation of Applicant is \nvery low, Applicant\u2019s strong connections to the United States and especially to his U.S. \nfamily, community and employment establish \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., [he] can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor \nof the U.S. interest.\u201d   \n \nAfter weighing the evidence of her connections to South Korea and to the United \nStates, and all the facts in this decision, I conclude Applicant has carried his burden of \nmitigating the foreign influence security concerns. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d7 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, all the evidence in this decision, and my interpretation of my responsibilities \nunder the Guidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: \n For Applicant \n \n \n7See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Applicant answered the SOR on October\n1\n10, 2006, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on February 27, 2007. On March 28, 2007, DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing scheduling the case for May 15, 2007. During the hearing, I received 11 government\nexhibits, 15 Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of four Applicant witnesses. At the conclusion of\nthe hearing, I left the record open through May 25, 2007 for Applicant to submit additional exhibits.\nThat day, she submitted an additional exhibit. Department Counsel did not object to its admissibility.\nI then marked it as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits P and incorporated them into the record. DOHA received the\ntranscript on May 24, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant is a 39-year-old married woman with five children, ages 11 through 19. She has a\nhigh school diploma, and has worked various part-time jobs over the years. Since 1994, she has been\na homemaker. Currently, she is seeking a clearance to enable her to provide administrative support\nfor her husband\u2019s consulting firm.  Over the years, she has been minimally involved in managing the\n2\nfamily finances.3\nApplicant\u2019s husband is an Air Force veteran. While in the Air Force, he worked in\ncommunications and information technology.  After leaving, he continued to work in these fields for\n4\ndefense contractors through the early 1990s. In approximately 1996, he left the defense contracting\nindustry and began performing information systems implementations for hospitals.  He worked on\n5\nstaff for a hospital for two years.\n\nExhibit 1, Security Clearance Application, dated September 23, 2004, at 2.\n6\nExhibit K, Reference Letter of Chief Financial Officer of a Hospital Client, dated March 12, 2007, Exhibit L,\n7\nClient Reference Letter, dated March 14, 2007, Exhibit M, Client Reference Letter, dated March 14, 2007.\nTr. 188.\n8\nTr. 126-128; 165.\n9\nExhibit H, Release of State Income Tax Lien for Tax Year 2000, dated August 17, 2006; Exhibit I, Release\n10\nof State Income Tax Lien for Tax Years 2002 and 2003, dated September 6, 2006.\nExhibit P, Receipt of Payment, dated May 22, 2007; Exhibit D, Release of Judgment Lien, dated August 10,\n11\n2006.\nAnswer, dated October 10, 2007, at 1.\n12\n3\nIn 1998, Applicant\u2019s husband left the hospital job, and started a consulting firm.  He does the\n6\nsame type of work he did when employed with the hospital. Throughout the life of the business, he\nhas been very adept at recruiting clients, marketing his business, and servicing the contracts.7\nConversely, his financial management skills, for the most part, have been poor. When he first\nstarted his business, he failed to set aside money in an income tax escrow account,  and was unable\n8\nto pay them when due. Also, he failed to segregate his business expenses from his personal expenses,\nand consequently began losing track of both. During this same period, he became financially\noverextended further, purchasing two rental properties, and raising race horses.9\nApplicant and her husband have had sporadic health insurance, since starting the business.\nThis rendered it difficult for them to distinguish between medical bills that were solely their\nresponsibility and those that their insurance provider covered. Also, they experienced financial\nhardship when the business was not making any money. Consequently, their bills grew delinquent.\nBy July 2006, Applicant had accrued approximately $30,400 of delinquent debt.\nApproximately $28,590 consisted of state income tax liens filed against her and her husband\u2019s\nproperty in 2002 for tax year 2000 (subparagraph 1.a), 2004 for tax year 2002 (subparagraph 1.d), and\n2005 for tax year 2003 (subparagraph 1.h). By September 2006, they had satisfied them in their\nentirety, and the liens were released.10\nApproximately $1,800 consists of medical bills (subparagraphs 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g). Neither\nApplicant nor her family have experienced any chronic or severely disabling injuries. Many of her\nchildren, however, have frequently injured themselves while participating in athletics. \nShe satisfied subparagraphs 1.e and 1.g.  Subparagraphs 1.c and 1.f, collectively totaling\n11\napproximately $1,300, are owed to the same collection agency. She was unaware of them at the time\nshe received the SOR, and is currently in the process of tracking down the original creditors so that\nshe can satisfy them.12\n\nTr. 250.\n13\nTr. 251.\n14\nTr. 223.\n15\nTr. 226, 229 \u2013Testimony of Banker.\n16\nTr. 237.\n17\nTr. 235.\n18\nTr. 277.\n19\nSee Husband\u2019s SF 86, Exhibit 1 of Industrial Security Clearance Review of Applicant\u2019s Husband (ISCR Case\n20\nNo. 06-18535).\nTr. 277.\n21\n4\nThe remaining delinquency, subparagraph 1.b, originates from a $91 bounced check that\nApplicant wrote to a department store. She paid it.  She attempted to obtain a confirmation of\n13\npayment before the hearing, but was unsuccessful because the creditor is no longer in business.14\nApplicant\u2019s ability to pay these delinquencies in a short period of time, after they had lingered\nfor years, resulted from a drastic improvement in her husband\u2019s business in January 2006, after he\nwas awarded several contracts. According to their personal banker, who testified at the hearing, the\nbusiness\u2019 reserves, since that time, have been growing \u201cvery steadily and very quickly.\u201d  Currently,\n15\nthey own several other businesses in addition to the consulting business. The combined gross revenue\nof the companies, and the gross value of their real estate holdings exceed two million dollars.16\nSince 2004, Applicant\u2019s husband has been delegating the financial management of the\nbusiness to an accountant. Although he had worked with the same accountant since 1999, the work\nwas limited to filing tax returns.  Since 2004, the accountant has been handling the \u201cpayroll\n17\nprocessing, fil[ing ]the required tax deposits, . . . preparing annual general ledger[s]. . . and handl[ing]\nthe checkbook[s] for the corporation.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s husband will consult his accountant before\n18\nmaking any future investments.\nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d in response to Question 36 (Your Financial Record - Tax Lien   In\nthe last 7 years, have you had a lien placed against your property for failing to pay taxes or other\ndebts?), Question 38 (Your Financial Delinquencies - 180 Days - In the last 7 years, have you been\nover 180 days delinquent on any debt?), and Question 39 (Your Financial Delinquencies - 90 days -\nAre you currently over 90 days past due on any debt(s)) of the security clearance application (SF 86).\nTwo liens were outstanding when she executed the SF 86. Also, the debts listed in subparagraph 1.b\nand 1.c were more than 180 days delinquent when she completed it.\nApplicant was aware of the state tax liens, but thought they were against property owned\nsolely by her husband.  Her husband disclosed the liens on his SF 86, completed on the same day she\n19\ncompleted hers.  She was unaware of the other delinquencies when she completed the SF 86.\n20\n21\nPOLICIES\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n22\n5\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in\nthe evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline,\nthe adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny\nor revoke an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and\nthose that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to\nclassified information (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nThe following adjudicative guidelines are raised:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could\nindicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about\na person\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. \nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in\nthe conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in\neach case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n22\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that have\nbeen controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n6\nFinancial Considerations\nApplicant is a homemaker whose husband handled the majority of their finances. Because the\nmajority of the debts are in both of their names, however, Financial Considerations Disqualifying\nCondition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (A history of not meeting financial obligations) and FC DC\nE2.A6.1.2.3 (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), applies to her also.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were neither recent nor isolated. Financial Considerations\nMitigating Conditions (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.1 (The behavior was not recent), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2\n(It was an isolated incident) do not apply.\nApplicant neither earned any income in the late 1990s nor helped with the management of her\nhusband\u2019s business which he started at that time. Her financial well-being, however, was totally\ndependent on the success of the company. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (The conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) applies.\nApplicant\u2019s husband retained an accountant to manage the finances of his business. This has\nenabled him to focus more on business development. The business has grown tremendously, enabling\nhim to satisfy all of the delinquencies that he and his wife could identify, in their entirety. Although\nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) does not apply because\nneither received counseling, FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts), applies because of their repayment efforts over the past\n18 months.\nApplicant\u2019s remaining delinquent debt is minimal in comparison to the debt which she has\nsatisfied. Given the family\u2019s improved financial circumstances, and the track record of reform\ndemonstrated by satisfying the overwhelming majority of the delinquencies, I am confident that\nApplicant will pay the remainder, as promised at the hearing.  She has mitigated the financial\nconsiderations security concern.\nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant\u2019s responses to Questions 36, 38, and 39 of her 2004 SF 86 raise the issue of whether\nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition E2.A5.1.2.2 (The deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits\nor status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities) applies.\nApplicant\u2019s husband submitted his SF 86 on the same day as wife. He disclosed the tax liens,\nthat she omitted. Under these circumstances, I conclude her explanation for omitting them was\ncredible, and she possessed no intent to conceal them..\n\n7\nAs a homemaker, Applicant is focused on raising her children. Her husband manages the\nfinances. Consequently, her testimony that she was unaware of the other SOR delinquencies at the\ntime she completed the SF 86 was also credible.\nApplicant did not falsify her SF 86. PC DC E2.A5.1.2.2 is inapplicable, and there are no\npersonal conduct security concerns.\nCriminal Conduct\nFor the reasons set forth above, Applicant\u2019s responses to Questions 36, 38 and 39 do not\nconstitute falsifications under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant has satisfied the majority of her delinquencies. As a homemaker who earned no\nincome, her financial problems were caused by her husband\u2019s past business misfortunes. After\nstruggling for several years, the business is stable and prosperous. Her husband has retained an\naccountant to ensure that the business\u2019 finances remain organized. These factors render the potential\nfor coercion nonexistent at present, and the potential for recurrence minimal. Evaluating these facts\nin the context of the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concern.\nClearance is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 - Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3 - Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 19, 2008,\nafter the hearing, Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\ntrustworthiness designation.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his application\nof the pertinent mitigating conditions and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness determination\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   Finding no error, we affirm.\n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a 33-year-old employee\nof a defense contractor.  He holds an associates degree.  He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from\n1997 through 2005, when he was discharged with a General Discharge.  In 1994, Applicant received\nnon-judicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for a minor\noffense.

Applicant repeatedly violated those orders.  \nWhen interviewed by an agent for the Defense Investigative Service (DIS), Applicant denied\nthe sexual relationship and assault.  He admitted, however, that he had spoken with the Lance\nCorporal after receiving the MPO.  During a second interview, Applicant stated that he had a\npending Special Court-Martial for assault, adultery, and violation of the MPO.  Applicant admitted\nto the agent that he had contacted the Lance Corporal in violation of the MPO on \u201cmultiple\noccasions.\u201d  Decision at 3.  At his trial, Applicant was charged with violating a general order; failure\nto obey the MPO; two specifications of assault; adultery; and wrongfully impeding an investigation.\nPleading not guilty, he was convicted of violating a general order and adultery.  He was found not\nguilty of the remaining charges.  \n\u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does\nnot turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather,\ntheir application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d\nSee ADP Case No. 05-12037 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2007).  A trustworthiness determination must\nbe guided by common sense in light of the record as a whole.  See Directive \u00b6   E2.2.3.  The Board\n\n\u201cI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances\n3\nsurrounding this case.  Applicant committed criminal offenses which ultimately cost him his military career.  He has been\nuntruthful about his criminal acts throughout this process, including providing false testimony at his hearing.  He has a\nfavorable work record and served honorably for most of his career in the Marine Corps.  Despite the positive evidence,\nApplicant\u2019s actions raise serious concerns about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Overall, the record\nevidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position.  For\nall these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from his criminal conduct.\u201d\nDecision at 8.  \n3\nhas examined Applicant\u2019s brief on appeal in light of the Judge\u2019s decision and the record as a whole.\nThe Judge considered appropriate mitigating conditions, but he concluded that none served to\nmitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s military record as described above.3\nApplicant disagrees with the weight that the Judge assigned various aspects of the case.  However,\n\u201c[m]ere disagreement with the weight assigned particular evidence by a Judge does not establish\nerror.\u201d ADP No. 06-02549 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  See also Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.15.  (\u201cThe\napplicant . . . has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable . . .  decision\u201d). \nThe Judge\u2019s explanation for his conclusion that Applicant had not overcome the\ntrustworthiness concerns raised by the Government\u2019s evidence is reasonable.  See ADP Case 04-\n08945 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 27, 2007).

The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, \nPersonnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 29, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on April 2, 2008. \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on April 15, 2008. I convened the hearing as \nJune 19, 2008\n\n2 \nscheduled on May 28, 2008. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June \n5, 2008.  \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel made an oral motion to amend SOR \u00b6 1.a by changing the \ndate in the allegation from \u201c2004\u201d to \u201c2005.\u201d Applicant did not object to the motion and it \nwas granted.  \n \nEvidence \n \nThe Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8. Applicant did not object to \nany of the documents except the part of GE 2 which referenced Applicant\u2019s nonjudicial \npunishment (NJP) received while in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1994. He objected to the \nadmission of the NJP based upon relevance and the age of the NJP. Department \nCounsel argued that Applicant\u2019s entire military record was relevant and that it would \nrebut the favorable character evidence that Applicant planned to present. I withheld \nruling on the objection until after Applicant presented his case. GE 1 through 8 were \nadmitted except for the part of GE 2 which referenced Applicant\u2019s 1994 NJP.  \n \nApplicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through G. \nDepartment Counsel objected to the admission of AE D, a security clearance \napplication, on the basis that it was unsigned. The objection was overruled. Department \nCounsel objected to AE E, extracts from the record of trial of Applicant\u2019s Special Court-\nMartial, on the basis of completeness. Applicant stated that he had a complete copy of \nthe record of trial, but that he did not have it with him. I informed Applicant that I would \nhold the record open and ask him to submit a complete copy of the record of trial. \nApplicant withdrew his offer of AE E. AE A through D, F, and G were admitted. \nApplicant\u2019s exhibits reference his entire military record. I overruled Applicant\u2019s objection \nto GE 2 and it was admitted in its entirety. \n \nI held the record open until June 11, 2008, for Applicant to submit additional \nmatters. I requested that Applicant submit a copy of the record of trial of his Special \nCourt-Martial. Applicant submitted a one page memo (AE H), four pages of e-mail traffic \n(AE I), a computer diskette (AE J), and the record of trial of his Special Court-Martial \n(AE K). The exhibits were received without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s memo is \nHearing Exhibit (HE) I. The record closed on June 11, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is married with \ntwo children, ages seven and three. He has an associate\u2019s degree. Applicant served in \nthe United States Marine Corps from 1997 through 2005, and was discharged as a \nCorporal (E-4) with a General (Under Honorable Conditions) Discharge.1 \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 44-45, 57, 62-64; GE 1, 2. \n \n\n3 \n \nApplicant\u2019s Marine Corps career, but for nonjudicial punishment for a minor \noffense in 1994, was commendatory until about 2003. He received numerous awards, \ndecorations, and accolades and his fitness reports were excellent. He was promoted to \nStaff Sergeant (E-6) and was selected for promotion to Gunnery Sergeant (E-7). \nApplicant began to have an inappropriate sexual relationship with a female subordinate \nin about 2003. The female Lance Corporal (E-3) eventually reported Applicant and \nstated he assaulted her. A Military Protection Order (MPO) was issued by Applicant\u2019s \nCommanding Officer on October 9, 2003, directing him to have no contact with the \nfemale Lance Corporal. The order was effective until November 7, 2003. A second MPO \nwas issued on November 13, 2003, to be in effect until cancelled by the Commanding \nOfficer or higher authority. Applicant repeatedly violated the orders.2 \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed for his security clearance investigation by a Special \nAgent of the Defense Investigative Service (DIS) on January 29, 2004. He denied \nengaging in a sexual relationship with the female subordinate and that he assaulted her. \nHe admitted he \u201chad feelings\u201d for her. He also admitted that he spoke with her in person \nand left a voice mail message for her after the MPO was issued. He stated he was \nattempting to get her to tell \u201cthe truth\u201d that they did not have sexual relations.3 \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed again by a DIS Special Agent on April 4, 2004. He \nadmitted that he was charged with assault, adultery, and violation of an MPO, and was \ngoing to a Special Court-Martial. The DIS agent questioned him about allegations that \nhe contacted the Lance Corporal telephonically 20 to 30 times and had in-person \ncontact on two additional occasions. He admitted he contacted her on \u201cmultiple \noccasions.\u201d He stated he \u201cdidn\u2019t tell [DIS] this on 29 Jan 04, [because he] did not believe \nit relevant.\u201d He also admitted that he had an additional in-person contact with her.4 He \nwrote in his statement: \n \nYes, the other aforesaid contacts were in violation of the MPOs. However, \nlooking back on it, I have much more at stake, i.e. my career and family. I \nconsidered my career & family more important than the MPOs. Also I\u2019ve \nbeen taught to meet problems head on.5 \n \n \nApplicant was charged at a Special Court-Martial in February 2005, with violating \na general order; failure to obey a Military Protection Order; two specifications of assault; \nadultery; and wrongfully impeding an investigation, under the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice. He pled not guilty to all charges. He was found guilty of violating a general \norder and adultery and not guilty of the remaining charges. He was sentenced to \nperform hard labor for two months; to forfeit $200 pay per month for two months; and to \nbe reduced to the pay grade of E-4.6 \n                                                          \n2 Tr. at 45-50, 67-68; GE 2-4; AE K.  \n \n3 GE 5. \n \n4 GE 6. \n \n5 Id. \n \n6 GE 2; AE K. \n\n4 \n \n \nApplicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SF-86) on September 16, \n2005. He listed his court-martial conviction under Question 25, \u201cYour Police Record \u2013 \nMilitary Court.\u201d He provided further details under Question 43, \u201cGeneral Remarks.\u201d7  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Public Trust Application (SF-85P), certified as true on \nSeptember 21, 2005. Question 16 asked, \u201cYour Police Record   In the last 7 years, \nhave you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s)? (leave out \ntraffic fines of less than $150.\u201d Applicant answered \u201cYes,\u201d and listed a speeding offense \nin May 2003. He did not list his court-martial conviction.8  \n \nApplicant denied the falsification allegation in the SOR. He stated he already \nprovided the requested information via the SF-86 and did not understand the specific \nquestion in the SF-85P.9 After considering all the evidence, I find there is insufficient \nevidence for a finding that Applicant intentionally falsified his Public Trust Application as \nalleged in the SOR.  \n \nApplicant denied engaging in a sexual relationship with the female subordinate in \nstatements given on January 29, 2004 and April 9, 2004. He stated in a background \ninterview on June 6, 2007, that he and the subordinate had developed a \u201cbuddy\u201d type \nrelationship. He was asked by Interrogatories to authenticate the report of investigation \n(ROI) of the interview of June 6, 2007. He made several changes to the ROI and further \nstated on October 15, 2007, \u201cI would only like to add that the verdict given was based \non no solid proof and only questionable testimony from a perjuring and disgraceful \nwitness.\u201d In his response to the SOR, Applicant denied the criminal activity and stated \nthe offenses show \u201can isolated incident of lack of judgment, if the accusations were \ntrue.\u201d At his hearing, Applicant adamantly denied having any kind of intimate contact or \nsexual relations with the subordinate.10 After reviewing all the evidence, including the \nrecord of trial of his court-martial, I find Applicant did commit adultery by having sexual \nintercourse with his subordinate. I further find that Applicant was untruthful when he \ndenied committing the conduct. \n \n \nApplicant is very highly regarded by his current employer. He is described as a \nvalued and reliable associate and a man of integrity with high ethical and moral \nstandards. His performance appraisals were very positive. He was recommended for a \nsecurity clearance and an ADP position.11 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n7 GE 8; AE D. \n \n8 GE 1. \n \n9 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n10 Tr. at 50, 73; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5, 6, 8. \n \n11 AE A-C, F, G, K. \n \n\n5 \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n\n6 \n Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant omitted information from his Public Trust Application; however, he had \nalready provided the information through a different questionnaire six days earlier. \nThere is insufficient evidence to find that it was a deliberate omission. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not \napplicable. SOR \u00b6 2.a is concluded for Applicant. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n \n \n \n\n7 \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  \n \nApplicant was convicted at a Special Court-Martial of adultery and violating a \ngeneral order by fraternizing with a subordinate. He denied committing adultery but \nadmitted to conduct that would amount to fraternization and violations of a Military \nProtection Order. This raises both of the above disqualifying conditions. Applicant did \nnot intentionally falsify his Public Trust Application. SOR \u00b6 1.b is concluded for \nApplicant. \n \nFour Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a)-(d) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;  \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nThe conduct that formed the basis of Applicant\u2019s Special Court-Martial occurred \nin 2003. There is no evidence that Applicant was pressured or coerced into committing \nhis criminal acts. His denials that he had a sexual relationship with his subordinate \nconstitute some evidence that he did not commit the offense of adultery. However, I did \nnot find his denials credible. Applicant provided false, incomplete, and misleading \ninformation about his involvement with his female subordinate in statements on January \n29, 2004 and April 9, 2004; in a background interview on June 6, 2007; in his response \nto Interrogatories on June 6, 2007; in his response to the SOR on January 29, 2008; \nand in his hearing testimony on May 28, 2008. While there is some evidence of \nrehabilitation, I cannot find successful rehabilitation without complete candor. I am also \nunable to find that Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. No mitigating \ncondition is completely applicable. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n8 \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant committed criminal \noffenses which ultimately cost him his military career. He has been untruthful about his \ncriminal acts throughout this process, including providing false testimony at his hearing. \nHe has a favorable work record and served honorably for most of his career in the \nMarine Corps. Despite the positive evidence, Applicant\u2019s actions raise serious concerns \nabout his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from his criminal \nconduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n9 \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nEdward W.

He misunderstood the question,\nand therefore, he mitigated the Personal Conduct concerns. Although he has a history of alcohol-\nrelated arrests and has attended court-ordered classes, he has continued to consume alcohol, at times\nto intoxication, from approximately 1983 to at least 2002. Applicant's failure to mitigate his\nexcessive alcohol consumption raises security concerns. Clearance is denied.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nThe government submitted five items in support of its contention.\n2\nItem 4 (Applicant's Security Clearance Application (SF 86), dated August 31, 2005 ) at 1-20.\n3\nItem 5 (Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) records, dated November 17, 2006) at 1-2.\n4\nId.\n5\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 21, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to\nApplicant Statements of Reasons (SOR) stating it was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence the\n1\nadministrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct), of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December\n29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised\nguidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nIn a sworn statement, dated December 11, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations\nand elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel\nsubmitted the government's written case on February 14, 2007, and provided a complete copy of the\nfile of relevant material (FORM)  to Applicant, along with notice of his opportunity to file objections\n2\nand submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions. Applicant received\nthe FORM on March 6, 2007. Applicant submitted additional information. The case was assigned\nto me on March 28, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations pertaining to alcohol consumption under Guideline\nG (subparagraphs 1.a through 1.e). He denied the factual allegations pertaining to personal conduct\nunder Guideline E (subparagraph 2.a). Those admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. In\naddition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is 47 years old and is a sheet metal worker for a defense contractor. He has been\nwith his current employer since 1979. Applicant is single and has no children. He submitted a\nsecurity clearance application on August 31, 2005.3\nApplicant admits consuming alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from\n1983 to at least November 2006. Between 1983 and 1989, he was arrested three times and charged\nwith driving while intoxicated (DWI). After each of those arrests, he attended a court ordered\nAlcohol Safety Action Program (ASAP).   His driver's license was revoked.\n4\n5\n\nItem 3 (Applicant's notarized answer, dated December 11, 2006 and January 8, 2007) at 1-4. \n6\nItem 4, supra note 3, at 19.\n7\nItem 3, supra note 6, at 3.\n8\n4\nIn November 2002, Applicant was again arrested and charged with being drunk in public. He\nwas convicted and required to pay a fine and fee. Applicant continues to drink approximately 18\nbeers per week. 6\nApplicant completed and signed a security clearance application (SF 86) on August 31, 2005.\nSection 23 (d) on the SF 86 asks: Your Police Record. In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for\ncharged with, or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs. (Leave out traffic fines of less\nthan $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related). Applicant answered \"yes\" to that\nquestion, but did not disclose his three DWI convictions.7\nIn his answer to the SOR, he denied intentionally providing false information. He explained\nthat he believed if you had convictions older than ten years, you did not need to list them. He did list\nhis 2002 drunk in public charge on the application form and checked alcohol and drugs. He\nexplained that he answered the section 23 questions a through f to the best of his knowledge. He also\nexplained that he was not convicted of a felony, and thus, did not answer \"yes\" to that question. He\nacknowledged that he did not deliberately leave out the alcohol convictions in the 1980s.8\nApplicant has not presented any information concerning counseling for alcohol or any\ntreatment. There is no record in the evidence of any diagnosis. He continues to drink, as noted above,\nbut not to the same excess as the past.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in\nthe evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline,\nthe adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny\nor revoke an individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions)\nand those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual's eligibility for access\nto classified information (Mitigating Conditions).\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules\nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when applied\nin conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section\nE2.2., Enclosure 2, of the Directive are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair\nand impartial commonsense decisions.\nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\"whole person concept,\" all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. The Adjudicative\nProcess factors which an administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\n\nThe Directive, as amended by Change 4, dated April 20, 1999, uses 'clearly consistent with the national\n9\ninterest\" (Sec. 2.3; Sec.2.5.3; Sec 3.2.; and Sec. 4.2.; Enclosure 3, Sec. E3.1.1.; Sec. E3.1.2.; Sec. E3.1.2.5.; Sec.\nE3.1.2.6.; and Sec. E3.1.2.7.), \"clearly consistent with the interests of national security\" (Enclosure 2, Sec. E2.2.3.); and\n\"clearly consistent with national security\" (Enclosure 2, Sec. E2.2.2.).\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at 2.\n10\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Para E3.1.15.\n11\nDirective, Enclosure 2, Para. E2.2.2\n12\n5\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's  age and maturity at\nthe time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \"clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security\" or \"clearly consistent with the national interest.\"9\nFor the purposes herein, despite the different wording in each, I have concluded all of the standards\nare the same. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,\nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences that are grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the\ngovernment to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified\ninformation.  If the government meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the\n10\napplicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to\novercome the doubts raised by the government\u2019s case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant\u2019s clearance.11\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. Because of this special relationship, the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom\nit grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect\nor safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Any\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved\nin favor of national security.12\nOne additional comment is worthy of note. Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are\nnot at issue in these proceedings. Section 7 of the Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that\nindustrial security clearance decisions shall be, \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Security clearance decisions cover\n\n6\nmany characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. Nothing in this\ndecision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express\nor implied decision as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in\nthe SOR. For clarity, I will discuss each guideline separately.\nAlcohol Consumption\nThe government established its case under Guideline G. Applicant's admitted consumption\nof alcohol to excess and at times to intoxication spans a period of twenty years. Excessive alcohol\nconsumption raises security concerns because it often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment\nor the failure to control impulses, thus raising questions about an individual's reliability and\ntrustworthiness. Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) AG \u00b6 22 (a) ( alcohol-related incidents away from\nwork, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace,\nor other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser\nor alcohol dependent) applies in this case.\nThe record evidence and Applicant's admissions show he was arrested three times between\n1983 and 1989, and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. After each arrest, he was\ndirected to enroll in an alcohol safety awareness program. His driver's license was revoked. In 2002,\nhe was arrested and convicted of being drunk in public. He was fined and found guilty. Applicant\nadmits he continues to drink a large amount of alcohol on a weekly basis.\nWhen the Government's initial burden has been met and a disqualifying condition raised, the\nburden shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation, or mitigation,\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case. Here Applicant offered no such\ninformation to rebut or mitigate the allegations of the disqualifying conduct under Guideline G in the\nSOR. After a review of the Guideline G mitigating conditions, I find that none apply to the facts of\nthis case. \nPersonal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b616 (a) (deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefit status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or\n\n7\naward fiduciary responsibilities) is raised. Applicant did not disclose the three DWI's on the form,\ndespite the fact that he answered yes to the question concerning alcohol related offenses. He did list\nthe 2002 charge for public drunkenness. He denied that he did this with intent to deceive.\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the burden of\nproving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant's state of\nmind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a\nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant's state\nof mind at the time the omission occurred. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17,\n2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02- 23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004).\nApplicant's explanation  was credible that he did not disclose the earlier DWIs because  he\nmisunderstood the question. He had already responded yes to the question. The last part of the\nquestion (f) referred to the last 7 years for anything that was not already mentioned. I find his\nexplanation that he misunderstood the question reasonable. I do not find that he intentionally\nfalsified his security clearance application.\nThe issue before me is whether he has presented sufficient evidence of extenuation,  or\nmitigation to warrant a favorable conclusion. I find that the Applicant has presented such information\nand mitigated the government's concerns under Guideline E. \nWhole Person \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. As noted above, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in\nconsidering the whole person concept. It recognizes a person be viewed by the totality of his or her\nacts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits,\ntaking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.\nI considered both the record evidence and Applicant in light of the whole-person concept.\nApplicant began consuming alcohol to excess many years ago. As a result, he has had three arrests\nand convictions. In 2002, he had a public drunkenness conviction. He admits still drinking.  I must\ndecide whether favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable or vice versa. I have evaluated\nApplicant's conduct under the whole person concept of the Directive. I conclude that Applicant has\nneither rebutted nor mitigated the security concerns raised by the alcohol consumption allegations\nin the SOR, and he has not demonstrated that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nhim a security clearance. Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n              Formal Findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n8\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:           \nAgainstApplicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E.\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

He has an extensive amount of\ndelinquent debts, including unpaid judgments, and unpaid state and federal taxes. Applicant failed\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive).\nItem 1 at 1, 7, 16, 17; Item 2 at 1-3.\n2\nItem 1 at 20; Item 2 at 3; Item 7. Applicant\u2019s security clearance application states he served in the Navy until\n3\nMay 1991, and provides his rank as a first class petty officer (E-6). The DON CAF documents reflect that Applicant was\na third class petty officer (E-4) in July 1990. The adverse information in the above paragraph is not considered for\n2\nto file his federal tax returns for tax years 1995 through 2001, and intentionally provided false\ninformation on a security clearance application. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On September 11, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons1\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 12, 2006, and elected to have the case decided\non the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written\ncase on February 27, 2007. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided\nto Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions. Applicant received the FORM on March 6, 2007.\nHis response was due April 6, 2007. As of April 30, 2007, he had not responded. The case was\nassigned to me on May 2, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is divorced and has a 20-\nyear-old son and a 20-year-old daughter. He has an associate\u2019s degree.  \n2\nApplicant served in the U.S. Navy from 1982 to May 1991.

Applicant failed to file his federal tax returns for tax years 1995\nthrough 2001. On April 22, 2004, the Internal Revenue Service filed a federal tax lien against\nApplicant in the amount of $76,044. Applicant stated he pays $533 per month to satisfy this debt,\nbut provided no supporting documentation. The credit bureau report (CBR) of February 22, 2007,\nstill lists the tax lien of $76,044.  \n4\nApplicant admitted to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, in the amount of $453. He stated it was a shared\ndebt prior to his divorce, his spouse created the debt and did not pay, and that he was unaware the\ndebt still existed. Applicant stated he would satisfy the debt. The CBR of February 22, 2007, still\nlists the debt.  \n5\nApplicant admitted to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, in the amount of $855. He stated it was a\n\u201c[d]ivorce dilemma,\u201d that the debt is currently being satisfied at the rate of $42 per month, and that\nthe debt will be satisfied in four months. The CBR of February 15, 2005, lists the debt with a balance\nof $1,705. The CBR of August 24, 2006, lists this debt with a balance of $855. The debt does not\nappear on the CBR of February 22, 2007.  I find this debt has been paid.\n6\nApplicant admitted to the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.i, in the total amount of\napproximately $13,750. He stated each debt was a \u201c[d]ivorce dilemma,\u201d and that he would make\narrangements to satisfy the debts. No further evidence was presented.  \n7\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f, is for past due child support in the amount of $612. Applicant denied\nthis debt and stated his child support balance is zero. He provided a number to call, but no supporting\ndocumentation. The CBR of February 22, 2007, still lists this debt with a balance of $612. The CBR\nalso lists a separate child support account as \u201cclosed or paid account/zero balance.\u201d It is unclear if\nthey refer to child support accounts for the same child or for different children.  \n8\nApplicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h, in the amount of $436. He stated he was unaware\nof this debt, and that he was attempting to contact the creditor, but was unsuccessful. The debt is\n\nItem 4; Item 8 at 4; Items 9-10.\n9\nItem 4.\n10\nItem 4; Item 5 at 3.\n11\nItem 4; Item 6.\n12\nItems 1, 2, 4.\n13\nItem 2 at 5; Item 4.\n14\nItem 2 at 5; Item 4; Item 5 at 1.\n15\n4\nlisted on the CBR of February 15, 2005. The CBRs of August 24, 2006 and February 22, 2007, do\nnot list this debt.9\nApplicant admitted to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j, in the amount of $1,414. He stated that he would\npay the debt. No further evidence was presented.   \n10\nA state tax lien was filed against Applicant in February 1996, in the amount of $5,857, as\nreflected in SOR \u00b6 1.k. Applicant has not lived in that state in a number of years. He stated he would\nresearch the debt and resolve accordingly. No further information or documentation was submitted.11\nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n, are three judgments entered against Applicant in 1994\nand 1995, in the total amount of approximately $416. Applicant denied knowing about these debts.\nHe stated he would contact the creditors and satisfy the balances. No further information or\ndocumentation was submitted.  \n12\nApplicant utilized an electronic personnel security questionnaire worksheet to submit an\nelectronic security clearance application (SF-86). The SF-86 in the case file is unsigned, but\nindicated Applicant signed the form on December 16, 2004. A release of information attached to the\nSF-86 was signed by Applicant on December 16, 2004. Applicant refers to the SF-86 in his response\nto the SOR.  I find that Applicant did submit the information on the SF-86, as contained in Item 2.\n13\nApplicant answered \u201cNO\u2019\u201d to all the pertinent financial questions on the SF-86. Question 35\nof the SF-86 asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had any property repossessed for any reason?\u201d In\nhis response to the SOR, Applicant stated that the creditor told him that voluntarily turning in his\nvehicle due to a divorce would not count against him as a repossession.  I find no intentional\n14\nfalsification of this question.\nQuestion 36 of the SF-86 asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had a lien placed against your\nproperty for failing to pay taxes or other debts?\u201d Applicant stated he did not have the federal tax lien\nin December 2004, when the SF-86 was submitted. The tax lien was filed in April 2004, before the\nSF-86 was submitted, but there is no evidence that Applicant was notified or served a copy of the\ntax lien.  I find no intentional falsification of this question.\n15\nQuestion 37 of the SF-86 asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had any judgments against you\nthat have not been paid?\u201d Applicant stated he was unaware of the judgments reflected in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l,\n\nItem 2 at 5; Item 4; Item 6.\n16\nItem 2 at 5; Item 4.\n17\nItem 2 at 5; Item 4.\n18\nDepartment of the Navy v.

The judgments were ordered\nin 1994 and 1995, more than seven years before Applicant submitted his SF-86 in December 2004.16\nI find no intentional falsification of this question.\nQuestion 38 of the SF-86 asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent\non any debt(s)?\u201d Question 39 asked, \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d\nApplicant admitted he had valid delinquent debts at the time.  I find Applicant intentionally falsified\n17\nthese two questions.\nApplicant answered \u201cNO\u201d to Question 32 of the SF-86, which asked, \u201cTo your knowledge\nhave you ever had a clearance or access authorization denied, suspended, or revoked, or have you\never been debarred from government employment? (Note: An administrative downgrade or\ntermination of a security clearance is not a revocation.)\u201d In his response to the SOR, Applicant stated\nhe was well aware of his security clearance suspension while in the Navy, but that directions were\ngiven to go back seven years. Applicant\u2019s security clearance suspension occurred in 1990, more than\nseven years before the SF-86. Unlike some of the questions, this question asked, \u201chave you ever,\u201d\nvice \u201c[I]n the last 7 years.\u201d The question is straight forward, and there is no indication that Applicant\nhad difficulty understanding any other question. Applicant\u2019s \u201cseven year\u201d argument is rebutted by\nhis response to the previous question, which asked, \u201cHas the United States Government ever\ninvestigated your background and/or granted you a security clearance?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cYES,\u201d\nand listed a secret clearance from 1983.  Applicant should not have responded affirmatively to this\n18\nquestion if he thought he was only required to go back seven years. I find Applicant intentionally\nfalsified Question 32 of the SF-86.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n19\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n20\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n21\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\n\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n22\nId.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n23\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n24\n6\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n22\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n23\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n24\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds. \nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), and FC DC 19(g) (failure to file annual federal, state, or local income tax returns as\nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same) apply in this case. Applicant accumulated substantial\ndelinquent debt going back more than ten years. He did not file his federal tax returns for six years.\nHe did not pay all his federal and state taxes, resulting in liens of $76,044 and $5,857.\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\n\n7\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control), FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts), and FC MC 20(e) (the individual\nhas a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence\nof actions to resolve the issue).\nApplicant has made payments on a few of the debts. The great majority of the money is still\nowed. Applicant blamed several of the debts on his divorce and ex-wife, but does not explain why\nthat would constitute a condition that was largely beyond his control. There is also no evidence that\nhe acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has not shown a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, and there is no clear indication that the problem is\nbeing resolved or is under control. I do not find any of the mitigating conditions applicable. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant\u2019s intentional falsification of his security clearance application raises two Personal\nConduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC). They are PC DC 16(a) (deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities) and PC DC 16(e) (personal conduct, or concealment of\ninformation about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal,\nprofessional, or community standing . . . ).\nI have considered all the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) and I especially\nconsidered PC MC 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts), PC MC 17(b) (the refusal or\nfailure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly contributed to by\nimproper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the\nindividual specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made aware of the\nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully),\nPC MC 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent,\nor it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), PC MC 17(d) (the individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive\nsteps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or\n\n8\nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur), and PC MC 17(e) the\nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation,\nor duress). Applicant has not submitted sufficient credible information to establish any of the\nmitigating conditions.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered every finding of fact and\nconclusion discussed above. \nApplicant has a long history of shirking his financial responsibilities. He failed to file his\nfederal income tax returns for six years, and did not pay his federal and state taxes, and many other\ndebts. He intentionally provided false information on his security clearance application. I also\nconsidered Applicant\u2019s military service.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\nbased on his financial issues and personal conduct.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On November 21, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings under subparagraphs 1 (b) through (m) and 1 (o); and subparagraph 3 (a) of\n1\nthe SOR are not at issue in this appeal.  \n\u201cQ: . . . The reason for your separation from the Navy . . . were you administratively separated? . . . A: Yes,\n2\nsir.  I was charged with a positive drug ID in the urinalysis, which I took to a hearing . . . And at the hearing, it was shown\nthat there was misconduct, but I was separated with a under honorable conditions character.  Q: A general discharge\nunder honorable conditions?  A: Yes, sir.\u201d  Tr. at 53-54.  \nThe theft of the exhaust system was not alleged in the SOR.  The Judge stated that he would consider this\n3\noffense, along with the drug involvement for which Applicant was discharged from the Navy, for the limited purpose\nof evaluating whether Applicant had established any mitigating conditions.  \n2\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On May\n31, 2007, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Michael J. Breslin denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in failing to mitigate\nthe Guideline F, J, and E security concerns.   Finding no error, we affirm.\n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:  Applicant enlisted in the Navy after\nhigh school, serving as an electronics technician.  While in the Navy, unit tax representatives\nprepared his tax returns.  Unknown to him, state returns for tax years 1999 and 2001 were never\nfiled.  His home state filed a notice of lien for unpaid taxes.  \u201c[H]e recently reached an agreement\nwith the state to pay $2,025.92 for both tax years at the rate of $200.00 a month.\u201d  Decision at 3.\nApplicant was administratively discharged from the navy for misconduct (drug abuse) in\n2003.   As a consequence, the government sought reimbursement for a reenlistment bonus by taking\n2\na portion of Applicant\u2019s income tax refunds.  As of the date of the decision, this debt was in the\namount of $11,787.00. \nIn September 2000, Applicant, during a period of leave, visited a friend who was an\nautomobile mechanic.  Applicant and the friend stole four rims and tires from a vehicle at an\nautomobile dealership, installing them on Applicant\u2019s car.  The next day, the two stole a dual exhaust\nsystem from a car.  He stored the contraband in his car, which he parked at his parent\u2019s home.  When\nthe thefts were discovered, Applicant\u2019s parents made restitution to the owners.   \n3\nWhen Applicant filled out his security clearance application, one of the questions was\nwhether he had ever had any judgements against him that had not been paid.  He did not mention the\ntax lien filed by his state.  \nApplicant has not challenged the Judge\u2019s findings.  Therefore, they are not at issue in this\nappeal.  Furthermore, we have considered the Judge\u2019s analysis of the various mitigating conditions\nin light of the record as a whole.  He concluded that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by\nhis own misconduct, therefore precluding application of Financial Consideration Mitigating\n\n\u201c[T]he conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and the\n4\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances . . . \u201d\nFinancial Consideration Mitigating Condition 20(c): \u201c[T]he person has received or is receiving counseling for\n5\nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or in under control. . .\u201d\nSee Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 32(d): \u201c[T]here is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including\n6\nbut not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity . . .\u201d  Applicant argues, inter alia, that he\nwas coerced into committing the criminal misconduct addressed in the SOR.  We have examined the record, which\nincludes, a written statement by Applicant describing the offense.  Although Applicant\u2019s friend apparently suggested the\ntheft, there is no basis in the record to conclude that Applicant was other than a willing participant.  The Board finds no\nreason to disturb the Judge\u2019s decision.  See Government Exhibit 2, at 5-6.  \n3\nCondition 20(b).   Furthermore, the Judge noted that Applicant has not sought financial counseling,\n4\nwhich might otherwise mitigate a bad credit report.   The Judge also concluded that Applicant\u2019s\n5\nuncharged misconduct precluded mitigating the Guideline J security concern.   Furthermore, he\n6\nstated that he had considered all the Guideline E mitigating factors and concluded that none applied.\nDecision at 9.  \nIn arriving at these conclusions, the Judge weighed the evidence offered by Applicant against\nthe length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of\nthe relevant mitigating conditions, deciding in Applicant\u2019s favor on a substantial number of\nallegations.  Furthermore, he articulated a rational basis for his conclusion that Applicant had not\nmitigated those security concerns reflected in his adverse formal findings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-\n12532 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2007).   See also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v.\nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

He continued to ignore these debts even after he obtained\nemployment with a defense contractor and was in a position to pay them.  He finally paid most of\nthe overdue debts and negotiated repayment agreements for the remaining obligations only after the\ninitiation of this action.  He falsified his security clearance application by failing to list several debts\nthat were more than 90 days delinquent.  Applicant also has a history of criminal conduct: the theft\nof four automobile tires and rims in 2000.  I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security\nconcerns arising from his history of financial difficulties, criminal conduct, and personal conduct.\nClearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant submitted an SF 86, Security Clearance Application, originally signed on October\n30, 2003, and re-executed on June 3, 2004, and December 15, 2004.  The Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant under\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), (the \u201cDirective\u201d), as amended by the new administrative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and implemented for the Department of\nDefense on September 1, 2006.  On November 21, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision: security concerns under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations, Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, of the new\nadjudicative guidelines.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing by letter dated December 20, 2006.  He elected to\nhave a hearing before an administrative judge.\nThe case was originally assigned to another judge, but was reassigned to me on March 12,\n2007.  With the concurrence of Applicant and Department Counsel, I convened the hearing on April\n3, 2007.  The government introduced Exhibits 1 through 5.  Applicant provided Exhibit A (a\ncollection of numerous documents), and testified on his own behalf.  DOHA received the final\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 12, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn his Answer to the SOR dated December 20, 2006, Applicant denied the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6\n1.m, 3.a, and 3.b, and admitted the remaining allegations in the SOR.  After a complete and thorough\nreview of the evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant was born in December 1980.  (Ex. 1 at 1.)  After high school, he enlisted in the\nU.S. Navy and entered active duty in September 1998.  (Ex. 1 at 4.)  After basic training, he received\nadvanced instruction in electronics.  He received a security clearance in September 1998, and served\nas an electronics technician aboard ship.  (Id. at 2.)  \nIn May 2002, he qualified as an Enlisted Surface Warfare Specialist.  He received the\nNational Defense Service Medal, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, the Sea Service Medal,\n\n3\nthe Sea Service Deployment Ribbon (with device) and the Navy E Ribbon.  (Ex. A, Character\nLetters.)  He was eventually promoted to petty officer third class (E-4.)  \nWhile in the Navy, Applicant took advantage of the base tax preparation program, whereby\nunit tax representatives prepared state and federal tax returns for service members and filed them\nelectronically.  (Tr. at 31-32.)  According to Applicant, his federal returns were filed, but\u2013unknown\nto him\u2013his state returns for 1999 and 2001 were never filed.  (Tr. at 31-32.)  In 2002, he received\nnotice from his state that his taxes were overdue.  (Tr. at 32.)  The state filed a notice of lien for\nunpaid taxes, but did not sue Applicant  in court.  (Tr. at 34-37; Ex. 3 at 2.)  He has since calculated\nand filed his return for 1999; he is planning on submitting the return for 2001 soon.  (Tr. at 33-34.)\nIn any event, he recently reached an agreement with the state to pay  $2,025.92 for both tax years,\nat the rate of $200.00 each month.  (Ex. A, Item 1.n.)  \nIn September 2000, Applicant  went on leave to visit a friend who was a fellow automobile-\nenthusiast.  (Ex. 2 at 5.)  At the friend\u2019s suggestion, they stole four rims and tires from a vehicle at\nan automobile dealership, and later installed them on Applicant\u2019s car.  (Id. at 6.) \nThe next day, Applicant and his friend stole a dual exhaust system from another vehicle;\nApplicant kept one of the mufflers from the system for his car.  (Id.)  He later stored his car with the\nstolen items at his parents home.  The criminal investigation led to Applicant; he signed a written\nconfession on October 30, 2000.  (Id.; Tr. at 38-39.)  According to Applicant, neither the state nor\nthe Navy prosecuted him for the offenses.  (Tr. at 39.)  His parents threw away the stolen property,\nthen later made restitution to the owners.  (Tr. at 39-40, 57-58.)\nIn about 2003, Applicant accepted a Selective Re-enlistment Bonus (SRB) of about\n$14,000.00 for re-enlisting in the U.S. Navy.  (Tr. at 22-23.)  Shortly thereafter, he was\nadministratively separated for misconduct (drug abuse), and given a General (Under Honorable\nConditions) Discharge.  (Tr. at 53-54.)  As a result, the U.S. government claimed reimbursement for\nthe SRB.  Over the years, the U.S. took funds from Applicant\u2019s tax refunds in partial payment of the\ndebt.  (Tr. at 23.) \nAt the time of his separation from the Navy, Applicant was delinquent on several debts,\nincluding his overpaid SRB (SOR, \u00b6 1.a), a bill for telephone services (SOR, \u00b6 1.b), his military\ncredit card (SOR, \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.h), and other debts.  He was unemployed for about 45 days, but received\nthe benefit of accumulated leave, and worked on the side installing automotive equipment.  (Tr. at\n60.)  He did not seek financial counseling.  (Tr. at 61.)  \nIn June 2003, Applicant began working as an electronics maintenance technician for a\ndefense contractor.  (Ex. 1 at 2.)  In October 2003, he completed an SF 86, Security Clearance\nApplication in an electronic format.  (Tr. at 45.)  Question 37 of the SF 86 asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years,\nhave you had any judgments against you that have not been paid?\u201d  Applicant answered \u201cNo.\u201d  (Ex.\n1 at 7.)  Question 38 inquired about debts over 180 days delinquent within the preceding 7 years, and\nApplicant listed three accounts, including the debts listed in SOR, \u00b6 1.f (also \u00b6 1.i), \u00b6 1.d, and 1.h.\n(Ex. 1 at 7-8.)  On the form, he included account numbers and the addresses of the creditors.  (Id.)\nQuestion 39 was \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt?\u201d  Applicant answered\n\u201cNo.\u201d  (Ex. 1 at 8.)  \n\n4\nApplicant testified he did not list the three debts again in response to Question 39 (over 90\ndays) because he felt it was a duplication of the preceding query.  (Tr. at 44.)  He also testified that\nthe debts he listed were the only obligations he could remember.  (Tr. at 43-44.)  He acknowledged\nthat during that time, some creditors were actively pursuing collection, by sending him e-mail\nmessages.  (Tr. at 44.)  He also received regular notices from the government that his SRB\noverpayment was due.  (Tr. at 52-53.)  He admitted he was \u201cfiscally irresponsible\u201d and was throwing\naway some of the delinquency notices.  Therefore, he claims, he did not have the required\ninformation about the debts to provide for the application.  (Tr. at 45.)  \nOn October 30, 2003, Applicant signed a printed copy of his Security Clearance Application,\ncertifying that it was true, complete, and correct.  (Ex. 1 at 8.)  Thereafter, he was required to review\nthe form and re-execute it on June 3, 2004, and December 15, 2004.  (Id.)  Applicant did not add any\nadditional information about any delinquent debts, claiming it did not occur to him.  (Tr. at 46.)  He\nasserted his omissions were not intentional, rather they were simply an oversight on his part.  (Ex.\nA, Item 3.b.)  \nIn about 2004, he was involved in a motor vehicle accident.  The insurance company would\nhave covered the cost of repair of his vehicle.  However, Applicant took the occasion to do more\nextensive renovations to his car, and fell behind on the car loan payments.  (Tr. at 25-26; Ex. A, Item\n1.c.)  In March 2007, after the initiation of this action, Applicant negotiated a settlement, and\nresolved the debt.  (Ex. A, Item 1.c at 1.)  \nIn April 2004, the military exchange notified Applicant that they had taken part of his federal\ntax return to satisfy his outstanding debt on his military charge accounts.  (Ex. A, Item 1.d at 1, 3.)\nAfter the initiation of this action, Applicant negotiated an agreement with the government\nto repay the SRB, beginning in April 2007.  (Tr. at 23.)  He also paid many of the outstanding\nobligations.  His current credit reports reflect his resolution of almost all his previously delinquent\ndebts.  (Ex. A, Credit Reports.)  The current status of the debts listed in the SOR is shown below.\nSOR\nAccount/Amount\nStatus\nEvidence\n1.a\nDFAS              $11,787.00\nUnpaid-\nRepayment\nagreement\nTr. at 22; Ex.

The company\u2019s vice president\ndescribed him as skilled, professional, and trustworthy, and recommends him for a position of trust.\n(Ex. A, Character Letters, at 1.)  His project manager indicated Applicant is reliable and trustworthy,\nand a valuable asset to the company and the government.  (Id. at 2.)  Supervisors and co-workers\npraise his technical skill, professional demeanor, and reliability at work.  (Id. at 3, 4.)  Applicant\u2019s\nperformance ratings are very positive.  (Ex. A, Employee Evaluations.)\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 527 (1988).)  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry\n(Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified\ninformation within the executive branch.  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his\ndesignee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  (Exec. Ord. 10865, \u00a7 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines\ncontained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as\nwell as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline. \n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d  (AG, \u00b6 2(a).)  An\nadministrative judge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the\navailable, reliable information about the person.  (Id.)  An administrative judge should consider the\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\n\n6\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness\nof participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;\n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress;\nand (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  (Id.) \nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify an applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.\n(Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.)  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  (Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.)  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\nsecurity clearance.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).)  \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d  (Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.) \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  (Exec. Ord. 10865, \u00a7\n7.)  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case are Guideline F, Financial Considerations,\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, as set forth in the new\nadjudicative guidelines promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and implemented by\nthe Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  Conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these\nadjudicative guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.  I considered carefully\nall the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I reach the following conclusions\nregarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set out in \u00b6 18\nof the new adjudicative guidelines.  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. \n\n7\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under \u00b6 19(a), an\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly, under  \u00b6 19(c),\n\u201ca history of nor meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security concerns.  The evidence shows\nApplicant has a long history of failing to meet his financial obligations.  He was unable or unwilling\nto pay a large number of debts for many years, until after the initiation of this action.  The evidence\nraises these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised\nunder this guideline.  Paragraph 20(a) may apply where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d   The behavior in question\nis the non-payment of debts.  Applicant  resolved most of the delinquent debts only recently; some\nare still unpaid.  Moreover, there were many overdue accounts over many years; therefore the\nconduct was not infrequent.  The available evidence does not raise this mitigating condition.\nUnder \u00b6 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s financial problems arose because he was\nfinancially irresponsible, and because of his own misconduct, resulting in his early separation from\nthe Navy and the loss of his SRB.  I find this mitigating condition does not apply.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d is potentially mitigating\nunder \u00b6 20(c).  Applicant has not sought or obtained financial counseling; therefore, this is not a\nfactor for consideration. \nParagraph 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  Applicant resolved almost all of the debts\nlisted on the SOR, has negotiated agreements to repay the federal government for the SRB and the\nstate for the tax bill.  I conclude this potentially mitigating factor applies.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nParagraph 30 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern relating to\ncriminal conduct: \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules and regulations.\u201d\nThe adjudicative guidelines set out certain conditions that could raise security concerns.\nParagraph 31(a) provides that \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d may be\ndisqualifying.  Similarly, under \u00b6 31(c), an \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless\nof whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted,\u201d may raise security\nconcerns.  The evidence reveals that Applicant participated in the theft of tires and rims from a car\ndealership in September 2000, even though he was never formally charged with the crime.  This\nevidence of a serious crime is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n\n8\nThe available evidence also indicates Applicant was involved with the theft of an exhaust\nsystem the following day, and with a drug offense in 2003.  Neither of these incidents were included\nas allegations in the SOR, therefore I will not consider this evidence as a basis for a potentially\ndisqualifying condition.  The additional evidence may be relevant, however, on the issue of whether\nApplicant has established a potentially mitigating condition.  \nThe adjudicative guidelines also set out some potentially mitigating conditions under\nGuideline J.  Under \u00b6 32(a), it may be mitigating where \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal\nbehavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt upon the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  The theft\noffense occurred in 2000, when Applicant was 19 years old, and he was prompted by others to steal\nthe automotive parts.  About seven years have elapsed since the offense alleged in the SOR, and\nApplicant is no longer in similar circumstances.  However, considering the additional evidence of\nApplicant\u2019s other crimes, I conclude Applicant has failed to meet his burden of persuasion that his\ncriminal behavior is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt upon his reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment.  I conclude this potentially mitigating condition does not apply.\nParagraph 32(d) indicates it may be mitigating where \u201cthere is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal\nactivity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\u201d  Applicant presented some evidence of rehabilitation,\nincluding his good employment record.  Also, his family made restitution for the stolen automobile\nparts.  However, I also considered the evidence of additional criminal behavior for the limited\npurpose of determining whether Applicant has established a mitigating condition.  There is evidence\nof additional crimes; moreover, his most recent criminal conduct occurred in 2003, which is\ncomparatively recent.  I conclude Applicant has failed to establish this potentially mitigating factor.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to Guideline E, Personal Conduct, is set out in \u00b6 15 of the new\nadjudicative guidelines.\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\nOf special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process. \nParagraph 16(a) provides that it may be disqualifying where the evidence reveals \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire\n. . . or similar form used to . . . determine security clearance eligibility . . . .\u201d  Paragraph 3.a of the\nSOR alleges Applicant falsified his answer to Question 37 regarding unpaid judgments by not\nreporting the state tax lien.  However, the term \u201cjudgment\u201d refers to the decision or ruling of a court,\nwhile a \u201clien\u201d is a claim or charge against property.  There is no evidence that the lien filed by the\nstate for the unpaid taxes was ever reduced to a judgment.  I find the evidence relating to this\nallegation does not raise a security concern.\n\n9\nThe SOR, \u00b6 3.b, also alleges that Applicant falsified his response to Question 39 regarding\ndebts over 90 days old by failing to list the 15 debts mentioned in paragraph 1 of the SOR.  I note\nthat in response to the earlier question about debts over 180 days old, Applicant listed the debts in\n\u00b6 1.f (also \u00b6 1.i), \u00b6 1.d, and 1.h of the SOR.  He explained that he did not list them again in response\nto Question 39 because it would have been duplicative.  I conclude Applicant had no intent to\nconceal these debts and that, having been previously listed, any failure to list them a second time was\nnot material.  \nWith regard to the other delinquent debts listed in the SOR, Applicant contended his\nomission was a simple mistake caused by his inattention to his financial situation.  However, I find\nthis representation to be unpersuasive.  He admits he was aware of the substantial debt for the\nunearned SRB and acknowledged receiving repeated notices of the debt.  He also admitted receiving\nother debt notices and simply deleting them or throwing them away.  Applicant obviously had the\ntime to investigate his delinquent debts\u2013he took the time to collect account numbers for the three\ndebts he reported.  Moreover, he was required to certify the accuracy of the answer to this question\nthree times over a period of more than 13 months\u2013certainly long enough to get the requested\ninformation.  I conclude Applicant falsified his answer to Question 39.  This potentially disqualifying\ncondition applies.\nThe new adjudicative guidelines set out several potentially mitigating conditions under the\nguideline for Personal Conduct.  I considered each of them and conclude that none apply.\nThe \u201cWhole Person\u201d Concept\nI carefully considered all the facts and circumstances, including the potentially disqualifying\nand mitigating conditions, in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201dconcept.  As noted above, Applicant has a\nhistory of financial irresponsibility beginning before his discharge from the Navy in 2003.  He\ncontinued to ignore these debts even after he was in a position to pay them.  He finally paid most of\nthe overdue debts, and negotiated repayment agreements for the remaining obligations only after the\ninitiation of this action.  This history calls into question his judgment, self-control, and willingness\nto abide by rules.  Similarly, his history of criminal conduct\u2013specifically the theft offense listed in\nthe SOR\u2013suggests he has little regard for laws and restrictions, and exercises poor judgment.\nConsidering all the available evidence, he failed to mitigate these concerns.  Finally, his recent and\nrepeated falsification of his security clearance application calls into question his ability to follow the\nrules regarding the protection of classified material.  I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns arising from his history of financial difficulties, criminal conduct, and personal\nconduct.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nMy conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\n\n10\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nMichael J.

As she matured, she changed her checking writing\nand bill paying habits. She paid her overdue small debts. Her largest debt is barred by the statute of\nlimitations and cannot be used as a way to pressure, coerce, or exploit her. She is working to resolve\nher remaining debts. She has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns under Guidelines F and J. Since\nshe did not intentionally falsify her answers on the SF-85P form, the government did not establish\na prima facie case under Guideline E. Eligibility is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn August 18, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an\nADP I/II/III position (SF-85P). The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to\ngrant the application under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \u201cDirective\u201d).  On August 30,\n1\n2006, DOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The\nSOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct), Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).\nIn a sworn statement date stamped September 19, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations. She requested a hearing on February 26, 2007. DOHA assigned this case to me on March\n7, 2007, and issued a notice of hearing on March 16, 2007. I conducted the hearing on April 10, 2007.\nThe government submitted seven exhibits (GE), which were marked and admitted into the record as\nGE 1-7 without objection. Applicant submitted 15 exhibits (App Ex), which were marked and\nadmitted as App Ex A-O without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf. I held the record\nopen for Applicant to submit addition evidence, which she did. This evidence has been marked and\nadmitted as App Ex P-AA without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April\n24, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn her SOR response, Applicant admits to subparagraphs 2.b, 2.c, 2.e, 2.f, and 2.i under\nGuideline F in the SOR. She denies the remaining allegations, including intentional falsification.2\nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of\nthe pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.\n\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s questionnaire for a position of public trust, dated August 18, 2004) at 1-3.\n3\nTr. at 27, 64.\n4\nGE 4 (Applicant\u2019s signed sworn statement, dated August 14, 2003 and summary) at 1, 3-4; Tr. at 36-38, 44-47,\n5\n50-53.\nApp Ex J (Warrant and court disposition sheet); App Ex K (Warrant and court disposition sheet); App Ex L\n6\n(Warrant and court disposition sheet); Tr. at 34-37.\n3\nApplicant, a 37-year-old woman and high school graduate who works as a claims associate\nfor a Department of Defense contractor, seeks a position of public trust. She started working for her\nemployer in April 1990.  \n3\nApplicant married eight years ago. She has a 7-year-old son, a 15-year-old stepson, and a 20-\nyear-old stepdaughter, who is in college. Her husband works as a welder. His work hours vary from\nweek to week, depending upon availability. The variability in his work hours impacts his monthly\nincome.4\nApplicant stated that as a young adult, she wrote checks even though she did not know if she\nhad sufficient funds in her bank account. She never kept a record of the checks she wrote or a\ncheckbook. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) criminal record information sheet reflects a\nJune 7, 1996 incident related to a violation of check law. The report contains a case number and a\nreference to two counts of check law violation. The report does not state that Applicant was arrested;\nrather, it reflects either that she was arrested or something was received on June 7, 1996 by the police.\nThe outcome of this incident is not noted in this report. The Applicant had only a vague memory at\nthe hearing about this matter and the facts surrounding it. In her 2003 signed and sworn affidavit, she\noutlined this incident clearly. In 1996, the police arrived at Applicant\u2019s residence and arrested her on\na check law violation. She had written a check, which the payee cashed before her payday. This action\nresulted in insufficient funds to pay other outstanding checks. She paid all the fees on the warrant and\nthe check. The police released her and she heard nothing more from the police or the courts.5\nAlthough not alleged, Applicant provided documentation which reflects that the court issued\nthree warrants, two for check writing incidents in 1999 and one for a check writing incident in 2002.\nThe prosecutor did not file formal charges against her for fraudulent checks. Rather, she demonstrated\nto the magistrate court that she paid the checks and the court administrative costs related to two\nwarrants. The magistrate court entered a finding of not guilty as the disposition for these cases. She\nappeared before a magistrate judge on the third warrant. The complaining party could not produce a\ncopy of the bad check it claimed she wrote; thus, the court found her not guilty and dismissed the\ncharges against her. Applicant has not been involved in any more check writing issues.6\nIn 2002, Applicant purchased a used car. She made the car payments for over two years, but\nwhen she got behind in the payments, the car note holder repossessed the car. She knew the car would\nbe sold and assumed that the funds from the sale of the car would pay her loan in full. She purchased\nanother car shortly thereafter. She made the car payments for several years, but again got behind in\nthe payments and the car was repossessed. She knows that the note holder sold this car. Again, she\nbelieved that the sale of the car eliminated her debt. Two month before the hearing, a lawyer\ncontacted her to settle the unpaid balance on her second car loan. At this time, she learned that the\n\nTr. at 39-43, 43-44.\n7\nApplicant indicated that she only spent $150 a month on groceries for four individuals, which I believe to be\n8\ntoo low. I added an additional estimate of $300 for food into her monthly expenses. App Ex Q (Personal Financial\nStatement, dated May 3, 2007); App Ex T (2004 Federal Income Tax return); App Ex U (2005 Federal Income Tax\nreturn); App Ex V (2006 Federal Income Tax return); App Ex W (2004 State  Income Tax return); App Ex X (2005 State\nIncome Tax return); App Ex Y (2006 State Income Tax return);\nGE 6 (Credit report, dated May 18, 2006); GE 5 (Credit report, dated October 29, 2004); and GE 7 (Credit\n9\nreport, dated January 23, 2007).\n4\nsale of a car after it had been repossessed did not necessarily eliminate her debt. She offered to repay\nher second car debt on a monthly plan. The lawyer, on behalf of his client, has not accepted her offer.7\nApplicant\u2019s gross monthly income totals approximately $2,707. Her net monthly income totals\napproximately $2,065. Her husband\u2019s net monthly income totals approximately $1,800, giving them\na combined net monthly income of $3865.Their monthly expenses approximate $2,400, leaving an\nestimated $1,400 to pay unexpected expenses and debt.8\nA review of Appellant\u2019s credit reports dated October 29, 2004, May 19, 2006, January 23,\n2007, and the SOR shows 10 unpaid debts totaling $13,924. The current status of these debts is as\nfollows:9\nSOR \u00b6\nTYPE OF DEBT (DATE)\nAMOUNT\nCURRENT STATUS\n2.a\nTelephone bill (2002)\n$   312.00\nClosed, resolved, to be\ndeleted from credit report\n2.b\nMoving bill (2002)\n$   118.00\nPaid\n2.c\nTelephone bill (2006)\n$     42.00\nPaid\n2.d\nTelephone bill (October\n2004)\n$1,221.00\nDisputes balance\n2.e\nMedical bill (2000)\n$     32.00\nPaid\n2.f\nCable bill (2001)\n$   164.00\nPaid\n2.g\nReturned check (2002)\n$     53.00\nCriminal court action\ndismissed on grounds of lack\nof proof; not guilty\n2.h\nCar repossession (May\n2002)\n$8,935.00\nUnpaid\n2.I\nCollection account (April\n2002)\n$     87.00\nPaid\n2.j\nCar repossession (September\n2004)\n$2,960.00\nUnpaid, offer for monthly\npayment plan made\n\nApp Ex G (Receipt, dated September 18, 2006); App Ex H (Letter, dated February 21, 2007); App Ex I (Copy\n10\nof money orders for three payments on debts); App Ex K, supra note 5, at 2; App Ex M (Letter, dated April 2, 2007);\nApp Ex P (Receipt, dated May 11, 2007); App Ex S (Current telephone bill); GE 2 (Answers to Interrogatories, dated\nJune 27, 2006) at 3; Tr. at 30-34, 43-44, 54-55.\nTr. at 28-29, 58, 72.\n11\nId. at 70; App Ex A (Trustworthiness determination, dated May 13, 2003); App Ex B(Letters, dated April 5,\n12\n2007 and April 9, 2007); App Ex F (Certificates of Recognition, dated January 10, 2006); App Ex AA (Unsigned\nperformance evaluation for the year 2006).\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  \n13\n5\nApplicant\u2019s oldest and smallest debts are resolved. She disputes the large, unpaid telephone\nbill and has requested information about the basis for the bill, which she has not yet received. She\npays her current telephone bill regularly and timely. Her two largest debts relate to car repossessions.\nShe made an offer to repay the smaller car debt on a monthly basis, but it has not yet been accepted.\nShe now pays cash for most items or uses money orders as a means of payment. While she has a\nchecking account, she uses it only for emergencies.10\nWhen Applicant completed her SF-85P on August 18, 2004, she answered \u201cno\u201d to question\n22b, which asked if she \u201cwas now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation?\u201d She\ndenied falsifying her answer at the hearing, even though she did not list any of her delinquent debts\nidentified in her credit reports. When she read the question, she thought only of her current bills,\nwhich she knew were not delinquent. She did not think about her old bills. I note that two debts listed\nin the SOR became delinquent subsequent to the date she completed her application. At the hearing,\nthe government conceded that this question is poorly written.11\nIn 2003, the Department of Defense granted Applicant a trustworthiness determination. Her\nco-workers describe her as reliable and honest. Her employer rated her at sometimes exceeds\nexpectations in her most recent performance appraisal. The employer noted her ability to work in the\ncompany\u2019s best interest, and in a compliant and ethical manner. A year ago, she received several\ncertificates of recognition from her employer. The record lacks any evidence indicating that she has\nbeen disciplined for violation of rules in the workplace. She has learned from her past financial\nmistakes.12\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n13\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for determining trustworthiness within the executive branch. \nTo be eligible for a trustworthiness determination, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security\nguidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n14\n Id.\n15\n Id.\n16\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n17\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n18\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n19\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n20\n6\nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a trustworthiness determination.  An\n14\nadministrative judge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the\navailable, reliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the\n15\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of\nparticipation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7)\nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.16\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to sensitive information.17\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n18\nwith the national interest to grant eligibility for a position of public trust.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n19\naccess to classified or sensitive information is clearly consistent with national security will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations\n20\nfor access to sensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nPersonal Conduct\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E is always a trustworthiness concern because it asks the\ncentral question does a person's past conduct justify confidence the person can be trusted to properly\nsafeguard classified and/or sensitive information. Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n21\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n7\nof a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a\nsecurity clearance or in other official matters is a trustworthiness concern. It is deliberate if it is done\nknowingly and willfully.\nUnder Guideline E, the government established that Applicant omitted material facts from her\nSF-85P when she answered question 22b. She denies, however, that she deliberately falsified her\nanswer to this question, stating that she only considered her current debts, not debts which were several\nyears old, when answering the question. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the\ngovernment has the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or\nprove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must\nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence\nconcerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.  For Personal\n21\nConduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (The deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . .) to apply,\nthe government must establish that Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in her answer\nwas deliberate. Applicant credibly testified that she only considered the status of her current debts\nwhen answering the question. In light of the government\u2019s concession on the poor quality of this\nquestion, she did not act unreasonably in interpreting the question to means only current debts,not\ndebts in the past. Thus, Applicant did not deliberately falsify her trustworthiness application. The\ngovernment has not established its case under Guideline E.\nFinancial Considerations\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC)\nE2.A6.1.2.1 (A history of not meeting financial obligations), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (Inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) apply to Applicant's case. Applicant had 10 delinquent debts. Although\nshe paid the small debts, the major debts remain unpaid.\nI considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC). I cannot apply FC\nMC E2.A6.1.3.1 (The behavior was not recent), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (The behavior was isolated)\nbecause the majority of her debts remain outstanding, and thus, are recent. She incurred these debts\nover a period of time, not at one point in time. The repossession of one car occurred only a year ago.\nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce, or separation)) has some application. Applicant\u2019s husband works as a welder. Since\nthe availability of work various, his work hours vary as does his income. His fluctuating income can\nimpact their ability to pay all their monthly bills from time to time. Applicant has indicated that her\nhusband\u2019s net monthly income is $1800. In light of his variable work hours, I conclude that this is an\naverage, not an amount guaranteed each month.\nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control) does not apply because\nApplicant has not contacted a credit counseling agency\n\nThe Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue creditors or\n22\notherwise resolve debts:\nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant\nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other\ngood-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term\n\u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that\na person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or\nobligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a\nlegally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition 6. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No.\n99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). In ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999), the Appeal Board\nspecifically addressed application of the statute of limitations, stating a \u201cperson who decides not to honor his or her debts\nmay be able to avoid paying those debts until they are legally uncollectible because the statute of limitations has run.\nReliance on the running of a statute of limitations would be a legally permissible course of action. However, it would\nnot demonstrate a good-faith effort to resolve one\u2019s debts that would fall under the meaning of Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition 6.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 03-10880 (App. Bd. June 24, 2005); ISCR Case No. 01-09691 (App. Bd.\nMar. 27, 2003) (stating an applicant must do more than merely cite the statute of limitations to obtain the full benefit of\nFC MC 6). See also ISCR Case No. 01-09691 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003) (\u201c[E]ven if a delinquent debt is legally\nunenforceable under state law, the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances surrounding\nan applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 98-0349 at 2-3\n(App. Bd. Feb. 3, 1999) (even though an applicant\u2019s delinquent debts were not legally collectible because of the statute\nof limitations, that fact did not preclude the Administrative Judge from considering the applicant\u2019s failure to resolve the\ndelinquent debts before the statute of limitations ran). Cf. ISCR Case No. 01-04425 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 17, 2002)\n(adverse Guideline F conclusions possible where applicant chose not to pay her delinquent debts, waited until her\ncreditors ceased trying to collect those delinquent debts, and they were eventually dropped from her credit report.).\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under FCMC\n23\n6 for debts being resolved through garnishment). \n8\nFC MC E2.1.3.6 (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) has some application. A promise to pay in the future is not sufficient to\nmitigate the financial considerations concern or evidence of a good faith effort to repay debt. Although\nApplicant has indicated an intent to pay her large debts, she has not provided evidence that she has\ntaken concrete steps to resolve her three largest bills. She has paid her small outstanding debts, a factor\nin her favor.22\nShe also receives some credit in the whole person analysis, infra, for the application of her\nstate\u2019s 3-year statute of limitations, which applies to allegations 2.a, 2.b, and 2.e-2.h of the SOR debts.\nSee State Code. Ann. \u00a7 15-3-530.  The Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial\n23\nvalue of application of the statute of limitations:\nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they\nstimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and\nstability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of\nlimitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation.\nSignificantly, statutes of limitations provide potential defendants with certainty that\nafter a set period of time, they will not be ha[led] into court to defend time-barred\nclaims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights.\nStatutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system.\n\n9\nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (Ct. App. 2005) (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted).\nCreditors for Applicant\u2019s five small debts and the first car repossession are barred from\ncollecting these debts under the law. Applicant has paid the five debts despite this fact. Elimination\nof 62% of her delinquent debt load through the statute of limitations has significantly reduced her\npotential vulnerability to improper financial inducements to pay these debts because she is no longer\n\u201cfinancially overextended,\u201d but it does not completely negate her past conduct in not paying her\noutstanding debts.\nCriminal Conduct\nThe government has established its case under Guideline J. Criminal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1. (Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged) and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2. (A single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses) apply. As a teenager and young adult, Applicant wrote checks when she did\nnot have sufficient funds in her checking account, which may be a misdemeanor offense under state\nlaw. On one occasion, the police arrested her for violation of the state\u2019s check law. While not arrested\nagain for this conduct, the court issued several warrants related to her check writing.\nI considered all the Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC). I conclude that CC MC\nE2.A10.1.3.1. (The criminal behavior was not recent); CC MC E2.A10.1.3.5. (Acquittal), and CC MC\nE2.A10.1.3.6. (There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation) apply. The incident, which forms\nthe basis for the only allegation of criminal conduct in the SOR, occurred more than 10 years ago. The\nthree warrants resulted from conduct which occurred over 7 years ago. In addition, the court found\nApplicant not guilty of the conduct alleged in the warrants. Applicant has improved her behavior in\nregards to check writing. No warrants have been issued in over four years. She now pays for most\ngoods with cash or by money order.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant's\ntrustworthiness. With the exception of the two car repossessions, Applicant\u2019s unpaid debts totaled less\nthan $2,000. Because she did not manage her money as a young person, she encountered problems\nwith dishonored checks due to insufficient funds in her account. Upon receipt of notice of a problem,\nshe paid the bills in cash and the occasional court administrative cost. As she has grown older, she has\nlearned from her past experiences with money mismanagement. She pays her current bills in cash or\nby money order, reserving the use of her checking account for emergencies only. She is learning to\n\n10\nmanage her money better. Her monthly expense and income estimates indicate she has sufficient funds\nto develop a payment plan for her old car debts. She is attempting to do so for the smaller and more\nrecent car debt. Since the creditor for the older car debt has no legal right to collect this debt, she\ncannot be coerced, pressured or exploited because this debt is not paid. The fact that the creditor is not\npressuring her indicates an understanding of its legal standing.\nThroughout her 17 years of employment, Applicant has never been disciplined for rules\nviolations. She not only complies with the company rules, she has protected sensitive information as\nrequired. At the hearing, she presented as a hard working individual who had no intent to hide her\nfinancial problems from the government. She had trouble managing her money in the past and\ncontinues to experience some problems now, partially due to the erratic nature of her husband\u2019s work.\nShe paid old debt for which she no longer had legal responsibility. Her assertion that she is working\ntowards resolution of two more bills is credible when considered in light of her acceptance of\nresponsibility for her old debts.\nI have weighed the mitigating factors, the reasons for her debts and her failure to pay her debts,\nher recent efforts to assume responsibility for some of the old debts, her payment of small older debts,\nher past conduct regarding her finances, her change in attitude towards her finances, her compliance\nwith company rules, and her work ethic against her failure to pay her old debts earlier and her\nremaining unpaid bills. I find that the overwhelming weight of the evidence indicates that she is a\nperson of integrity, who is trustworthy. She has not acted nor would she act in a manner which would\nharm her employer or the government. There is little likelihood she would suddenly change her\nbehavior and begin violating the privacy rights of her employer\u2019s clientele. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\n   For Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.j:\n   For Applicant\nParagraph 3. Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\n   For Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the evidence presented in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is granted.\n\n11\nMary E. Henry\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On May 22, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Christopher Graham granted Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness determination.\nDepartment Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his\napplication of the pertinent mitigating conditions; whether the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law; and whether the Judge erred in denying a government\nmotion to amend the SOR.

Since that time, however, Applicant has\namassed numerous other debts, all unpaid at the time of the decision, for such things as bad checks,\ntelephone services, credit cards, and medical bills.

She has been unable to meet her debts under this plan, however.  In February 2007, Applicant\ndecided to file for bankruptcy protection again.\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s findings from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \nDepartment Counsel has not challenged the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  Therefore, they are not\nat issue on appeal.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.A6.1.3.3.\n2\nThe Judge specifically concluded that FCMC 4 (Directive \u00b6 E2.A6.1.3.4: \u201cThe person has received or is\n3\nreceiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol\u201d) and FCMC 6 (Directive \u00b6 D2.A6.1.3.6: \u201cThe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts\u201d) were not applicable to the case.  Decision at 7.  \n3\nThe Appeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a\ntrustworthiness determination if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  Once the government presents evidence raising trustworthiness concerns,\nthe burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors\ndoes not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.\nRather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as\na whole.\u201d  See ADP Case No. 05-12037 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2007).  A trustworthiness\ndetermination must be guided by common sense in light of the record as a whole.  See Directive \u00b6\nE2.2.3.\nThe Judge extended Applicant favorable application of Financial Consideration Mitigating\nCondition (FCMC) 3,  which concerns matters outside an applicant\u2019s control, such as an\n2\n\u201cunexpected medical emergency.\u201d   He noted that Applicant has suffered from hypertension and a\n3\nstroke, which entailed hospitalizations and consequent missed work.  He also noted that Applicant\u2019s\nphysicians have counseled her against obtaining a second job, in order to prevent stress.  In\nevaluating the whole person, the Judge stated that \u201cher financial condition is the result of her\ncontinuing health problems.\u201d  Decision at 7.  He concluded that she is not extravagant and opined\nthat she will pay off her debts in time. \nWe have considered the Judge\u2019s decision, the briefs, and the record evidence.  There is\nsubstantial evidence that Applicant has suffered medical problems.  However, there is a paucity of\nevidence demonstrating a nexus between Applicant\u2019s medical condition and the substantial unpaid\ndebts she has amassed since her previous discharge in bankruptcy, most of which are not for medical\nbills.  Indeed, Applicant testified that her current medical needs account for only $120 of her monthly\nexpenses.  Examining the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole, his conclusion that\nApplicant has met her burden of persuasion is not sustainable, whether viewed in light of FCMC 3\nor of his whole person analysis.  \nConcerning the third assignment of error, the government moved to strike language from the\nSOR.  The Judge denied the motion on the ground that the government had \u201cprovided no legal basis\nfor doing so.\u201d  Decision at 2.  The Judge\u2019s ruling was error.  See ISCR Case No. 04-08547 at 3-4\n(App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2007).  However, this error is harmless, in that it did not affect the outcome of\nthe case.  See ISCR 01-23362 (App. Bd.

She had 23 unpaid debts.  In\n1998, she developed chronic hypertension during a pregnancy, and suffered a stroke after her child\nwas born the following year.  Her high blood pressure has continued, requiring numerous\nhospitalizations, and only in the past six months have the doctors found medication that appears to\ncontrol her hypertension.  She sought credit counseling.  She attempted to follow a budget that\nincluded debt reduction, but could not afford it.  She tried to work a second job but her doctors asked\nher to quit because of her tenuous health situation.  Using the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, she\nsuccessfully mitigated the security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations).\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for assignment to a sensitive position is granted.\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1 (Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P), dated September 23, 2004) at 1-2.\n1\nId. at 2-7.\n2\nItem 5 (Credit Bureau Report, dated May 23, 2006) at 1-3.\n3\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 23, 2004, Applicant submitted a Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P).\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the application under\nDepartment of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, (Jan. 1987), as amended\nand modified (the Regulation), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, modified, and revised\n(the Directive).  DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on August 2, 2006, detailing the basis\nfor its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the\nDirective.  New adjudicative guidelines were issued August 30, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued\nprior to September 1, 2006, DOHA policy requires that this case proceed under the old guidelines.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 20, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before\nan administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on December 15, 2006.  The Notice of\nHearing was issued on December 20, 2006.  I convened a hearing on January 22, 2006, to consider\nwhether Applicant is qualified for a favorable eligibility determination. \nThe government moved to amend the opening paragraph of the SOR, by striking the language\n\u201cparagraph 3-614, Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R and paragraph 2.4.\u201d  The\ngovernment provided no legal basis for changing the guidelines, and I found there was none.  The\nmotion to amend the SOR was denied.  The government offered six exhibits, marked as exhibits 1-6.\nApplicant offered seven exhibits, marked as exhibits A-G.  I left the record open until February 2,\n2007, to allow Applicant the time to submit documentation for the record.  At Applicant\u2019s request\nand without objection by department counsel, I extended that date to February 12, 2007.  On January\n26, 2007 and February 12, 2007, Applicant faxed additional documents to department counsel,\nmarked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits H and I.  The Government had no objection.  Exhibits H and I are\nadmitted.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 31, 2006.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all of the allegations contained in SOR subparagraph 1.a. through 1.y.\nHer admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  I make the following additional findings\nof fact.\nApplicant is a 33-year-old enrollment representative employed by a federal contractor.   She\n1\nis single, has one seven-year-old child living with her, has a high school diploma and one year of\ncollege credits, has not served in the military, and is seeking a renewal of eligibility for assignment\nto an ADP I/II/III position.2\nAs of May 23, 2006, Applicant had the following debts:3\n\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit M (Settlement Agreement, dated February 16, 2006) at 2.\n4\nCurrent Status of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. through 1.x. are all Tr. at 25.\n5\n4\nSOR \u00b6\nDEBTOR\nAMOUNT\nCURRENT STATUS\n1.a.\nBankruptcy\n$20,540\nDischarged in November 20004\n1.b.\nBad check\n$98\nUnpaid5\n1.c.\nCollection account\n$837\nUnpaid\n1.d.\nCharged off\n$1,034\nUnpaid\n1.e.\nCollection account\n$471\nUnpaid\n1.f.\nCollection account\n$332\nUnpaid\n1.g.\nTelephone service\n$129\nUnpaid\n1.h.\nBad check\n$139\nUnpaid\n1.i.\nCollection account\n$1,950\nUnpaid\n1.j.\nJudgment\n$531\nUnpaid\n1.k.\nBad check\n$37\nUnpaid\n1.l.\nCredit card\n$488\nUnpaid\n1.m.\nCredit card\n$461\nUnpaid\n1.n.\nCollection account\n$140\nUnpaid\n1.o.\nCollection account\n$350\nUnpaid\n1.p.\nCell phone\n$473\nUnpaid\n1.q.\nJudgment\n$841\nUnpaid\n1.r.\nBad check\n$129\nUnpaid\n1.s.\nCredit union\n$82\nUnpaid\n1.t.\nDelinquent medical\n$537\nUnpaid\n1.u.\nCollection account\n$473\nUnpaid\n1.v.\nCollection account\n$416\nUnpaid\n1.w.\nBad check\n$540\nUnpaid\n1.x.\nCable television\n$1,383\nUnpaid\n\nApplicant\u2019s Answer, dated September 20, 2006, at 2; Tr. at 24.\n6\nId. at 36.\n7\nTr. at 20.\n8\nId. at 29.\n9\nId. at 29-30.\n10\nId. at 30.\n11\nId. at 31.\n12\nId. at 32.\n13\nId. at 34-35; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B (Debt Management Program, dated August 2006) at 1.\n14\nTr. at 37-38. \n15\nId. \n16\n5\n1.y.\nCredit union\n$213\nDuplicate of 1.s.; balance due: $826\nNot reflected in the SOR is a car loan of $11,000 made by her sister, which Applicant cosigned.  The\nsister is now making the monthly payments.  \n7\nIn the 2000 bankruptcy case, Applicant had about $20,000 of debt discharged.\nApproximately $14,000 of that was for a repossessed car, about $1,500 was credit card debt, and the\nremaining $4,000 debt was her apartment rent.  \n8\nIn 1998, Applicant was pregnant, and during the fifth month of her pregnancy, was\nhospitalized for nearly 2 weeks with severe hypertension.  Since that time, she has been hospitalized\nup to two weeks at a time for that condition, in efforts to find appropriate medications to control her\nblood pressure.  She currently takes four medications for high blood pressure.  She has been seen by\nmany specialists and she has been diagnosed with chronic hypertension.  Her current medication that\nshe has taken for the past six months seems to be working.   She suffered a stroke in 1999, after her\n9\nchild was born.  Residual effects from the stroke affect her left side and left hip which makes it\ndifficult for her to stand up from a sitting position.   Her physician has advised her to only work one\n10\njob due to stress.   She sees her primary physician and a neurologist once a month.   Her doctors\n11\n12\nadvised her that her condition was not severe enough to qualify for social security disability\nbenefits.13\nIn August 2006, Applicant met with a credit counseling service and established a personal\ndebt management program.   She has been unable to make payments toward this program because\n14\nher expenses exceed her income by approximately $500 per month.  Even with her car payment\nbeing completed in the next two months, reducing her payments by $257 per month, she still is in\na deficit position.   Her family is helping her meet her monthly expenses.\n15\n16\n\nId. at 32-33.\n17\nId. at 33-34. \n18\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A (Applicant\u2019s Budget and Expenditures, dated January 1, 2007) at 1-3; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B\n19\n(Applicant\u2019s Personal Debt Management Program, dated August 15, 2006) at 1-2.\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit I (Applicant\u2019s Letter to Administrative Judge, dated February 11, 2007) at 3.\n20\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Her car is a 2001 model which she bought used.\nRecent unexpected car maintenance included the purchase of two new tires, for which her aunt\npaid.   She had applied for higher paying jobs but she was handicapped because of her financial\n17\nsituation.   Her expenditures are not indicative of an extravagant lifestyle.   On February 11, 2007,\n18\n19\nApplicant made the decision to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition.   The record was then closed.\n20\nPOLICIES\nThe President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national security\nand to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position that will give\nthat person access to such information.   Applicants are eligible for an ADP I/II/III position if there\n21\nis a finding that an applicant demonstrates sufficient trustworthiness to be eligible for a position of\ntrust.\u201d  \n22\nDoD Regulation 5200.2-R sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating\nthe trustworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process\nfactors: nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; frequency and recency\nof the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved;\nabsence or presence of rehabilitation; and probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue\nor recur in the future.  \n23\nDoD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in DoD Directive\n5220.6 before any final unfavorable determination may be made.   In trustworthiness determination\n24\ncases, the Government initially must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible to occupy an ADP position.25\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\n\nDirective, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n26\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)\n27\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n28\nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \n29\n7\nmitigate the facts.\nIn security clearance cases, an applicant has the ultimate burden of\n26  \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.   Any doubt about granting access will be resolved in favor of the national security.   The\n27\n28\nsame rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access to sensitive positions.\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  \n29\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe concern under Guideline F is that an individual who is financially overextended is at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked to\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nThe available information demonstrates Applicant has a history of not meeting her financial\nobligations.  She has been delinquent in payments on 23 accounts.  She had a previous bankruptcy\nin 2000.  Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 1 (A history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations) and FC DC 3 (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) are both applicable.\nVarious conditions can mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from financial\ndifficulties.  Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 3 (The conditions that resulted\nin the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) is applicable in this\ncase.  Applicant\u2019s problems commenced during her 1998 pregnancy when she developed severe\nhypertension.  After her child was born in 1999, she suffered a stroke which left her mildly disabled\non her left side, causing difficulty in moving from a sitting to a standing position.  She has had\nnumerous hospitalizations for short periods of time (as much as two weeks) in efforts to find\nappropriate medications that will control her blood pressure.  She had considered working a second\njob to meet her expenses but her doctors cautioned her to remain with one employer because they\nfelt the additional stress caused by a second job would be detrimental to her health.  Her physicians,\nhowever, believe that her disability is of insufficient severity to qualify her for Social Security\ndisability benefits.\nAnother mitigating condition is FC MC 4 (The person has received or is receiving counseling\nfor the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol.)  Applicant worked with a credit counseling service and attempted to prepare a budget that\nwould allow her to initiate debt retirement.  However, she was unable to meet these payments\n\nId.\n30\n8\nbecause of a lack of income.  While she met the first part of the mitigating condition, she has not\nshown that her problem is being resolved or is under control.  Therefore, this mitigating condition\nis inapplicable.\nFinally, FC MC 6 (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve bad debts.) is not applicable.  While Applicant may have initiated an effort to\nrepay creditors by filing a Chapter 13 Wage Earner bankruptcy petition, there is insufficient evidence\nbecause Applicant only expressed her intent to file in a statement submitted at the time the record\nclosed.\n \nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\na determination whether or not a person is eligible for an ADP I/II/III position.  All of the\ninformation contained in the case file about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable,\nmust be considered in making a determination.  In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, in addition to the\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, I also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating\nApplicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.   I considered her age (33),\n30\nher education, her employment, her medical condition, and what might be the cause of her financial\nproblems.  I concluded that her financial condition is as a result of her continuing health problems.\nI also find she is capable of maintaining, over a long period of time, a stable, conscientious\nrelationship with the U.S. government, as she has in the past.  I observed Applicant during the\nhearing, and especially during her testimony.  I find her testimony to be believable and find her to\nbe a sincere and credible witness, because she answered questions directly, completely, and honestly.\nHer financial history does not indicate an extravagant lifestyle.  She is not a spendthrift.  Given time\nI believe she will pay her debts.  This record raises no reasonable and persistent doubts about\nApplicant's ability to protect sensitive information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and\ndiscretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests.  I conclude Guideline F\nfor Applicant.  Applicant is qualified for a favorable eligibility determination.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

As required by Department of Defense (DoD)\nRegulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended,\nand DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) on July 31, 2006, detailing the basis for its decision\u2013concerns raised under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Regulation. Applicant\nanswered the SOR in writing on August 14, 2006, and elected to have the case decided on the written\nrecord in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on March\n29, 2007. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who\nwas afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate\nthe disqualifying conditions. Applicant received the FORM on April 10, 2007, and responded with\nadditional material on May 29, 2007. The case was assigned to me on June 25, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a federal government contractor. She has been\nemployed by the same company since 1990. Applicant holds a bachelor\u2019s degree. She is married, and\nhas two children.1\nApplicant developed financial problems some time in 2002, or before. In August 2002,\nApplicant enrolled in a debt management plan (DMP) from a credit counseling service to address\nher debts.

A letter from\n4\nthe credit counseling service states that \u201c[o]nce a creditor accepts a proposal, late payments stop,\ninterest rates reduce; accounts are re-aged.\u201d  Under these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s interpretation\n5\nof the question was reasonable. I find Applicant did not intentionally falsify her SF-85P.\nApplicant provided a statement for her background investigation in May 2005. She\nacknowledged owing several debts and stated:\nMy husband and I were working with a credit counseling agency and we were paying\n$542 per month to catch up the delinquencies. My husband was laid off about 2 \u00bd\nyears ago and we had to lower the payment to the credit counselor. We are paying\n$225 per month and they are being applied to [creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.f] and [creditor\nin SOR \u00b6 1.b]. We are trying to pay 2 accounts at a time until all are paid.6\nApplicant\u2019s documents show $225 payments to the DMP in March, July, and August 2005.\nThe estimated total balance of the listed debts in the DMP in October 2005, was $12,133. The credit\ncounseling service reported in a May 2007 letter that the last disbursement to Applicant\u2019s creditors\noccurred in December 2005. Applicant made additional payments directly to the creditors.  \n7\nApplicant denied owing the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. She stated she never had an account with this\ncompany. The debt is listed as a medical debt in the amount of $222, to a dentist. Applicant admitted\nshe had medical debts. She stated she paid some of her medical debts, and disputed others. This debt\nappears on credit bureau reports (CBR) of October 7, 2004, and May 19, 2006. The date of last\nactivity is listed as February 2000.  The debt does not appear on the two most recent credit reports,\n8\npossibly because the debt is now more than seven years old.  I find Applicant is responsible for this\n9\ndebt.\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, in the amount of approximately $1,562, is for a computer Applicant\npurchased. This debt was included in Applicant\u2019s DMP. The DMP documents show an estimated\nbalance of $510, as of October 2005. Applicant settled this account for $730 on April 11, 2007.  \n10\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c is a collection account in the amount of approximately $9,841.\nApplicant stated this is a collection agency collecting for a credit card company. The debt to the\noriginal creditor was included in Applicant\u2019s DMP. The DMP documents show an estimated balance\nof $6,464, as of October 2005. Additional payments were made directly to the creditor, or a\n\nItems 2, 8; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM.\n11\nItem 2; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM.\n12\nItem 5 at 1.\n13\nItem 2.

A collection agency letter of August 2005, shows a\npayment of $150, and a balance of $7,368. The CBR of May 19, 2006, shows a balance of $9,841.\nThe balance is listed as $11,347 on the CBR dated March 29, 2007. Applicant submitted a CBR\ndated May 29, 2007, with her response to the SOR. This CBR shows the last payment in April 2007,\nand a balance of $11,556.11\nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, are debts to the same bank, but with different account\nnumbers, in the amounts of approximately $3,209 and $2,614, respectively. In her response to the\nSOR, Applicant admitted to a debt to this bank, but stated the two debts were duplicates and that she\nonly had one account with this bank. A debt to this bank was included in Applicant\u2019s DMP. The\nDMP documents show an estimated balance of $1,576, as of October 2005. Additional payments\nwere made directly to the creditor. The CBR of May 29, 2007, only shows a balance due on the\naccount in SOR \u00b6 1.d, as $3,773.  I find that Applicant does not currently owe the debt alleged in\n12\nSOR \u00b6 1.e.\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f is to a financial institution in the amount of $3,456. In her May 2005\nstatement, Applicant admitted she had a credit card with this company, and listed an account number.\nShe stated she used the card to pay for car repairs.  The debt to this financial institution with this\n13\naccount number was included in Applicant\u2019s DMP. A debt to a financial institution which has a\nsimilar name, with a different account number, was also included in Applicant\u2019s DMP.  The DMP\n14\ndocuments show an estimated balance of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f, of $1,089, as of October 2005. In\nher response to the FORM, Applicant submitted evidence that she paid the debt to the financial\ninstitution with the similar name through a collection agency on April 11, 2007, in the amount of\n$1,165. Applicant submitted a CBR with her response to the SOR. This CBR lists the balance of the\ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.f, as $4,557.  I find Applicant paid a debt to an institution with a similar name to\n15\nthat alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f.  I find she still owes the debt as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f.\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g is to a credit card company in the amount of approximately $2,187.\nApplicant admitted to this debt in her response to the SOR, and stated she was making payments of\n$10 per month on this debt. The debt was included in Applicant\u2019s DMP. The DMP documents show\nan estimated balance of $518, as of October 2005. In her response to the FORM, Applicant wrote\nof this debt, \u201cinaccurate information, account has been updated to show a 0 balance.\u201d The CBR\nApplicant submitted with her response to the SOR tells a different story. It lists the balance of this\ndebt as $2,177.16\n\nItem 2; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM.\n17\nApplicant\u2019s response to FORM.\n18\nRegulation \u00b6 C2.1.2.\n19\nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.\n20\nRegulation \u00b6 C3.1.2.2.\n21\nRegulation \u00b6C6.1.1.1.\n22\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n24\n5\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h, in the amount of approximately $1,457, appears to be to a collection\nagency collecting on behalf of a financial institution. The CBR of March 29, 2007, lists this debt and\nin the same entry, identifies the financial institution that has the similar name to the debt in SOR \u00b6\n1.f, as addressed above. In her response to the SOR, Applicant stated this debt was addressed in the\nDMP under the institution with the similar name to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f. The CBR of May 29,\n2007, shows a zero balance on this account. While it is not totally clear, I believe Applicant paid this\ndebt with the check to the collection agency on April 11, 2007, in the amount of $1,165, as discussed\nabove in the paragraph discussing SOR \u00b6 1.f.  \n17\nThe total amount currently owed by Applicant on the above accounts is approximately\n$22,285. Applicant\u2019s financial issues have not impacted her job performance. Her performance\nevaluations have been excellent, and she recently received a promotion.   \n18\nPOLICIES\nAn individual may not be assigned to perform sensitive duties unless a competent security\nauthority determines it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to do so.  Positions\n19\ndesignated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions.  ADP III positions are\n20\n\u201cnonsensitive positions.\u201d  However, DOHA has been directed by a memorandum from the Deputy\n21\nUndersecretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) dated November 19, 2004, to apply\nthe due process provisions of the Directive for all trustworthiness determinations under ADP I, II,\nand including ADP III positions. Thus, even though ADP III positions are nonsensitive, they are\ntreated in the same way and adjudicated under the same guidelines and procedures as ADP I and II\ncases.\n\u201cThe standard that must be met for \u2026 assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that \u2026assigning\nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  The\n22\ngovernment has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less\n23\nthan a preponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to\n24\nan applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case\n\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\n25\nfavorable clearance decision.  The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance\n26\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether\n27\nan applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of\nprotecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\n28\nnecessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant. It is merely an indication that the\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for\n29\naccess to sensitive positions.\nDepartment of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the adjudicative procedures\ncontained in the Directive.  Additionally, each decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense\n30\ndecision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along\nwith the adjudicative process factors listed in the Directive and the Regulation. \nConditions that could raise a concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would\nmitigate concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or\nunethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations.\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1 (A\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations) and FC DC 3 (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts) apply in this case. Applicant has extensive delinquent debts that remain unpaid.\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 1 (The behavior was not recent), FC MC 2 (It was an isolated\nincident), FC MC 3 (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s\n\n7\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation)), FC MC 4 (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control), and\nFC MC 6 (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts). \nApplicant has a number of debts that remain unpaid. FC MC 1 and FC MC 2 do not apply.\nIn her statement in May 2005, applicant wrote that her husband was laid off from work\napproximately two and a half years earlier, causing them to lower their payments to the DMP. This\nis the only evidence submitted of a condition that was largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control. There\nwere no details about how long her husband was out of work, or the status of his current\nemployment. Applicant\u2019s husband was laid off after Applicant contracted with the credit counseling\nservice, so it was not the cause of her initial financial problems. I find FC MC 3 applicable, but\nbecause of the lack of further details, I give it only limited weight.\nApplicant received some counseling from the credit counseling service. The nature and extent\nof the counseling is unclear. Applicant still owes more than $22,000. She did not provide sufficient\ninformation for a finding that there are clear indications that her financial problems are being\nresolved or are under control. Applicant has not established FC MC 4.\nApplicant made payments on her debts for some time through the DMP. She also made\npayments on some of her debts directly to the creditors. She has recently paid or settled two debts.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s still owes more than $22,000, which is about $3,000 more than she listed as\nthe balance of her debts when she initiated the DMP in 2002. Based upon the limited evidence\npresented, I find FC MC 6 partially applicable.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations  could indicate that the person may\nnot properly safeguard classified information. \nBased on all the evidence, I have considered Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC\nDC) 2 (The deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant and material facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities).\nIn order to support a falsification allegation under Guideline E, there must first be a finding\nthat the answer on the questionnaire was incorrect or factually false. There was no finding in this\ncase that Applicant provided an incorrect or factually false answer to the question alleged in the\nSOR. Even if the answer was incorrect, that alone is not dispositive of the issue of Applicant\u2019s\nfalsification. The mere proof of an omission or an incorrect answer, standing alone, does not\nestablish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission or incorrect response\n\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03472 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 11, 2007). \n31\n8\noccurred.  Applicant answered the question correctly, at least within her interpretation of the\n31\nquestion. No Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition is applicable. I conclude Guideline E in her\nfavor.  \nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and the Regulation. I have also considered all the evidence, and every\nfinding of fact and conclusion discussed above. \nApplicant has an excellent record for the company which has employed her since 1990. The\nfacts and circumstances surrounding how Applicant fell into financial difficulties were never\nrevealed. Her financial situation caused her to enroll in a debt management plan through a credit\ncounseling service in 2002. She did not provide the complete history of her payments through the\nDMP. Her husband was laid off from work at some point in about 2002 or 2003, causing them to\nlower their payments to the DMP, but no evidence was submitted about how long her husband was\nunemployed, or the status of his current employment. Applicant stopped utilizing the DMP in\nDecember 2005. No information was submitted as to why Applicant stopped paying her debts\nthrough the DMP. Applicant paid or settled several of the debts. Two of the checks were issued on\nApril 11, 2007, the day after Applicant received the FORM. Even considering the recent payments,\nApplicant owes approximately $22,285, which is about $3,000 more than she owed when she\ninitiated the DMP in 2002. Applicant did not submit sufficient information for a determination that\nher financial problems are behind her.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the concerns based on her\nfinancial issues.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

He also has two state tax liens totaling approximately $3,000. He has failed to mitigate\nthe security concerns raised under financial considerations guideline. Applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance is denied.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nThe government submitted six items in support of its contentions.\n2\nI ordered department counsel to provide affirmative evidence that Applicant received the revised guidelines.\n3\nApplicant did receive the revised guidelines and submitted an additional response to the FORM on April 2, 2007.\nDepartment Counsel did not object.\nItem 3 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated November 28, 2006) at 1-2.\n4\nItem 4 (Application for Security Clearance (SF 86), dated May 5, 2005) at 1-8.\n5\n Id.\n6\nItem 3, supra note 3, at 1-2.\n7\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 26, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating that it was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence the\n1\nadministrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to\nApplicant when the SOR was issued.\nOn November 28, 2006, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR, and elected\nto have his case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the\ngovernment\u2019s written case on January 24, 2007. Applicant received a complete file of relevant\nmaterial (FORM) on January 31, 2007, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and\nsubmit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  The case was assigned to\n2\nme on March 22, 2007. Applicant submitted additional information on April 2, 2007.  \n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all allegations in his SOR response under Guideline F.  The admissions\n4\nare incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon\ndue consideration, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

Several\nof the debts have been in collection since 1998.  \n8\nApplicant has not made any payments on the delinquent accounts.  However, he is paying\non a $2,000 federal tax debt on a monthly basis.  This does not appear on the SOR. Applicant\n9\nprovided no evidence of any mitigating conditions involving medical problems or other extenuating\ncircumstances.  \n10\nApplicant\u2019s monthly net income is $3,421.83. He has monthly expenses of $3,052. He\ncurrently pays $100 a month to the IRS for his debt. Applicant listed a monthly payment to a\nfurniture company of $254. His monthly net remainder is $15.83. He lists no assets.11\nApplicant provided no information concerning his work record. However, he received\nvarious awards while in the military. He affirms his sense of duty for work and his country. He is\nsincere in his belief that he should be financially responsible.12\n.\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n13\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n14\n Id.\n15\n Id.\n16\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n17\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n18\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n15\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n16\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.17\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n18\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n19\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access to\n20\nsensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case.\n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.21\n\n6\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant accrued seven\ndelinquent debts with an approximate total balance of $14,850, and has 2 tax liens amounting to\n$3,000. He admits they are still outstanding debts. His 2007 credit report confirms the debt.\nConsequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) AG \u00b619(a), (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC \u00b619 (c), (a history of not meeting financial obligations)\napply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. I considered the Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b620 (a), (the behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). It does not apply because\nhe still carries a significant amount of delinquent debt. One collection account is from 2001. Despite\nsteady employment, he has not made any payments on these debts. \nApplicant  provides no evidence or explanation concerning any mitigating conditions to support\nthe FC MC AG \u00b620 (b), (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce, or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstance).\nFC MC AG \u00b620 (c) (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/\nor there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control) does not apply. This\nrecent endeavor in 2007 to contact two creditors does not mitigate years of ignoring the debt. Also, he\nindicated he will pay $50 a month to one credit company. A promise to take action in the future is not\nsufficient to mitigate the financial considerations concern. All of the debts remain outstanding. He has\nno structured plan to resolve these debts. Applicant's financial problems remain.  It is unlikely they will\nbe resolved in the near future.\nFC MC \u00b620(d) (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) is not applicable. Applicant has not shown that he established a record of\nsteady payments or financial stability. He made no attempts to resolve the majority of the delinquent\naccounts. His recent $50 payment to one creditor after receiving the SOR is not sufficient to conclude.\nthat he made a good-faith effort to resolve his debts despite his intentions to do so in the future. \nThe issue before me is not whether Applicant is still legally liable for any or all of his\noutstanding debts, but whether he has presented sufficient evidence of extenuation, mitigating or\nchanged circumstances to warrant a favorable security determination. His remaining unpaid debt\nconstitutes a security concern.  He has been employed with his current employer since June 2004. He\nlists other income on his personal financial statement which is presumably his retirement income. His\nvery low net monthly remainder does raise a doubt about his ability to resolve his outstanding debt.\nApplicant has not mitigated the government\u2019s concerns under Guideline F.\nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\n\n7\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination. He has an Honorable Discharge from the USMC and has various awards.\nEven an applicant with a good or even exemplary work history may engage in conduct that has\nnegative implications or presents doubt about his judgment. Despite steady employment, Applicant\nhas accrued multiple delinquent accounts. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied.\n.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

HENRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRichard Stevens, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; and  Memorandum\n1\nfrom the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Counterintelligence and Security, titled \u201cAdjudication of Trustworthiness\nCases,\u201d dated November 19, 2004.\nOn December 14, 2006, DOHA terminated the adjudication of Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness\n2\ndetermination because he failed to submit answers to the interrogatories propounded to him on October 24, 2006.\nApplicant responded on December 28, 2006, indicating that he submitted his answers, but not by certified mail, and\nprovided documentation in support of his assertion. On January 8, 2007, DOHA reinstated the processing of his\neligibility determination. I note that Applicant answered interrogatories in August 2006. See GE 3.\nTr. at 8.\n3\n2\nApplicant incurred delinquent debt during both of his marriages. He believed his two oldest\ndebts belonged to his first wife because she created the debts. His largest unpaid debt occurred\nbecause he could not pay the car payment and the extensive car repair bills on the same car. He lives\nwithin his financial means and voluntarily pays child support for his daughter and stepson. His\noverall work record in the military and with his employer reflects that he is reliable and trustworthy.\nHe has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns about his trustworthiness. Eligibility is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn August 23, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an\nADP I/II/III position. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the\napplication under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \u201cDirective\u201d).  On October 24, 2006,\n1\nDOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR,\nwhich is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29,\n2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006. DOHA\nrecommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether eligibility for a\nposition of trust should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. On December 28, 2006, Applicant\nsubmitted a notarized response to the allegations. He requested a hearing.2\nDOHA assigned this case to me on March 7, 2007, and issued a notice of hearing on March\n16, 2007. At the hearing on April 11, 2007, Applicant indicated that he received the notice of the\nhearing 15 days prior to the hearing.  I conducted the hearing as scheduled. The government\n3\nsubmitted seven exhibits (GE), which were marked and admitted into the record as GE 1-7 without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. I held the record open for Applicant to submit\ndocuments in support of mitigation, which he did. Applicant submitted four exhibits (App Ex), which\nwere marked and admitted into the record as App Ex A-D without objection. DOHA received the\nhearing transcript (Tr.) on April 24, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR, dated December 28, 2006.\n4\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s Application for a Position of Public Trust, dated August 23, 2004) at 1, 7; GE 2 (Certificate\n5\nof Release or Discharge from Active Duty, undated); Tr. at 14-15, 24-25.\nGE 1, supra note 5, at 7; GE 2, supra note 5; Tr. at 15, 18, 26-30.\n6\nGE 4 (Applicant\u2019s signed and sworn statement, dated March 8, 2005) at 2; GE 5 (Credit report, dated\n7\nSeptember 29, 2004) at 2, 6; Tr. at 15, 30-31.\nGE 4, supra note 7, at 2-3; GE 5, supra note 7, at 5; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR, supra note 4; Tr. at 19-20,\n8\n32-33.\n3\nIn his SOR response, Applicant admits to the allegations in subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c, and\n1.f under Guideline F of the SOR, but denies the remaining allegations.  Applicant\u2019s admissions are\n4\nincorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant, a 33-year-old man employed as a desktop support analyst with a Department of\nDefense contractor, seeks a position of public trust. He joined in the United States Army in 1992. The\nArmy stationed him in Germany for two years, which included six months in Bosnia. He also served\nin Kuwait for six months. He received the Army Achievement Medal, two Good Conduct Medals and\nseveral other ribbons and medals.5\nIn 1997, he married his first wife, who had a son from a prior relationship. Shortly after their\nmarriage, he opened a line of credit at the base credit union where he was stationed. His wife used\nthe credit line, although he has no idea what purchases his wife made. Problems developed in their\nrelationship because his wife did not like living where he had been stationed and wanted to return\nhome. He received an honorable discharge from the Army in early 1999 and they returned home. His\nwife gave birth to a daughter in April 1999, who died three weeks later. He separated from his wife\naround the same time and has not had any further contact with her. He divorced her in 2000.6\nIn 2001, Applicant married his second wife. She had a son, now age 9, when they married.\nTheir daughter is now 6 years old. In the summer of 2003 or 2004, an investigator met with him to\ndiscuss his ex-wife\u2019s criminal conduct. The investigator informed Applicant that his ex-wife had been\nwriting bad checks under several different names, including his last name. In July 2004, he notified\nthe credit reporting agencies about the possibility of a theft of his identify. The credit reports do not\nreflect any unusual entries subsequent to this notification.7\nApplicant met with a security clearance investigator in March 2005 and reviewed his credit\nissues as indicated in the September 29, 2004 credit report. At this time, he denied the two oldest\ndebts (1999) set forth in allegations 1.d and 1.e on the grounds the debts became his first wife\u2019s\nresponsibility upon their divorce. He does not have a separation agreement, which allocates these\ndebts to his first wife. This credit report reflects that he disputed the debt set forth in allegation 1.e,\nwhich does not appear on his 2006 credit report.8\nApplicant acknowledged the car repossession debt, explaining that after he purchased a two-\nyear-old car, he began to experience mechanical problems. He spent $4,000 on repairs, but the car\n\n Applicant\u2019s response to SOR, supra note 4; GE 4, supra note 7, at 3-4; Tr. at 20-23, 35-37. \n9\nTr. at 18-19, 32.\n10\nApp Ex B (Verification of loan approval); App Ex D (Earnings statements, dated April 13, 2007 and April\n11\n27, 2007); Tr. at 15-18, 31.\nApp Ex C (Performance evaluations for 2003 and 2004, plus an undated performance evaluation); Tr. at 39-40.\n12\n4\nrequired more repairs. Based on his mechanic\u2019s opinion that the car had been involved in an accident,\nhe requested the car dealership\u2019s help. When it refused to work with him on the problem, he told the\ncar note holder to take the car, which it did. He had paid more than two years on the loan. He does\nnot know if the car was sold after it was repossessed. The note holder requested him to pay this more\nthan $14,000 debt in a few large installments. He lacked the funds to do so. He has not contacted the\nnote holder to work out a monthly payment plan.9\nApplicant incurred the remaining debts alleged during his second marriage. Although he\ntestified that he gave his wife the money to pay the cell phone bill of $133 and the telephone bill of\n$448, she did not pay the bill. He also testified that he paid the credit card debt in full on several\noccasions, but his wife continued to \u201crun up the bill\u201d. These bills are not paid.10\nApplicant and his second wife separated in 2006. His gross monthly income totals $3,869 plus\novertime, and his net monthly pay totals $2,975 plus overtime. He voluntarily pays $700 a month in\nchild support for his daughter and stepson because, in his words, he has a moral responsibility. His\nother monthly expenses total approximately $1,875. His net remainder to pay debt totals\napproximately $400. Since the hearing, he obtained a loan against his 401k account to repay the debts\nlisted in allegations 1.b. 1.c. and 1.e. Outside of the debts listed in the SOR, his most recent credit\nreport reflects that he does not live beyond his financial means and that he does not use credit in\nexcess.11\nApplicant\u2019s employer rates his work performance as \u201cfully meets expectations\u201d. His work\nduties in desktop support involve loading software programs on computer systems and personal\ncomputer repair. He does not have access to sensitive information or information protected under the\nPrivacy Act.12\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. An administrative judge need not view the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines, are intended to assist the administrative judge in\nreaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. Although the presence or absence of a particular\ncondition or factor for or against a trustworthiness determination is not outcome determinative, the\nrevised AG should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. In\naddition, each security clearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these\nare: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\n\nDirective, revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b62(a)(1)-(9).\n13\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd., July 11, 1997).\n14\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd., December 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n15\nDepartment of the Navy v.

The\n14\ngovernment has the burden of proving controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify\nthe applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  The burden of proof is\n15\nsomething less than a preponderance of the evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the\n16\nburden shifts to the applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome\nthe case against him.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\n17\nfavorable clearance decision.  Conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be\n18\ndisqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative\nguidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.\nNo one has a right to a security clearance,  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n19\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n20\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\n21\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an\nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and\npatriotism of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\n22\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. Any\ndoubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\n\n Directive, revised AG \u00b6 2(b).\n23\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd.

The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations\n23\nfor access to sensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations.\nFinancial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, the \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18) The credit reports reflect old,\ndelinquent debts, one of which Applicant acknowledged. He incurred his two oldest debts during his\nfirst marriage, and the remaining debts during his second marriage. Because of the age of these debts\nand their delinquent status, Applicant showed an inability or unwillingness to pay his debts. Based on\nthe evidence of record, the government established the applicability of DC \u00b6 19(a) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts and DC \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nApplicant\u2019s largest debt relates to the repossession of a car he purchased in 2001. Although he\nmade monthly payments for over two years, he decided to return the car subsequent to spending $4,000\nin repairs, and after learning that the car had been involved in a wreck and would most likely continue\nto require costly repairs. He could not obtain any relief from the seller of the car and could not afford\nto continue paying for extensive repairs and make the monthly car payment. Thus, MC \u00b6 26(b) the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances has some application\nbecause he saw his decision to return the car as the way to resolve his mounting expenses.  \n24\nApplicant has not met with a financial counselor; however, subsequent to the hearing, he\napplied for a loan against his 401k account, which has been approved. He stated he intended to use this\nmoney to pay the three small debts of $133, $122 and $1,052. He also indicates that he contacted two\nother creditors, but has not made any arrangements to pay these debts. MC \u00b6 20(d) the individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts has some\napplication. While he is not required to be debt free, he must manage his income and expenditures in\na reasonable and prudent manner. At this time, he pays his monthly expenses and has some residual\nincome each month to meet unexpected expenses. He obtained a loan to pay some of his debt, but has\n\nThe remaining financial considerations mitigating condition set forth in AG 20(f) does not apply in this case.\n25\np.7, n. 21.\n26\n7\nnot provided proof that the payments have been made. A promise to pay in the future is not sufficient\nto mitigate the financial considerations concern or evidence of a good faith effort to repay debt.\nHowever, the fact that he obtained a loan against his 401K account to pay three small debts is some\nevidence of his intent.\nApplicant denied owing the debts alleged in paragraphs 1.d through 1.e of the SOR. His 2004\ncredit report reflects that he challenged the validity of the $122 debt in allegation 1.e, which does not\nappear on his more recent credit report. MC \u00b6 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute\nthe legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof\nto substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue has some\napplicability.25\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of his acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nThe creditors for the unpaid bills, including a credit card, two cell phone bills and a personal\nloan, in allegations 1.b through 1.e of the SOR, are barred from collecting these debts under his state\u2019s\n3-year statute of limitations. See State Code. Ann. \u00a7 15-3-530.  Thus, he receives partial credit for\n26\nresolution of his debt. The state Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value\nof application of the statute of limitations:\nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they\nstimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and\nstability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of\nlimitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation.\nSignificantly, statutes of limitations provide potential defendants with certainty that\nafter a set period of time, they will not be ha[led] into court to defend time-barred\nclaims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights.\nStatutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system.\nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (Ct. App. 2005) (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted).\nElimination of these delinquent debts through the statute of limitations has partially ended his\npotential vulnerability to improper financial inducements because he is no longer \u201cfinancially\n\n8\noverextended\u201d. Applicant did not know about the unpaid bills from his first marriage because he\nmistakenly believed that the debt transferred to his first wife when they divorced. He has always\nacknowledged that he owes the debt from when his car was repossessed. The car note holder has not\nindicated a willingness to work with Applicant towards the resolution of his debt; rather it requested\na few large payments from him, which he cannot make. His failure to resolve this debt in the manner\nrequested by the note holder does not reflect irresponsibility. He lives within his monthly income and\nhas not incurred excessive unpaid debt outside of the car loan in the last three or four years. \nApplicant timely pays his rent and utilities. He voluntarily assumed responsibility for paying\nchild support not only for his daughter, but also for a stepson because he recognizes his obligation to\ntake care of these children. Even though several of his debts are barred by the statute of limitations,\nby obtaining a loan to pay these debts, he has indicated his willingness to assume responsibility for\nthese debts, although he has not actually paid the debts.\nApplicant performs his duties well and is a reliable employee. I have weighed the mitigating\nfactors, the reasons for his debts and his failure to pay them, his recent efforts to assume responsibility\nfor some of the old debts, his attitude towards his child support responsibilities, his military record,\nand his work ethic against his failure to resolve his old debts earlier and his reluctance to initiate a\npayment plan with the car note holder. I find that the overwhelming weight of the evidence indicates\nthat he is a person of integrity, who is trustworthy. He would not act in a manner which would harm\nhis employer or the government. There is little likelihood he can or would violate the privacy rights\nof his employer\u2019s clientele. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-f:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the evidence presented in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness determination.  On August 17, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline\nG (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline H (Drug Involvement)\n\n2\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On December 29, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Shari Dam\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness determination.  Department Counsel filed a timely\nappeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30\nDepartment Counsel asserted the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s conclusion\nthat Applicant had mitigated the Guidelines G, J, and H trustworthiness concerns is arbitrary,\ncapricious, and contrary to law; and whether the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is erroneous in that she\nfailed to analyze the case in light of the evidence viewed as a whole.  Finding error, we reverse the\ndecision of the Judge.    \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings:\nApplicant is 22 years old with two years of college.  He and his girlfriend have a five-month-\nold daughter.   He and his younger brother live with their parents.  \n             Applicant\u2019s criminal history began in 1998, when he was 14 years old and was charged with\nmaking Annoying Phone Calls to a classmate. He subsequently began consuming alcohol and\nmarijuana, which lead to ten separate arrests for related criminal conduct. \nIn July 2000, he was arrested and charged with having consumed alcohol after having been\nstopped for speeding. He pled No Contest to the misdemeanor, was fined $113, and ordered to\nundergo an alcohol assessment.  His driver's license was suspended for three months.  He was 16\nyears old. \nIn May 2002, he was arrested and charged with Underage Drinking and Possession of\nMarijuana after being stopped by the police who found liquor in the car.  He was found guilty and\nfined. \nIn July 2002, he was arrested and charged with Underage Drinking and Possession of\nAlcohol.  He was found guilty and fined $286. \nIn August 2002, he and some friends were arrested and charged with Underage Drinking at\na campground. He pled No Contest and was fined $349. A month later he was charged with\nDisorderly Conduct and Underage Drinking,  after being involved in a physical altercation.  He was\nfined a total of $324 on both charges.  He was 18 years old at the time of those arrests in 2002. \nIn July 2003, he and his friends were arrested for Underage Drinking at a birthday party.  He\nwas found guilty and paid a $102 fine.\nPursuant to a court order, Applicant entered an outpatient substance abuse program in\nOctober 2003. While in treatment for two months, he participated in classes and individual therapy,\n\n3\nand was prohibited from consuming alcohol. He received a diagnosis of Alcohol Abuse and a\nrecommendation to abstain from alcohol consumption while in treatment. \nIn January 2004, one month after leaving treatment, he and his friends left a restaurant\nwithout paying their bill. The police were called and he was charged with Theft-Defraud Innkeeper\nand fined $305. He had been drinking before the incident.\n \nIn February 2004, he consumed alcohol and was involved in another fight.  He was arrested\nand charged with Underage Alcohol Possession and Disorderly Conduct. He paid a $452 fine. \nIn April 2004, he was fined $705 after he pled guilty to Operating Motor Vehicle While\nIntoxicated, Operating with a Prohibited Blood Alcohol Content (BAC), and Speeding. His BAC\nwas .19.  He had been drinking to celebrate his 20  birthday when the police stopped him in the early\nth\nmorning. His license was suspended for nine months.\nTwo months later, in August 2004, he consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication and\nbecame embroiled in a serious physical altercation. He was stabbed several times, resulting in a\nperiod of hospitalization.  He subsequently pled guilty to Disorderly Conduct and received a deferred\nprosecution sentence. He was ordered to perform 50 hours of community service and undergo\nanother alcohol and drug assessment.  He was 20 years old. Applicant believes that the incident\naltered his life and is the reason he no longer consumes alcohol. While recovering in the hospital,\nhe realized he needed to change his life or he would die.  \nIn accordance with his plea agreement, Applicant entered another substance abuse program\nin May 2005. While in treatment, he participated in eight individual psychotherapy sessions, attended\nclasses and had three consecutive negative urine drug screens.  In November 2005, he was\ndischarged with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence and cannabis abuse (both in early full remission).\nAccording to the Discharge Summary,  Applicant admitted that he used marijuana three times\nin the early months of treatment, but also \"reported two months of abstinence from marijuana at his\nlast individual session.\" The Summary noted that \"he appeared internally committed to long term\nabstinence from alcohol due to the problems alcohol has caused in his life in the past.\"  It indicated\nthe successful completion of the treatment plan goals and a good prognosis. The program counselor\nrecommended that he \"continue his abstinence from alcohol and to follow his harm reduction plan\nregarding marijuana . . . and continue to increase his sober support system.\" \nApplicant no longer  associates with his previous friends. Since leaving treatment, he has not\nparticipated in any form of a program supportive of sobriety, such as Alcoholics Anonymous.\nApplicant credits such events as the stabbing incident and the birth of his daughter with his change\n\n4\nof attitude in favor of sobriety.  Applicant has received good performance evaluations from his place\nof employment.\n  \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s findings\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \nDepartment Counsel does not challenge the Judge\u2019s findings.  Therefore, they are not at issue\nin this appeal. \n \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The\nAppeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a trustworthiness\ndetermination if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive  \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.32.3 and\nE3.1.33.3.  Once the government presents evidence raising trustworthiness concerns, the burden\nshifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.15.\n\u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn\nsimply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their\napplication requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See\nISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).  \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\n\nDirective \u00b6  E2.A7.1.3.2.\n1\nDirective \u00b6   E2.A7.1.3.3.\n2\nDirective \u00b6  E2.A10.1.3.6.\n3\nSee Tr. at 26.  \u201cI was 20 at the time.  This was again after use of alcohol.  Late at night we went to a...restaurant,\n4\nate our food and ditched, didn\u2019t pay.\u201d  \nSee, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 02-29373 at 4  (App. Bd. Mar. 2, 2005).   \n5\nTr. at 32. \n6\nTr. at 26.  \n7\nTr. at 33. \n8\n5\nIn resolving the case in Applicant\u2019s favor, the Judge found several conditions that she\nconcluded mitigated the trustworthiness concerns raised by the Government\u2019s evidence: that\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol troubles are not recent  and that Applicant has evidenced changes in behavior\n1\nthat are \u201csupportive of sobriety\u201d  (Guideline G); that Applicant has demonstrated an \u201cintent not to\n2\nabuse any drugs in the future\u201d (Guideline H); and \u201cclear evidence of successful rehabilitation\u201d3\n(Guideline J).  In her whole person analysis, the Judge noted Applicant\u2019s youth at the time of his\nmisconduct, the \u201clife altering\u201d quality of the stabbing incident and her evaluation of Applicant\u2019s\nmaturity.  Additionally, she considered \u201c[Applicant\u2019s] candid testimony about his irresponsible\nalcohol consumption and marijuana use for approximately five years, and his abstinence from\nmarijuana over the last year and alcohol consumption over the past two years.\u201d  Decision at 6.    \nOn the other hand, we note a substantial amount of record evidence which undermines the\nJudge\u2019s conclusions regarding mitigation.  For example, Applicant was convicted of defrauding an\ninnkeeper by failing to pay his bill, yet the Judge\u2019s analysis does not discuss this aspect of the case.4\nAlthough she is presumed to have considered all the evidence,   a theft conviction, which entails\n5\nmoral turpitude, is sufficiently relevant to Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness as to merit explicit\nexamination, and failure to do so impairs the reasonableness of the Judge\u2019s decision.  Likewise the\nextent of Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption is troublesome.  For example, on one incident of  alcohol-\ninduced fighting Applicant had consumed \u201csix to ten beers;\u201d  he had consumed alcohol on the\n6\noccasion when he failed to pay his restaurant bill;  and when he operated a vehicle while intoxicated\n7\nhe had drunk \u201cover ten . . . Jack and cokes.\u201d   That Applicant consumed alcohol in substantial\n8\namounts, that the latter two incidents mentioned above occurred after he had completed his first\nalcohol rehabilitation program, that alcohol resulted in ten arrests, and that Applicant has not\nfollowed up his second rehabilitation program through AA attendance weakens his case that his\ncommitment to sobriety is permanent.   \nThe Judge\u2019s conclusions regarding mitigation are also undermined by  the fact that Applicant\ncontinued to use marijuana even while undergoing his second rehabilitation program.  Applicant\nExhibit B, the discharge summary from this program, mentions three \u201crelapses\u201d into marijuana use\nduring the course of his treatment and observes that Applicant \u201cstill had a pro cannabis belief system\nwhich supported continued marijuana use after counseling.\u201d  AE B at 1.  \n\n6\nThe Board notes that the transcript contains following colloquy between Applicant and the\nJudge:\nQ: And your date of sobriety is what...?\nA: ...August 22  of \u201804.\nnd\nQ: How did I know you\u2019re not still drinking or using marijuana?\nA: I \u2013 I\u2019m\u2013I\u2019m not.  I don\u2019t know...I\u2019ve changed my life a lot since then.  Tr. at 27.  \nIn this testimony Applicant appears to assert that he has refrained from using alcohol or\nmarijuana since August 22, 2004, the date upon which he was stabbed in an alcohol fueled\naltercation.  However, this statement is contradicted by Applicant\u2019s own evidence that he used\nmarijuana during the rehabilitation program in 2005.  This apparent contradiction casts serious doubt\nas to whether Applicant was truthful during his testimony, which clearly goes to the essence of a\ntrustworthiness determination.  The Judge does not discuss it in her analysis of the case, although\nshe alludes to it when she cites his having abstained from marijuana only \u201cduring his later phase of\nhis outpatient program.\u201d  Decision at 6.  \nAfter considering the Judge\u2019s decision, the briefs of the parties, and the record as a whole we\nconclude that, as regards Guidelines H and J, the decision fails to consider relevant evidence in its\napplication of the mitigating conditions as well as in the whole person analysis.  See ISCR Case No.\n03-22861 at 2-3(App. Bd. June 2, 2006).  Therefore, as regards these guidelines, the decision is\narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.   Given the extent of Applicant\u2019s misconduct, the statement\nin AE B to the effect that Applicant was favorably disposed toward marijuana use (his \u201cpro cannabis\nbelief system\u201d) even after his second rehabilitation program, and the absence of record evidence\nexplaining the apparent contradiction between Applicant\u2019s testimony and AE B, the Judge\u2019s holding\nthat Applicant had met his burden of persuasion is not sustainable on this record.  Therefore, remand\nis not an appropriate remedy.           \nOrder\n\n7\nThe Judge\u2019s decision granting Applicant a trustworthiness determination is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Department Counsel filed a timely appeal\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in\nconcluding that the Government had failed to meet its burden of production regarding certain of\nApplicant\u2019s debts; whether the Judge\u2019s application of Financial Considerations Mitigating\nConditions was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person\nanalysis was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Finding no harmful error, we affirm the\nJudge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge found that Applicant, an employee of a defense contractor, has numerous\nunsatisfied debts.  Much of this debt originated during periods of unemployment in the 1990s.\nApplicant has not incurred substantial debt or unpaid loans in the past seven years.  In addition, she\nno longer uses credit cards, paying cash instead.  She has retained the services of a financial\ncounseling agency to assist her in resolving her debt problems.  \nThe Board has examined the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole.  Department\nCounsel argues that the Judge\u2019s application of Guideline F mitigating conditions was error, given\nthe ongoing nature of the debts and Department Counsel\u2019s view that Applicant has not approached\ndebt resolution in a reasonable manner.  The Board notes that an applicant is not required to show\nthat she has completely paid off her indebtedness, only that she has established a reasonable plan to\nresolve her debts and has \u201ctaken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-\n09684 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006).  In this case, the Judge gave Applicant partial credit under the\nmitigating conditions as to the evidence she provided.  It is the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis, which\nconcludes that Applicant is making reasonable efforts to pay her debts off and to live within her\nmeans, that constitutes \u201ca rational connection between the facts found\u201d and her favorable decision.\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983).  Therefore, even if individual mitigating conditions do not per se justify the grant of a\nsecurity clearance to Applicant, the Board concludes that, on the facts of this case, the Judge\u2019s\nfavorable security clearance decision is sustainable based on her whole-person analysis.  The Board\nneed not agree with a judge\u2019s decision in order to find it sustainable.  ISCR Case No. 06-23881 at\n2 (App. Bd. Nov. 2, 2007).  Any error in the Judge\u2019s conclusion regarding the Government\u2019s burden\nof production is harmless.   See ISCR Case No. 02-29143 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2005).\nAccordingly, the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is neither arbitrary, capricious, nor contrary to law.\n\n3\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.\n  \nSigned: Jean E.

When she stopped her payments, many of the\ncreditors obtained judgments. For the last two and one-half years, she has consistently and routinely\nmade payments on the judgments and one outstanding debt. While she has not resolved all her debts,\nshe has made a good faith effort to pay her debts. She has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns about\nher finances under Guideline F. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the\nSOR sets forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department\nof Defense, effective September 1, 2006. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked. On December 30, 2006, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations. She\nrequested a hearing.\nDOHA assigned this case to me on May 10, 2007. It included a Motion to Amend the SOR\nby the Government. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 25, 2007. I held a hearing on June 20,\n2007. At the hearing, the Government  presented arguments on its Motion to Amend the SOR.\nApplicant acknowledged receiving the motion and did not object to it. I granted the Government\u2019s\nmotion and amended the SOR to include allegations 1.c and 1.d. Six Government exhibits (GE), 1-6,\nwere marked and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant submitted 17 documents,\nwhich were marked and admitted into evidence as Applicant Exhibits (AE), A-Q, without objection.\nApplicant testified. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 3, 2007. I held the record\nopen until July 20, 2007 for the submission of more evidence by Applicant. On July 18, 2007, she\ntimely filed a request for one additional week to submit her evidence. The Government did not object\nto her request. By Order dated July 19, 2007, I granted Applicant\u2019s request and held the record open\nuntil July 27, 2007. Applicant timely submitted 12 additional documents, which were marked as AE\nR-CC and admitted into the record without objection.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations under Guideline F, subparagraphs 1.a-1.c, 1.e, and 1.h.\nof the SOR.  Those admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. She denied the remaining\n1\n\nId.\n2\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, dated May 13, 2005) at 1-2.\n3\nId. at 1-3; App Ex O (Applicant\u2019s resume); Tr. at 62-67.\n4\nGE 3 (Credit report, dated July 14, 2005); GE 4 (Credit report, dated August 9, 2006); GE 5 (Credit report,\n5\ndated November 9, 2006); GE 6 (Credit report, dated May 1, 2007).\n3\nallegations.  After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration, I\n2\nmake the following findings of fact.\nApplicant, who is 49-years-old, works for a contractor to the Department of Defense. She\ncompleted her security clearance application in May 2005.3\nApplicant graduated from college with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering\nin 1984. Until June 1994, she worked steadily and regularly. Over the next 10 years, her employment\nfluctuated. Her resume indicates that from 1994 until 1998, she worked two summers. In 1998, she\nstarted working full-time, which ended in June 1999. In September 1999, she entered graduate\nschool. She again worked from July 2000 until February 2001. She received a Master of Divinity\ndegree in 2002. She immediately began employment which ended 4 months later because her\nemployer was not paying her regularly. In May 2003, she began part-time employment at a\nbookstore, a job she continues to work one day a week. She began her current employment in\nJanuary 2004. During her periods of unemployment, she worked as a substitute teacher.4\nApplicant incurred significant credit debt in the 1990s. She failed to keep up with her\npayments when she was unemployed and eventually stopped making any payments. She destroyed\nmost of her credit cards in the 1990s, and has not acquired more credit card debt since then. A review\nof Appellant\u2019s credit reports dated July 14, 2005, August 9, 2006, November 9, 2006, May 1, 2007,\nand the SOR, shows the following outstanding, unpaid debts and judgments totaling $39,815, and\ntheir current status, as the reason for security concerns under the financial considerations guideline:5\nSOR \u00b6\nAccount Type & Amount,\nDate of Last Activity\nStatus\nEvidence\n1.a\nJudgment            $4,218\nNovember 2003\nUnpaid\nGE 4, GE 5, GE 6\n1.b\nJudgment            $4,268\nMarch 2003\nPaying $100 monthly\nApp Ex Y, App Ex Z\n1.c\nJudgment            $9,081\nFebruary 2004\nPaying $100 monthly\nApp Ex I, App Ex Z\n1.d \nCredit card          $   382\nJune 2001\nUnpaid; Barred Statute\nof Limitations\nGE 4, GE 5, GE 6,\nApp Ex U\n1.e\nCredit card          $3,118\nJuly 2007\nPaid in full\nApp Ex H; App Ex S\n\nApp Ex CC (Copy of court record).\n6\nThe government incorrectly asserts that this creditor filed for garnishment because it was not satisfied with\n7\nApplicant\u2019s $100 a month payments. Garnishment of wages is a mechanism to collect a judgment which is not being paid.\nAs long as a debtor makes monthly payments, a state court will not grant a request for garnishment.\nApp Ex I (Statements from creditor on payments), App Ex Z (Copy of money order receipts).\n8\nApplicant submitted copies of the court records for the two judgments she currently pays. See App Ex AA\n9\n(Court docket sheet for allegation 1.b in the SOR); App Ex BB (Court docket sheet for allegation 1.c in the SOR). App\nEx AA shows that the judgment in allegation 1.b had two court case numbers. The third judgment has a case number\nwhich is different from any of the court case numbers for the other judgments she pays or paid. See GE 6, supra note\n5, at 1; App Ex Y (Documents related to March 2003 judgment); App Ex Z, supra note 8.\n4\n1.f.\nCredit card          $7,522\nOctober 2001\nUnpaid, Barred Statute\nof Limitations \nGE 4, GE 5, GE 6\n1.g\nCredit card          $1,567\nOctober 2001\nUnpaid, Barred Statute\nof Limitations\nGE 4, GE 5, GE 6\n1.h\nCredit card          $8,333\nPaid $500\nApp Ex K; App Ex Z\n1.i\nCredit card          $1,326\nSame account number\nas 1.g\nGE 4, GE 5, GE 6\nApplicant submitted documentation, reflecting that she paid in full in December 2006 a\njudgment entered against her by a creditor not listed in the SOR . She also provided documentation\n6\nwhich shows that since November 2004, she has been regularly paying on the judgment entered\nagainst her in February 2004. The creditor\u2019s records reflect that it received two $20 garnishment\npayments in March and May 2004 from Applicant\u2019s part-time book store employment. The book\nstore then reduced her work hours and stopped further garnishment payments.  Although she has\n7\nbeen regularly paying this debt for two and one-half years, she still owes over $8,000 on the debt.8\nApplicant initiated payments, at least as early as February 2005, on the judgment entered\nagainst her in March 2003. Although the law firm collecting this debt stated that she had paid $950\non the judgment, her records reflect additional payments of $1,750 for total payments of $2,400,\nleaving a balance of $2,054. She has not started payments on the November 2003 judgment because\nshe was not aware of this judgment. At the hearing, she credibly stated that she believed she was\npaying on all the judgments against her. A careful review of the record evidence indicates that a third\njudgment exists and is unpaid.9\nApplicant made the final payment on one credit card debt on July 27, 2007. As to the large\nunpaid credit card debt listed in allegation 1.h, her evidence shows numerous contacts with the\ncreditor listed in the credit reports, at least $500 in payments which are not reflected by the creditor,\nand letters stating that she had the wrong account number. She believe she paid the debt listed in\nallegation 1.d, but cannot provide proof of payment. The record evidence indicates that this debt is\n\nGE 4-6, supra note 5; App Ex K (Letters, dated June 19, 2007, April 19, 2007, September 9, 2006, July 25,\n10\n2006, April 12, 2006, February 5, 2006, January 19, 2006, December 22, 2005, December 9, 2005); App Ex S (Creditor\nletter, dated July 27, 2007 and other payment letters); App Ex U (credit report, dated June 26, 2007).\nGE 2(Answers to Interrogatories and attachments); App Ex V (Earnings statements from May through July\n11\n2007); Tr. at 62, 121.\nApp Ex A (letter, dated June 13, 2007); App Ex B (Letter, dated June 12, 2007); App Ex C (Letter, dated June\n12\n19, 2007); App Ex D (Letter, dated June 12, 2007); App Ex E (Letter, dated June 18, 2007); App Ex F (Letter, dated\nJune 18, 2007); App Ex N (Debt reduction information); App Ex X (Signed application for financial counseling).\nDirective, revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\n13\n5\nunpaid and higher than the amount listed in the SOR. She denies owing the other three credit card\ndebts, which are with the same creditor that obtained two judgments against her in 2003.  \n10\nAppellant currently earns approximately $65,000 a year in gross salary from her two jobs.\nHer net monthly income totals about $3,415. Her monthly expenses, including debt repayments and\nstudent loan payments, total approximately $3,100 a month. She drives a 1993 car, which is debt\nfree. She lives with her sister and does not live extravagantly.11\nApplicant\u2019s management recommends her for a security clearance based on her work ethic\nand demonstrated ability to handle proprietary data properly. She has not violated security\nprocedures during her employment. She is a respected member of her work team. Her religious co-\nworkers attest to her character and commitment to her church. She contacted several financial\ncounseling agencies about assisting her with her debt payments. She recently retained the services\nof one of these agencies.12\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. An administrative judge need not view the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines, are intended to assist the administrative judge in\nreaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. Although the presence or absence of a particular\ncondition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the revised AG should be\nfollowed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. In addition, each security\nclearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-\nperson concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent,\nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral\nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.13\n\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd., July 11, 1997).\n14\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd., Dec. 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n15\nDepartment of the Navy v.

The government\n14\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n15\npreponderance of the evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the\n16\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nher.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n17\ndecision.18\nNo one has a right to a security clearance,  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n19\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n20\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\n21\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an\nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and\npatriotism of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\n22\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nFinancial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, the \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under FCMC\n23\n6 for debts being resolved through garnishment). \n7\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18.) The credit\nreports reflect several old, large, unpaid debts and judgments. Because of the age of these debts and\njudgments and their delinquent status, Applicant showed a long term inability or unwillingness to\npay her debts. Based on the evidence of record, the Government established the applicability of DC\n\u00b6 19 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and DC \u00b6 19 (c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligations to all admitted allegations and allegation 1.d.\nIn light of Applicant\u2019s denial of SOR allegations 1.f, 1.g and 1.i, the government has the\nburden of proving that these unpaid debts are Applicant\u2019s. Although these three controverted debts\nare listed on her credit reports, this fact alone is insufficient to demonstrate that these are her debts.\nA review of the credit reports reflects that the account numbers for the debts listed in allegation 1.g\nand 1.i are the same. In addition, the credit reports show that the date of last activity on these\ncontroverted debts is October 2001. In 2003, the named creditor for these debts obtained two\njudgments against Applicant. The record evidence does not indicate whether the controverted debts\nare in addition to the judgments obtained by the named creditor or the same. Thus, the government\nhas not met its burden of proving these allegations, which are found in favor of Applicant.\nMC \u00b6 26 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment has some applicability.  While several judgments\n23\nwere entered against her in 2003 and early 2004, these judgments were based on debts incurred in\nthe 1990s. Applicant has not incurred any substantial credit debt or unpaid loans in the last seven\nyears. She no longer uses credit cards; rather she chooses to pay her bills in cash. She has accepted\nresponsibility for her debt problem and her long ago debts do not cast doubt on her current reliability,\ntrustworthiness or good judgment.\nMC \u00b6 26 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances is\nraised. For a period of 10 years, Applicant worked sporadically. While her initial periods of\nunemployment are not explained, her later unemployment resulted from job termination and lack\nwage payment. During her periods of unemployment, she worked as a substitute teacher, a job which\ndid not provide sufficient income to pay all her debts. Given the high level of her debt, she managed\nher finances to the best of her ability.\nMC \u00b6 20 (c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control has some applicability.\nApplicant very recently retained a financial counseling agency to help resolve all issues related to\nany remaining unpaid debts. She has assume responsibility for her unpaid debts by paying several\ndebts and making monthly payments on other judgment debts.\nMC \u00b6 20 (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts applies. After securing full-time employment, Applicant began to repay her\ndebts. She routinely pays $100 a month to two judgment creditors. While the principal for the debt\n\nA State Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of application of the statute of\n24\nlimitations:\nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they stimulate activity,\npunish negligence and promote repose by giving security and stability to human affairs. The\ncornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of law to\npromote and achieve finality in litigation. Significantly, statutes of limitations provide potential\ndefendants with certainty that after a set period of time, they will not be ha[led] into court to defend\ntime-barred claims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights.\n8\nin the allegation 1.c has only been reduced about $1,000, she has consistently and regularly paid the\ncreditor for more than two years. Likewise, she made monthly payments over the same period of\ntime on another judgment and one old debt, which are now paid in full. She has made attempts to\nregularly pay on her one remaining large debt (allegation 1.h), but has documented the problems she\nhas encountered with the creditor regarding credit for her past payments and the existence of her\naccount. She retained the financial counseling service to help with this problem. She has made\nsignificant efforts to resolve her unpaid judgments.\nMC \u00b6 20 (e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due\ndebt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of\nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue, and MC \u00b6 20 (f) the affluence\nresulted from a legal source do not apply under the facts of this case.\nWhole Person Analysis\nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance decisions are\nnot intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past transgressions. Rather, the\nobjective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, common sense assessment of a person\u2019s\ntrustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Thus, in reaching this decision, I\nhave considered the whole person concept in evaluating Appellant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in\nprotecting our national interests.\nApplicant mismanaged her finances in the 1990s. She over used her credit cards, then\ndefaulted on her payments when she did not work full-time or at all. During her periods of\nunemployment, her family provided some financial support for her basic needs. Her financial\ncircumstances have improved significantly since she began working with her current employer. She\nis not required to be debt free to have a security clearance, but she is required to manage her income\nand expenses. She has demonstrated through her evidence that she is managing her income and\nexpenses, as she lives within her monthly income. Her expenses included repayment of her current\nand past debts, as shown by her consistent payments on her student loan and judgments. She has not\nincurred any additional unpaid debt in many years. She took control of her debt problems, which has\nresulted in a slow and steady resolution of her financial problems. She has not taken steps to resolve\nthe November 2003 judgment, as she did not know about it. Given her payment of her other\njudgments, it is highly likely she will act responsibly towards this debt.\nWhile I have held that the government has not established its case as to allegations 1.f, 1.g\nand 1.i, I also note that the creditor for these debts is time barred from collecting these debts under\nthe state statute of limitations.  However, in light of Applicant\u2019s recent payments on the debt in\n24\n\nStatutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system.\nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (Ct. App. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted).\n9\nallegations 1.h, the 3-year period from which a creditor can seek collection through legal process\nmay have begun again. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisors and management praise her work ethic and skills. She properly\nhandles her employer\u2019s propriety data. She has shown a consistent track record for payment of her\ndebt and has acted responsibly towards her debts. Given her consistent compliance with security\nrules, her work performance and assumption of responsibility for her debts, there is little likelihood\nof a recurrence of her conduct in the future, and the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or\nduress is nonexistent. I have weighed her work performance, compliance with rules, her acceptance\nof responsibility for her debts, and her actions taken to resolve her debts and conclude that she has\nmitigated the Government\u2019s concerns about her finances under Guideline F.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F :\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-i: \nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana on two occasions, once in 2001, and again in 2004, after having\ncompleted a security clearance application has been mitigated.  He has not used marijuana for the\n\n2\nlast three years and has demonstrated that he will not use it in the future.  Clearance is granted.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 25, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 19, 2006, and requested a hearing\nbefore a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the undersigned on November 30,\n2006.  A notice of hearing was issued on December 14, 2006, scheduling the hearing for January 18,\n2007.  At the hearing the Government presented three exhibits.  The Applicant presented four\nexhibits and called three witnesses.  He also testified on his own behalf.  He submitted one Post-\nHearing Exhibit consisting of five enclosures and nineteen pages.  The official transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on January 26, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 25 years old and has a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Electrical Engineering.  He is\ncurrently working on his Master\u2019s Degree.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Engineer\nand Member of the Technical Staff.  He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with\nhis employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of\nallegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are entered\nas to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement).  The Government alleges that the Applicant is\nineligible for clearance because he has abused illegal substances.\nThe Applicant admitted the allegation set forth in the SOR under this guideline.  He used\nmarijuana on two occasions, once in 2001, and again in 2004, after he had completed a security\nclearance application for the department of defense.  On both occasions he knew that he was wrong\nand that he should not have done it.  He realizes the seriousness of his poor choices and is truly\nremorseful.  He also understands the importance of his position with the defense contractor and the\nresponsibilities that come with it.\n  \nSince 2000, the Applicant has been working toward his degree in Engineering.  Since June\n2003, he has been an intern working for a defense contractor, as an intern, while still a college\nstudent, and was offered a full time job when he graduated.  In January 2004, he started working full\ntime for a defense contractor.  He applied for a fellowship position whereby he could earn his\nMasters Degree at USC, and his employer would place him on part-time work status and pay for his\nschooling.  In the fall of 2004, he was accepted into the program and he has been attending USC for\nthe last three semesters.  He is scheduled to graduate in December 2007        \n\n4\nHe contends that he has now matured and grown as an individual.  He no longer associates\nwith drug using individuals and never intends to use marijuana again.  He pays his student loans and\nis currently assisting his family in purchasing a house by making one-forth of the mortgage and\nescrow payment each month.  He is very involved in his church and serves on the Leadership Board\nof the College Group.  He does not discuss with his family or anyone else what he does for a living.\nThe Applicant\u2019s mother, father and College Ministry Director testified on the Applicant\u2019s\nbehalf.  They define the Applicant has a diligent student and overall hard worker individual who has\nshown responsibility, honesty, integrity and trustworthiness.  They were all totally side-blinded when\nthey learned that he had used marijuana.  (Tr. pp. 29 - 46).  \nLetters of recommendation submitted on behalf of the Applicant from his Department\nDirector, his Pastor, and his best friend further attest to his good character, intelligence, honesty,\nhardworking and trustworthiness.  It is their opinion that with his formal education and professional\ngrowth in his career he will make numerous contributions to the security of the country.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A and B).  \nApplicant\u2019s Post Hearing Exhibit indicates that he has also recently researched the DoD\npolicies as well as his own companies policies on substance abuse and their no tolerance policies.\n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit, enclosure 2, 3 and 4).\nHis most recent completed graduate course summary represents a 3.4 GPA.  (Applicant\u2019s\nPost-Hearing Exhibit, enclosure 5).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and\nMitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\n24.  The Concern.  Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\n25. Conditions that could raise a security concern:\n(a)  any drug abuse;\n(c). illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale\nor distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\n26.  Condition that could mitigate security concerns:\n\n5\n(a).  The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness or good judgment.  \n(b).  A demonstration intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:\n(1) disassociation form drug-using associates and contacts;\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any\nviolation. \nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general\nfactors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and\nconduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order\n10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\nEligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these\npersonnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of\nvariables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence\nwhich is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\n\n6\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available\ninformation indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be involved in illegal drug use that\ndemonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has\nengaged in illegal drugs use (Guideline H).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and\nuntrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's\nconduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with her security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal,\nexplanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case under Guideline H\nof the SOR.\nThe Applicant has not used marijuana since 2004, a three year period, and he indicates that\nhe will never use it in the future.  He understands that he made a poor choice to use marijuana in the\nfirst place.  His company not only hired him as a full time engineer but awarded him with a\nfellowship, that would pay for him to obtain his Master\u2019s degree while still employed with the\ncompany.  He is a very fortunate individual who expressed embarrassment and remorse by his\nstupidity in using marijuana.  At the hearing, his demeanor was professional and his testimony is\ncredible.  His references and witnesses are believable.  Given the fact that the Applicant\u2019s drug use\noccurred a number of years ago, and there is no indication of recent problems, sufficient\nrehabilitation and mitigation has been shown. \nUnder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, Disqualifying Conditions 25 (a) any drug abuse, and\n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale or\ndistribution applies.  However mitigating conditions 26 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment; (b) a demonstrated\nintent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates\nor contacts; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any\nviolation are also applicable.  Accordingly Guideline H is found for the Applicant.\n\n7\nIn addition to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in this case, I have also considered\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  Under the particular facts of this case, the Applicant appears to have\nmatured from a college student and intern into a responsible full time working engineer, with a\nfellowship award from his employer who believes he has the potential to  make a valuable\ncontribution to our society.  I have considered the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct, the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation, the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct, his age and maturity at the time of the conduct, the voluntariness of\nparticipation, the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes, the\nmotivation of the conduct, the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  I have considered each of these factors individually and\ncollectively in reaching my overall conclusion.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's case opposing\nhis request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding for the Applicant\nas to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n  \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",
