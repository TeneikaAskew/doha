Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a decision based on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. \nThe Government\u2019s written case was submitted on March 9, 2022. A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was advised \nthat she had 30 days from her date of receipt to file objections and submit material to \nrefute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. She received the FORM on March \n21, 2022. As of April 27, 2022, she had not responded. The case was assigned to me \non May 13, 2022. The Government exhibits included in the FORM (marked as Items 1-\n8) are admitted into evidence without objection. In its FORM, Department Counsel \nwithdrew SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r and 1.s. There being no objection, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r and 1.s are stricken \nfrom the SOR.

The delinquent debts include, among other things, \nstudent loans, credit cards, medical debts, and a military overpayment. Applicant denied \nthe debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.q. She admitted the remaining debts in \nthe SOR; some with additional comment. Her admissions are adopted as findings of \nfact. I find that the SOR allegations are established through credit reports, Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, and the information she provided during her interview in September 2020. \n(Items 1, 3, 5-8) \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to bad financial decisions that her \nsecond former spouse made while they were married. She claimed that he controlled all \nof her finances and squandered almost $100,000 of her money by making bad \ninvestments. She was unemployed from February 2018 until about August 2018 after \nshe retired from the military and decided to take some time off. She was also \nunemployed from January 2019 until about July 2020 after she quit her job to move \nback home with her family because she was having financial difficulties. (Items 4, 5) \nThe $9,493 debt alleged in \u00b6 1.a has not been resolved. Applicant claimed that \nthis debt was being paid through a military allotment during an unspecified period of \ntime while she was in the military. Those payments stopped when she retired in \nFebruary 2018. She provided no documentation to support her allegation that she had \nmade payments on this account. The debt appears on Applicant\u2019s 2020, 2021, and \n2022 credit reports. (Items 1, 3, 5-8) \nThe $6,823 debt alleged in \u00b6 1.b has been resolved. Applicant\u2019s 2022 credit \nreport reflects that this account was settled for less than the full balance. (Items 1, 3, 5-\n8) \nThe student loan debts alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d have not been resolved. \nApplicant presented no documentary evidence that she has made payments, disputed \nthese debts, offered or negotiated payment agreements, or taken any significant action \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto resolve these debts.

Applicant \nclaimed that these are duplicate debts, but the information contained in the credit \nreports does not support this claim. Instead, despite having the identical balance, the \ncredit reports reflect that these two accounts had different original creditors. Applicant \npresented no documentary evidence to show that she has made payments, disputed \nthese debts, offered or negotiated payment agreements, or taken any significant action \nto resolve these debts. She also failed to provide documentary evidence showing that \nthese debts concern the same account. These debts appear on Applicant\u2019s 2020, 2021, \nand 2022 credit reports.

(Items 1, 3, 5-8) \nThe medical debts alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.n, 1.o, and 1.q have not been resolved. \nApplicant denied these debts because she didn\u2019t recognize them and has medical \ninsurance. For the medical debt listed in \u00b6 1.n, Applicant acknowledged that her \ndaughter was treated in the hospital, but that medical insurance should have covered \nany amount owed. Applicant presented no documentary evidence to show that she has \nmade payments, disputed these debts, offered or negotiated payment agreements, or \ntaken any significant action to resolve these debts. The debt described in \u00b6 1.n appears \non Applicant\u2019s 2020, 2021, and 2022 credit reports.

Applicant \npresented no documentary evidence that she has made payments, disputed this debt, \noffered or negotiated a payment agreement, or taken any significant action to resolve \nthis debt.

Applicant \npresented no documentary evidence to show that she has made payments, disputed \nthis debt, offered or negotiated a payment agreement, or taken any significant action to \nresolve this debt. This debt appears on Applicant\u2019s 2020 and 2021 credit reports, but \nnot on her 2022 credit report. (Items 1, 3, 5-7) \nThe $20,495 government overpayment described in \u00b6 1.u has not been resolved. \nThis debt resulted from Applicant receiving four to five months of full military pay after \nshe retired. Applicant claimed that she mistakenly thought these monthly credits were \nher VA benefits. When the government demanded she repay the overpayments, she did \nnot have enough money to do so. She has been repaying this debt through bi-weekly \ngarnishments. While she provided no documentary evidence of these garnishments, her \n2022 credit report reflects a diminished balance of $15,332. This debt also appears on \nher 2020 credit report, but not on her 2021 credit report. (Items 1, 3, 5, 6, 8) \nAs of September 2020, Applicant\u2019s take-home income through wages and \ndisability was $4,942 per month. Her total monthly expenses were $1,200 per month, \nleaving her with a net remainder of $3,742 per month. She claimed that she will repay \nthe delinquent debts that she thinks she owes after she investigates their validity. In \nFebruary and October 2021, Applicant opened two new installment loans secured by \nvehicles. The loan amount for these vehicles was a combined total of about $47,000. \nHer combined monthly payment on these vehicles is about $943. Applicant is no more \nthan four payments past due on an additional debt not listed in the SOR.1 Applicant did \n1 I will not consider adverse information not listed in the SOR under the disqualifying factors, but I may \nconsider it when applying matters of extenuation and mitigation, and for the whole-person analysis. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot respond to the FORM, so more recent information about her finances is not \navailable. (Items 5, 8) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective within DOD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies that includes student loans, \ncredit-card debts, medical debts, and a government overpayment. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions and shifts the burden to Applicant to \nprovide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to the actions of her ex-husband and \nhis losing money on investments. She claimed that he was controlling and had sole \nauthority over their finances. She was unemployed for several months at a time after \ntaking time off after her retirement from the military and quitting a job in order to move \nso she could live with her parents. Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s losing money on investments \nwas beyond her control. However, allowing him to have sole authority over her finances \nwas arguably within her control. Similarly, taking time off after retirement from the \nmilitary in 2018 and quitting her job in 2019 were within her control. \nApplicant provided no documentary evidence of payments or favorable resolution \nof the vast majority of the SOR debts. It is reasonable to expect Applicant to present \ndocumentation about the resolution of specific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). Her financial issues with respect to these debts are \nrecent because \u201can applicant's ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of \nconduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F \nmitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). She stated that she intends to \npay the SOR debts to the extent that she owes them. However, intentions to pay debts \nin the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other \nresponsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income evidences that she has the necessary funds to \npay back at least some of her creditors. Instead, she has decided to incur additional \ndebt by purchasing two vehicles. Despite having the income to pay her expenses, she \nhas also become delinquent on an additional debt not listed in the SOR. Under the \ncircumstances, this conduct is not responsible, nor does it show a good-faith effort to \npay her overdue creditors \nCredit reports evidence that Applicant has settled one of her debts for less than \nthe full amount and has paid down the government overpayment. However, Applicant \nacknowledged that she has paid down the government overpayment through a \ngarnishment. Debts repaid through a garnishment are not normally considered good-\nfaith attempts to resolve a debt. \nApplicant disputed some of the SOR debts. However, she provided no \ndocumentary evidence to substantiate the basis of her disputes. She also did not \nprovide evidence of actions she took to resolve any of her disputes. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that she made a good-faith effort to pay her \ndebts. She presented no evidence to show she has participated in financial counseling \nor has a working budget. Her ongoing financial issues continue to cast doubt on her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nmilitary service as well as her deployment to Iraq. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.q: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.r-1.s: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.t-1.u: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He married the mother \nof his four children in 2000. Although scant on details, the record indicates that they have \nbeen separated since about 2016.

(Items 1, 2; Item 3 at 6 \nand 9) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state tax income \ntax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018. It also alleged a $2,350 delinquent federal \nincome tax debt for tax year 2019 and four other delinquent debts totaling $4,648.

I made these debts and I accept full responsibility and consequences for \nwhat lead to my action.\u201d (Item 2) \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2017 and 2018, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a (federal), 1.c (State A), and 1.d (State B). In \nApril 2019, the IRS granted him an extension to October 2019 to file his 2018 return. He \ndid not request an extension for his 2017 return. He was required to file 2018 returns in \ntwo states due to his May 2018 relocation from State A to State B. He filed his 2017 and \n2018 returns on May 24, 2021, and then timely filed his 2019 and 2020 returns. (AE I, J; \nItem 1 at 3; Item 3 at 6, 13, 17, 18) \nIn February 2018, Applicant sought advice from a tax professional after he learned \nthat his spouse claimed their children as her dependents on her 2017 tax return. He was \nadvised that he could not also claim their children on his 2017 tax return. The tax \nprofessional estimated that he would owe taxes of about $7,000 and advised him to file \nhis 2017 return and then set up a payment plan for the amount owed.

However, in his FORM response, Applicant \nstated: \nWaiting to take care of my issues was wrong but at the time I was financially \nnot able to do anything because I was going through personal problems that \nled me not to fulfill my obligations. Not filing my taxes for 2017 and 2018 is \nthe first and only time I have ever missed filing my taxes. I know there is no \nexcuse that is good enough to not file taxes and for that I am truly sorry.

I will consider those debts only to evaluate mitigation and \nthe whole-person concept. As alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, he also failed to pay federal income \ntaxes for tax year 2019, the balance of which was $2,350 as of October 2021. The record \ndid not indicate whether he has any state tax debt. In April 2021, the IRS transferred a \n$2,807 credit from his account to a 2016 federal tax debt and applied his tax year 2020 \nrefund of $1,804 to unspecified \u201cnon-IRS debt.\u201d In his Answer, Applicant attributed his \n2019 tax debt to his filing status being incorrect. He asserted that he \u201cmade some \ncorrections to fix that problem\u201d and was \u201cin the process of trying to pay everything off.\u201d \nHe stated: \u201cI know its [sic] going to take some time, but I am going to make sure everything \nis paid off because this is the first and only time, I have ever done anything like this.\u201d (AE \nI, J; Item 1; Item 3 at 17, 18) \nThe $3,837 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e is a military exchange credit-card account \nthat was placed for collection. Applicant used the card to help pay household bills and to \nbuy clothes and shoes for his children. The debt is being paid through $60 monthly \ngarnishments of Applicant\u2019s military retirement pay. In his answer, Applicant stated that \nhe was making payments in addition to the garnishment. However, he did not specify the \namounts of those payments or proffer any documents to corroborate them. A February \n2022 credit report showed a reduced balance of $3,744. (AE D at 27; Item 1 at 3; Item 2 \nat 40; Item 6 at 17-18; Item 3 at 10; Item 4 at 2; Item 5 at 2) \nThe $340 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f is a bill from a 2019 emergency room visit that \nwas placed for collection. Applicant was surprised by the bill because he thought it would \nhave been paid in full by either Tricare or his U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \ndisability benefits.

He also confirmed seven other delinquent \ndebts totaling $8,137 (9) that were apparently listed on a credit report not included in the \nrecord.

During that period, \nhe gave up and stopped taking care of his financial responsibilities, which he found \noverwhelming.

(Item 2 at 39-41; Item 3 at 11; Item 6 at\n6) \n \n \n \nDuring his SI, Applicant proffered a plan to engage the services of a credit \ncounseling firm to assist him with resolving his delinquent debts. At that time, he was \nmaintaining two households: his in State B, and his wife and children in State A. He \nrelocated to State B for employment with better pay. He intended to use the increased \nincome to \u201cpay off all of his debt and provide a good life for himself and his family.\u201d He \nwas unable to provide a specific timeframe for a full debt resolution at that time. The \nrecord did not indicate whether he ever engaged the services of that firm. (Item 3 at 11) \nIn a February 2021 personal financial statement (PFS), Applicant reported an \n$8,073 monthly net income, including $1,194 military retirement pay and $3,931 VA \ndisability pay. He estimated a $2,535 monthly net remainder. His two February 2021 \npaystubs revealed that he took out a 401k loan at some point, for which he was repaying \n$119 per pay period, and that his pay was being garnished for child support in the amount \nof $530 per pay period. There was no other information in the record about his child \nsupport obligation. Applicant provided three recent credit reports, one from each credit \nbureau agency, dated February 2022. They revealed that he opened 14 new credit \naccounts in the last two years. (AE D-F; Item 6 at 9-11) \nIn his FORM response, Applicant stated: \nI enjoy what I do and working alongside America\u2019s warfighters [fills] a void \nthat was created when I took off the uniform.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations); and AG \u00b6 19(f) \n(failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required). \nHaving considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nconcern under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nBecause Applicant eventually filed his 2017 and 2018 returns in May 2021 and \ntimely filed his subsequent returns, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(g) applies in part. His choice to ignore his \nobligation to timely file his 2017 returns to avoid a tax bill was not excusable. It \ndemonstrated poor judgment and a willingness to place his own self-interest above his \nlegal obligations, which casts doubt as to whether he may also act similarly in the context \nof his security obligations. Thus, AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. While he indicated that he \nhas been working to resolve at least his 2019 tax debt, he did not establish that he made \npayment arrangements with the IRS and is in compliance with those arrangements for \ntax year 2019 or the other tax years. As a result, AG \u00b6 20(g) is not fully established. \nAccordingly, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d against Applicant. \nWith respect to his delinquent debts, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.h in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. AG \u00b6 20(e) is established as to SOR \u00b6 1.f. and AG \u00b6 20(d) is established as to SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h. Because it is being resolved via a wage garnishment, AG \u00b6 20(d) is not \nestablished as to SOR \u00b6 1.e. It is also not mitigated by any of the other relevant factors \ndue to Applicant\u2019s underlying history of indebtedness that continues to persist, of which \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a part. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies to the extent that Applicant\u2019s debts were attributable to his \nseparation from his wife and the period when he struggled with his mental health following \nhis Iraq deployment. However, I am unable to fully apply AG \u00b6 20(b) because the record \nlacked sufficient detail for me to conclude that his debts have persisted largely due to \nthose circumstances or that he acted responsibly to resolve his debts. He also attributed \nhis indebtedness to \u201cnot making enough,\u201d but his relevant income and expense history \nwas not fully developed by the record. He reported gainful employment with a $2,535 net \nremainder as of February 2021. \nNot only did Applicant fail to establish that he resolved any of his tax debts, he \ncontinues to rely heavily on credit to meet his expenses, as evidenced by the 14 new \ncredit accounts he opened in the last two years. The record also suggests that he has \nother delinquent debts that were not alleged in the SOR. He is credited with paying $552 \nto resolve SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h and approximately $3,453 towards some of his non-SOR \ndebts. However, he did not demonstrate that he has control of his finances or that his \nindebtedness is unlikely to recur. He may be able to overcome the security concerns at \nsome future date should he successfully resolve his indebtedness to the IRS and others. \nHowever, based on the evidence before me, I cannot conclude that Applicant has \nprovided sufficient evidence to fully mitigate the Guideline F concerns at this time. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Formal Findings \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) and Applicant\u2019s distinguished service as a \ncombat veteran. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nthat Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts and \nfailure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns. Accordingly, Applicant has \nnot carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f \u2013 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant or continue Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He did not respond to the FORM, so more recent information about his \nfinances is not available. (Items 1, 3-6) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective within DOD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies, including an unpaid automobile \nloan, unpaid student loans, an unpaid personal loan, and unpaid damages pursuant to a \nresidential lease. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions \nand shifts the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to the Government shutdown in 2012 \nleading to his loss of employment, failing to remember to pay bills, and unspecified poor \nbusiness decisions. Applicant\u2019s unemployment was beyond his control. Applicant\u2019s \nfailing to remember to pay his bills and making poor business decisions were within his \ncontrol. \nApplicant provided no documentary evidence of payments or favorable resolution \nof the SOR debts. Applicant stated that he intends to pay some of the SOR debts. \nHowever, intentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of \ndebt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nApplicant wrote in his SOR response that he has paid some of the debts listed in \nthe SOR, but he provided no documents to corroborate his payments of these debts. It \nis reasonable to expect Applicant to present documentation about the resolution of \nspecific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). \nWhile Applicant claimed to have hired an attorney to help him resolve his \nfinancial issues, he has not provided evidence of who this attorney is or what the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nattorney has done to help. Therefore, I cannot determine whether his counseling is from \na legitimate and credible source or that the financial issues are being resolved.  \nApplicant disputed that he owes some of the SOR debts. However, for each of \nthese debts, he either fails to provide documented proof to substantiate the basis of his \ndispute, or he fails to provide evidence of his efforts to resolve the issue. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

On November 12, 2021, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DODCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline H.

He also provided additional information to support his \nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is 27 years old, recently married, and has no children.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nAppellant smoked marijuana about 60 times over a period of about ten years \nfrom 2010~2020. He also purchased marijuana on one occasion. He also used cocaine \nand MDMA during the 2016~2017 timeframe. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), and (c) are \nestablished. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nThese do not apply. Applicant\u2019s last marijuana usage was less than two years \nago (only a year prior to the issuance of the SOR), and was subsequent to Applicant \nobtaining his current employment. Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is found \nagainst Applicant. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires each case must be judged on its own merits. Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is well respected in the \nworkplace and in his community. (AppXs B~D.) However, overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from his drug involvement and substance abuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. However, pursuant to his statement of intent, eschewing future \ndrug involvement; coupled with another year of non-usage, Applicant may be eligible for \na security clearance in the future. At present, however, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

Applicant also claimed that he did \nnot realize that his student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h were delinquent \nbecause he paid these student loans on time every month. During a follow-up phone \ncall with the investigator in August 2020, Applicant claimed that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.c, and 1.g were fraudulently opened in his name. He claimed that he contacted \nthe fraud department for each of these creditors and each opened a fraud investigation. \nApplicant also claimed that he contacted Equifax and informed them of this fraud. \nApplicant claimed that a representative from Equifax told him that it would remove the \naccounts from his credit report. According to Applicant, he asked representatives from \nthese creditors and Equifax to provide him with documentation showing he is not \nresponsible for these accounts. Applicant claimed that he did not list the SOR accounts \non his SF 86 because he did not know they existed or did not believe they were \ndelinquent. He also alleged that he had paid off the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.i, but no \ndocumentation corroborating this payment is in evidence. Finally, he claimed that he \ndecided to \u201ctransfer\u201d his student loans to another creditor, and that he had begun that \nprocess. (Items 1, 2, 5-9) \nDuring a follow-up December 2020 interview, despite earlier claiming that he had \nno credit cards, Applicant volunteered that the accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.g are \nhis accounts.

He stated that he hired an attorney to help \nhim dispute these allegedly fraudulent charges. During this interview, he claimed for the \nfirst time that he did not list these charges on his SF 86 because his attorney told him \nthat he only needed to list debts for which he was responsible. Applicant also \nacknowledged being delinquent on his student loans. This time, he stated that he did \nnot list these debts as being delinquent on his SF 86 because they did not come to mind \nwhen he was filling it out. He stated that he now understands that he should have listed \nthese debts on his SF 86. He claimed that he will resolve all the SOR debts. (Items 1, 2, \n5-10) \nIn his March 2021 interrogatory responses, Applicant claimed that he has paid all \nthe debts in the SOR and that he provided documents to corroborate that he has paid \nthese debts. However, the documents in the record do not support his claim of \npayments. Applicant provided an undated portion of a Credit Karma credit report that \nreflects that the SOR debts are \u201cclosed.\u201d This portion of a credit report does not explain \nthe reason the SOR debts are listed as closed, nor does it provide any evidence that the \nSOR debts were closed because Applicant paid them. The document also does not \nshow that the accounts were closed because they were fraudulently opened or that \nfraudulent charges were made on them. Applicant provided no documentation to \nsupport his allegations of fraud with respect to the credit-card accounts listed in the \nSOR. The only entry in a credit report that reflects a dispute with any of these accounts \nappears in the December 2020 and April 2021 credit reports submitted by the \nGovernment with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.a, and states that the account information is \ndisputed by the consumer. All of the SOR debts appear as collections or charged off on \nall three of the credit reports provided by the Government. (Items 1, 2, 4, 9, 10) \nApplicant provided a document from a creditor that arguably shows an attempt to \nrefinance the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, and 1.h. However, this document does not show \nthat the debts were successfully refinanced, nor does it show that these debts were \npaid. Applicant also provided a March 18, 2021 pay stub, a financial statement reflecting \nhis income and expenses, and bank statements from a checking account that do not \nspecifically address the SOR debts. Applicant did not respond to the FORM, so more \nrecent information regarding his finances is not part of this record. (Items 1, 2, 4, 9, 10) \nIn November 2020, Applicant was issued a final written warning by his employer \nfor violating its code of conduct. Applicant had to be confronted with the written warning \nby an investigator during a January 2021 phone interview.1 Applicant claimed that he \nwas given the written warning because his employer thought that he was not timely \nresponding to e-mails and requests for information relating to his security clearance. \nApplicant claimed he did nothing wrong and has been working with his union \nrepresentative to have the warning removed from his record. He claimed that he did not \n1 Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR, such as Applicant receiving a written warning from his \nemployer or failing to volunteer the written warning to the investigator, cannot be used for disqualification \npurposes.

(Item 10) \nIn the SOR, under Guideline E, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s failure to \ndisclose all of the SOR debts he was required to in his SF 86. Applicant denied the \nGuideline E allegations with additional comments. (Items 1-10) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had several financial delinquencies totaling approximately $56,000. \nThese delinquencies included student loans and credit cards. The evidence is sufficient \nto raise the above disqualifying conditions and shifts the burden to Applicant to provide \nevidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.     \nApplicant alleged that he has paid or resolved all of the debts listed in the SOR, \nbut he provided insufficient documentation to corroborate his payments or resolution of \nthese debts. Instead, his documents list his SOR accounts as \u201cclosed\u201d without further \namplification of why they were closed, such as through payment or because of fraud. It \nis reasonable to expect Applicant to present documentation about the resolution of \nspecific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). He \nhas not done so and has therefore failed to show that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \nWhile Applicant claimed to have hired an attorney to help him resolve his \nfinancial issues, he has not provided evidence of what the attorney has done to help. \nMoreover, he has not provided documentation corroborating the resolution of any of his \ndebts. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence that the financial issues are being \nresolved. \nApplicant disputed that he owes some of the SOR debts or a portion thereof. He \nhas made inconsistent claims that the SOR accounts were fraudulently opened in his \nname, that charges on his accounts were fraudulently made, and that he was not \ndelinquent on his debts. However, for each of these disputes, he either fails to provide \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of his dispute, or he fails to provide \nsufficient evidence of his efforts to resolve the issue. For example, he provided no \ndocuments regarding his fraud claims with his creditors or the credit reporting agencies. \nHe also changed his stance on what fraud, if any, was involved with his SOR credit-card \naccounts. Despite initially claiming that his student loans were in good standing, he later \nadmitted they were delinquent. He also failed to provide sufficient documentation \nconfirming that he had resolved his student loan delinquencies. Instead, he merely \nprovided documents that showed he was in the process of refinancing them. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant failed to list his aforementioned delinquent student loans and credit \ncards on his SF 86 despite being required to do so. His justifications for failing to list his \ndelinquencies are inconsistent. Initially, he claimed that he did not list his delinquent \ncredit-card accounts because he had no credit cards. Later, he acknowledged the \ncredit-card accounts were his, but claimed they were fraudulently opened. \nSubsequently, he admitted the credit-card accounts were his, but that some of the \ncharges were fraudulent, and an attorney advised him not to list the fraudulent \naccounts. With respect to his student loans, he initially claimed he did not list them on \nhis SF 86 because he did not believe they were delinquent. Later, he admitted they \nwere delinquent, but that it did not occur to him to list them. These inconsistencies and \nshifting explanations detract from the veracity of his statements. Without being able to \nassess Applicant\u2019s credibility through his testimony, the inconsistencies cause me to \nquestion Applicant\u2019s truthfulness regarding his justifications for his omissions. I therefore \nfind that Applicant deliberately omitted these delinquencies from his SF 86 and the \nabove disqualifying condition is established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant\u2019s case: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. Applicant failed to disclose the delinquent debts in \nhis SOR until after his investigator confronted him. Even after Applicant began to freely \ndiscuss his delinquencies, his explanations for the debts\u2019 origination, status, and \nresolution were inconsistent to the point of appearing untruthful. \nAG \u00b6 17(b) does not apply. Applicant claimed during a December 2020 interview \nthat he did not list his credit-card debts based on the advice of an attorney he hired \nbecause they were fraudulent. He did not mention this legal advice as a reason for \nfailing to list these debts during his first two interviews. Instead, during his first interview, \nhe claimed that he did not have any credit cards. Without a logical explanation for the \nchange, he later acknowledged that all the SOR credit cards were his. This failure to \nmention an attorney\u2019s advice for four months after not alleging it during two prior \ninterviews significantly undermines the veracity of that evidence. Instead, it suggests an \nattempt to falsely manufacture mitigating evidence. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply to Applicant\u2019s falsifications. Falsification of an SF 86 \nis not \u201cminor\u201d because it \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011). Additionally, there is evidence that \nApplicant was again less than forthcoming with an investigator in January 2021 when he \nhad to be confronted with his employer\u2019s November 2020 written warning. In light of all \nof his other inconsistencies and evolving justifications for his behavior, his explanation \nthat the warning was not \u201cofficial\u201d is not satisfactory. These factors undermine \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to show that his deceptive or untruthful behavior is infrequent or \nunlikely to recur and cast doubt on his reliability, truthfulness, and good judgment. \nPersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. \nThe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the \nfinancial considerations or personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(Item 1 at 4-6.) \nIn his Answer, he admitted all the allegations in the SOR. His Answer included additional \ninformation and attachments. (Item 1 at 7-9.) \nOn March 16, 2022, Department Counsel submitted the Department\u2019s written case. \nA complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), consisting of Items 1 to 4, was \nprovided to Applicant, who received the file on March 22, 2022. \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant elected not to submit any \nadditional information. The case was assigned to me on June 21, 2022. Based upon a \nreview of the pleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 58 years old, married for the second time, and has two children. He \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor \nsince December 2019 and seeks to obtain national security eligibility and a security \nclearance in connection with his employment. He worked as a Federal employee for one \nof the military services as a manager from 1997 until he retired in October 2019. (Item 2 \nat Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has engaged in criminal conduct that creates doubt about a person\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant admitted all the allegations under this \nparagraph. All the statements of fact regarding the allegations are from a Report of \nInvestigation (ROI) prepared by an authorized investigator of the Office of Personnel \nManagement after an interview with Applicant taken under oath, except as otherwise \nstated. Applicant agreed to the accuracy and truthfulness of the ROI in DOHA \ninterrogatories signed by him on August 3, 2021. (Item 4,) \n1.a. Applicant was arrested in July 2011 and charged with Driving Under the \nInfluence (DUI). He stated that the court sentenced him to a pre-trial diversion program \nand his driver\u2019s license was suspended. He also had to perform community service, \nattend Mothers Against Drunk Drivers presentations, and take a drivers\u2019 education \ncourse. He stated that after completing the diversion program the charges were dismissed \nand expunged. When questioned as to why this arrest was not set forth in his 2020 e-\nQIP, discussed below, he stated that he had self-reported it at the time, and he believed \nthe Government should know about it.

Applicant admitted that he was arrested in April 2017 and charged with \nDisorderly Conduct. He stated this incident was the result of an argument between his \nwife and a restaurant owner, eventually both he and his wife were arrested. He further \nstated that the court dismissed the charges after one year of no interaction with the \nrestaurant. Applicant stated he could not remember whether he self-reported this incident. \nHe further stated that he did not report this incident on his security questionnaire because \nhe did not think it was required. (Item 4 at 11-12.) \n1.c. Applicant admitted that he was charged in July 2019 with a Warrant, \nCommunicating a Threat. During a verbal argument with his wife he stated that he would \nkill her after she communicated a threat to cut off his penis while he slept. The police were \ncalled and Applicant was arrested. He stated that the court initia\n \nlly found him guilty. Two \nweeks later, on a petition from his wife, the charges were dismissed. He stated that he \ndid not report this incident on his security questionnaire because the case was dismissed. \n(Item 4 at 10-11.) \n1.d. Applicant admitted that he was arrested in August 2019 and charged with DUI. \nHe was arrested after attending his own retirement party. In February 2020 he was \nconvicted. He spent two days in jail, paid a fine, his driver\u2019s license was suspended for \n90 days, and he was placed on one year\u2019s unsupervised probation. Applicant stated that \nhe did report this arrest to his Federal civilian employer as required. He did not report it \non his security questionnaire since he did self-report it, and he believed the Government \nshould know about it. (Item 4 at 9-10.) \n1.e. Applicant admitted that he was arrested in July 2020 for Harassment and \nSimple Assault. The charges were in regard to two fights between Applicant and his wife. \nAccording to Applicant all the charges were eventually dismissed by the court with no \nfindings. (Item 4 at 8-9.)  \n1.f. Applicant admitted that he was arrested in August 2020 and charged with \nPublic Intoxication. He was issued a citation, and immediately paid the $300 fine. (Item 4 \nat 7-8.) \n1.g. Applicant admitted that he was arrested in April 2021 and charged with DUI. \nHe was found guilty and ordered to perform community service and attend alcohol \ntreatment. Attached to his Answer is documentation from the treatment center showing \nthat he had successfully completed a 30-hour outpatient program on August 17, 2021. \n(Item 1 at 7-9; Item 4 at 17-18.) \nThere is no documentation from any court or law enforcement agency in the record \nto support Applicant\u2019s statements regarding the disposition of any of these offenses. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he consumes intoxicants to excess. Applicant admitted this allegation. \nApplicant had previously admitted to the facts of the four alcohol-related arrests \ndescribed under subparagraphs 1.a, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g. He stated in his responses to \nInterrogatories that he stopped drinking in April 2021 after his last DUI arrest. As noted \nabove, he has successfully completed a drug and alcohol education and treatment \nprogram. (Item 1 at 7-9; Item 4 at 17-18.) \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has falsified material facts during the clearance screening process. Applicant \nadmitted both allegations under this paragraph with explanations. \nApplicant submitted an e-QIP on May 29, 2020. (Item 3.) Section 22 of that \nquestionnaire concerns Applicant\u2019s Police Record. As a preliminary matter it states, \u201cFor \nthis section report information regardless of whether the record in your case has been \nsealed, expunged, or otherwise stricken from the court record, or the charge was \ndismissed.\u201d \n3.a. One subpart of that section asked Applicant to set forth criminal conduct within \nseven years of the date of the questionnaire. The question asked specifically whether he \nhad received a summons, citation, or ticket. It also asked whether he had been charged, \nconvicted, or sentenced of a crime. Applicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d This was a false answer to \nrelevant questions about Applicant\u2019s criminal history. Applicant stated in his Answer, \u201cI \nadmit, but thought question was asking for unreported arrests.\u201d (Item 1 at 5.) \n3.b. A second subpart of Section 22 asked Applicant, in part, \u201cHave you EVER \nbeen convicted of an offense involving domestic violence or a crime of violence (such as \nbattery or assault) against your . . . cohabitant, spouse or legally recognized civil union \ndomestic partner\u201d and, \u201cHave you EVER been charged with any offense involving alcohol \nor drugs?\u201d (All emphasis in original.) Applicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d This was also a false \nanswer to relevant questions concerning Applicant\u2019s criminal history. Applicant stated in \nhis Answer, \u201cI admit, but thought this was asking for any unreported. Everything was \nreported to my supervisor at time of arrest.\u201d (Item 1 at 5.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for criminal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 30, which states: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant had a history of criminal conduct between 2011 and 2021. Both of the \nabove disqualifying conditions have application in this case. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 32 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged criminal conduct. Two have possible application \nto the facts of this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s last arrest occurred in April 2021, a little over a year ago. Applicant \nsubmitted no evidence concerning his performance on the job or constructive community \ninvolvement. There is a paucity of evidence from which to find that Applicant has met \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neither of the mitigating conditions with regard to his history of criminal conduct. Paragraph \n1 is found against Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for alcohol consumption are set out \nin AG \u00b6 21, which states: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant has had four alcohol-related arrests, including three for Driving Under \nthe Influence of alcohol, between 2011 and 2021. The above disqualifying condition \napplies to this case. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 23 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant stated that he stopped drinking after his April 2021 DUI arrest. He also \nsubmitted evidence that he had successfully completed an outpatient alcohol-treatment \nprogram. Given his history of alcohol-related incidents, a year of sobriety is insufficient to \nshow that he has mitigated the security significance of his alcohol history. Paragraph 2 is \nfound against Applicant. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant falsified his latest security clearance questionnaire in answering \nquestions about his criminal history. The above disqualifying condition has application to \nthis case. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged falsification: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant seems to be making two arguments. One, he states that he told his \nsupervisors about his arrests, therefore he did not need to disclose them because the \nGovernment already knew about them. Second, he argued that he did not have to \ndisclose them because the charges were dismissed or dropped. Neither argument has \nmerit. Section 22 is clear and unambiguous. As a preliminary matter it states that all \nrelevant criminal actions must be set forth, whether they were dismissed or not. Secondly, \nthere is no exception to the rule because the person has allegedly told their superior. \nApplicant had a more than 20-year history as a civilian employee for one of the military \nservices. He knew or should have known about his disclosure obligations. No mitigation \nis shown. Paragraph 3 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his criminal conduct, personal conduct, and alcohol abuse. He has \nnot minimized the potential for pressure, coercion, or duress. He has also not shown that \nthere is little likelihood of recurrence. Overall, the record evidence creates substantial \ndoubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security \nclearance. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3: Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

He presented sufficient documentation to support his burden of proof. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 6, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Adjudicative Guideline F \n(financial considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. Applicant responded to the \nSOR and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material \n(FORM) on September 28, 2021. Applicant received the FORM on October 11, 2021, \n2021. Applicant responded to the FORM (Item 7). The Government\u2019s evidence, included \n1 \n\nin the FORM and identified as Items 1 through 6, is admitted without objection. The \ncase was assigned to me on January 6, 2022.

In 2019, he stopped dealing with \nthem and worked with the creditors directly. \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he has been working to resolve \nhis debts. His credit report (Item 6) confirms that he has maintained regular monthly \npayments on some accounts for about 14 months. He also has resolved two other \naccounts. He did not provide documentation when he answered the SOR. \nApplicant stated, in his subject interview (Item 4) that he was unemployed from \n2010 to 2012, while he was a student. He was supported by his family. He also \nacknowledged that he was young and not responsible with the credit cards, but he has \nlearned. \nAs to SOR 1.a, a charged-off account in the amount of $2,049, Applicant \nprovided documentation in response to the FORM that the account has been settled. \n(Item 7) The debt has been cancelled. \nAs to SOR 1.b, a charged-off account in the amount of $16,193, Applicant has \nbeen paying $163 a month consistently since March 2020. (Item 5) His credit report \nconfirms the information. \nAs to SOR 1.c, a collection account in the approximate amount of $40,741, \nApplicant has not settled the debt, but he is paying $100 a month toward a resolution of \nthe debt.

(Item 7) \nApplicant was young and admitted to not being responsible in those years. \nHowever, he has been working to resolve his debts prior to the security clearance \nprocess. He disclosed his financial situation. He has taken concrete steps to resolve \ndelinquent accounts and provided documentation concerning his efforts. He did not \nrealize at first that the debt consolidation company would not give him good advice. He \nhas shown that he has a plan for each debt that he incurred. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), \nand 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \n4 \n\nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted, and his credit reports confirm, that he is responsible for the \ndelinquent debts that started in 2016 and 2017. He obtained the services of a debt \nmanagement company, but learned that their advice to stop paying on the accounts and \nlet them go to default was damaging to him. He has learned from his mistakes and is \nactively addressing the accounts. He has shown that he can maintain consistent \nmonthly payments. \nBased on the evidence produced by Applicant, it is concluded he made a \nsufficient good-faith effort to resolve his debts. He is beginning a meaningful track \nrecord of financial responsibility. He has met his burden and some of the mitigating \nconditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \n5 \n\n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence presented shows that Applicant has realized the \nimportance of financial responsibility and continues to address and resolve the various \ncredit accounts. Eligibility is granted. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u20131.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 40-year-old public affairs specialist employed by a federal contractor since December 2016. He attended a university from September 2012 to May 2016 but did not receive a degree. He served in the Army National Guard from February 2005 to June 2016 and was honorably discharged as a staff sergeant (pay grade E-6). He has never married and has no children. His SCA reflects that he has never held a security clearance. (FORM Item 2 at 27-28.) Applicant disclosed in his SCA that he had not filed his federal and state income tax returns since December 2016, and that he owed an estimated $5,000 in taxes. He did not specify whether his tax debt was federal, state, or both. (FORM Item 2 at 28.) In response to DOHA interrogatories, he stated that he had not filed his federal and state tax returns for tax years 2016 through 2020. He did not know whether he owed any federal taxes.

He received the FORM on January 4, 2022, but did not respond. The case was \nassigned to me on March 17, 2022.  \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j and \ndenied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.k. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old public affairs specialist employed by a federal contractor \nsince December 2016. He attended a university from September 2012 to May 2016 but \ndid not receive a degree. He served in the Army National Guard from February 2005 to \nJune 2016 and was honorably discharged as a staff sergeant (pay grade E-6). He has \nnever married and has no children. His SCA reflects that he has never held a security \nclearance. (FORM Item 2 at 27-28.) \nApplicant disclosed in his SCA that he had not filed his federal and state income \ntax returns since December 2016, and that he owed an estimated $5,000 in taxes. He did \nnot specify whether his tax debt was federal, state, or both. (FORM Item 2 at 28.) In \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories, he stated that he had not filed his federal and state \ntax returns for tax years 2016 through 2020. He did not know whether he owed any federal \ntaxes. He stated that he owed state taxes and did not know how much he owed in state \ntaxes, but he declared, \u201cI assume a lot.\u201d (FORM Item 3 at 3-5.) When he was interviewed \nby a security investigator, he stated that he did not file his federal and state returns for \n2016 because his income was too low to require him to pay taxes. He stated that he did \nnot file his federal and state returns for subsequent years because he was working on \npersonal development and focusing on other things. (FORM Item 3 at 8.) His failures to \nfile federal and state income tax returns are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \nCredit reports from December 2020 and December 2021 (FORM Items 4 and 5) \nreflect eight student loans placed for collection totaling $50,151. The last activity on all \nthese loans was in April 2017. They were all placed for collection and assigned to the \ngovernment in December 2020. Applicant told a security investigator that he had not \nmade any effort to resolve them. (FORM Item 3 at 10.) The delinquent student loans are \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.j, which Applicant admitted. \nThe December 2021 credit report (FORM Item 5) reflects a credit-card account \nthat was charged off for $2,763 in May 2016. Applicant told the security investigator that \nhe was unaware that it was charged off. (FORM Item 3 at 8.) He submitted no evidence \nof efforts to resolve the debt. The debt is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k. Applicant denied this \nallegation but provided no evidence or explanation to support his denial. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nNone of these mitigating conditions are applicable. Applicant\u2019s financial \ndelinquencies are recent, numerous, and were not incurred under conditions making \nrecurrence unlikely. He submitted no evidence of conditions largely beyond his control, \nno evidence of counseling, no evidence disputing the debts, or evidence of efforts to \nresolve them. \nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act \n(CARES Act) became law, and it provided for relief measures on Department of Education \n(DoEd)-owned federal student loans through September 30, 2020. The CARES act \nprovided for automatic forbearance and zero interest charges during the forbearance. The \nmost recent extension of forbearance was on January 20, 2021, when it was extended to \nloans through May 1, 2022. Appellant\u2019s student loans became delinquent in 2017, well \nbefore the forbearance went into effect. I am not satisfied that he will pay his delinquent \nstudent loans when they are no longer in forbearance. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nmilitary service. I have also considered that failure to file tax returns suggests that an \napplicant has a problem with complying with well-established governmental rules and \nsystems. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) Because Applicant \nrequested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to \nevaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 \nat 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nunder Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his failure to file \nfederal and state income tax returns and failure to address his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Department Counsel was ready to proceed on December \n17, 2021. Scheduling of the hearing was delayed by COVID-19. The case was assigned \nto me on September 6, 2022. On September 20, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled to be conducted \nby video teleconference on October 13, 2022. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 10 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified but did not present the testimony of any other witnesses or submit any \ndocumentary evidence. I kept the record open until October 29, 2022, to enable him to \nsubmit documentary evidence. He timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A and B, \nwhich were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 25, \n2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h \nand 2.b. He did not expressly admit or deny SOR \u00b6 2.a, which cross-alleges SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g. He admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b, but with \nexplanations that amount to denials. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of \nfact. \nApplicant is a 33-year-old mechanical technician employed by a defense \ncontractor since June 2008. He graduated from high school and attended some college \ncourses but did not receive a degree. (Tr. 21.) He has held a security clearance since \nJuly 2009. He married in March 2017 and separated in December 2019. He has no \nchildren. \nIn May 2008, Applicant was charged with carnal knowledge of a child, a felony. He \nwas 19 years old, was dating a 15-year-old girl, and had a sexual relationship with her. \nThe girl\u2019s sister told their parents about the relationship. He pleaded guilty to contributing \nto the delinquency of a minor, a misdemeanor. He was sentenced to eight weekends in \njail. (GX 10.) During an ESI in June 2018, Applicant told a security investigator the he did \nnot think he was doing anything wrong, because the girl\u2019s mother consented to their \nrelationship. (GX 4 at 18.) \nIn July 2008, Applicant was convicted of being a minor in possession of alcohol. \nHe was required to complete 50 hours of community service. \nIn November 2008, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor driving while \nintoxicated (DWI). He was convicted and served two weekends in jail. \nIn July 2009, Applicant was charged with failure to appear in court. He was \nconvicted and required to pay restitution. (GX 9 at 4.) At the hearing, he could not \nremember missing a court date, but he accepted the fact that court records reflected the \noffense.

He \npleaded guilty to DWI and was sentenced to a $250 fine and 6 months in jail, with 5 \nmonths and 25 days suspended, He served two weekends in jail. (GX 8; GX 9 at 5.) \nIn February 2016, Applicant was suspended from work for three days because he \noverslept due to alcohol consumption and missed his flight to a job location. He overslept \nafter drinking and arrived at the airport too late to check in. Someone else took his place \non the flight, and he switched places with his replacement two weeks later. (Tr. 24-25.) \nIn May 2018, Applicant was cited for urinating in public. He pleaded guilty and paid \na $60 fine. (GX 7.) \nIn August 2019, Applicant was charged with DWI, 2nd  offense. He had been \ndrinking, took the wrong exit off a highway, and ended up at the gate of a military \ninstallation where he could not turn around. He was arrested, pleaded guilty, was placed \non probation for 12 months, and was sentenced to ten days in jail, which he served on \nfour weekends. The terms of his probation included refraining from excessive use of \nalcohol, and he was required to complete an alcohol safety action program (ASAP). (GX \n6; Tr. 18-19.) He did not report this conduct to his employer until he went to court. His \nemployer suspended him without pay for a \u201cfew days\u201d for failure to report the incident. (Tr. \n27.) \nIn July 2020, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor public drunkenness. This \nincident occurred when he went to a friend\u2019s house, found that the friend was not at home, \nand discovered that his cellphone was dead. He lingered around the house, \u201ctrying to \nfigure out how to get home.\u201d Neighbors were suspicious and called the police. The police \narrived, smelled alcohol, and arrested him. He had consumed about eight beers and a \nshot of alcohol. (Tr. 12-15.) He pleaded guilty, paid a $15 fine, and his probation for the \nAugust 2019 DWI was extended for six months. (GX 5.) He reported this incident to his \nemployer, having learned his lesson for not reporting the August 2019 incident. (Tr. 27.) \nApplicant testified that he has abstained from alcohol since this incident in July \n2020. (Tr. 12.) He testified that he had attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings \u201cin \nand out\u201d since 2019. His last AA meeting was in 2021. He stopped attending AA meetings \nbecause he believed that he was finally on the right path. In 2020, he attended counseling \nfor about two months. He knows he has a drinking problem. He testified, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say \nI\u2019m dependent on alcohol. I mean, I \u2013it\u2019s just, once I start, it\u2019s always been difficult for me \nto stop. It always go extreme. And sadly enough, it took all this trouble for me to start \nrealizing that I needed to make changes.\u201d (Tr. 20.) \nApplicant does not keep alcohol in his house.

(GX 3 at 33.) \nDuring a personal subject interview (PSI) in May 2009, Applicant told the \ninvestigator that he did not disclose the carnal knowledge charge in his SCA because he \nwas told by an unknown person that his record would be cleared if he completed his \ncommunity service after his arrest for underage possession of alcohol.

(GX 4 at 18.) \nApplicant submitted a third SCA in August 2020. In response to the same question \nabout ever being charged with a felony, he again answered \u201cNo,\u201d and he again failed to \ndisclose the felony charge of carnal knowledge in May 2008. (GX 1 at 31.) In his answer \nto the SOR, he stated that he misunderstood the difference between being charged and \nbeing convicted. \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that when he was talking to investigators, he was \ntalking about \u201cthe situation\u201d and not about whether it was a felony. He denied that he was \nhiding anything, and he insisted that he was confused about the difference between being \n\u201ccharged\u201d and \u201cconvicted.\u201d (Tr. 31.)  \nTwo former supervisors submitted statements on Applicant\u2019s behalf. One former \nsupervisor has known Applicant personally and professionally for 15 years. He describes \nApplicant as a natural leader and a reliable, trustworthy, and dependable worker.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines.

An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish \nthe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \nAG \u00b6 31(d): violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to \ncomplete a court-mandated rehabilitation program. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nNeither mitigating condition is established. The incident with the 15-year-old girl \nwas more than 14 years ago, and there has been no recurrence of similar conduct. The \nlast alcohol-related criminal conduct was more than two years ago. Applicant has \nacknowledged that he has an alcohol problem. He sought and received counseling, \nattended AA meetings, and has abstained from alcohol since July 2020. However, he has \nrepeatedly concealed the fact that he was charged with a felony in May 2008, and he has \noffered conflicting and unconvincing explanations for his lack of candor. A deliberately \nfalse answer on a security clearance application is a felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 and \nis a serious crime within the meaning of Guideline J. Although the SOR does not \nspecifically allege that Applicant violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, his repeated falsifications may \nbe considered to determine whether he has been rehabilitated. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). \nAn act of falsification has security significance independent of the underlying \nconduct. See ISCR Case No. 01-19278 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Apr. 22, 2003). The mitigation of \nthe underlying conduct has little bearing on the security significance of the falsification, \nparticularly where there are multiple falsifications. ISCR Case No. 08-11944 at 3 (App. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBd.

His failure to \naccept responsibility for his conduct detracts from a finding of rehabilitation. See ISCR \nCase No. 96-0360 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 1997). \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21:\u201d Excessive alcohol\nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol use or \nwhether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nAG \u00b6 22(b): alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the welfare \nand safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \nAG \u00b6 22(g): failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \nAG \u00b6 23(a) is established. Applicant\u2019s last alcohol-related incident was more than \ntwo years ago. Applicant has acknowledged that he has an alcohol problem.

Applicant has acknowledged his maladaptive \nalcohol use, participated in AA, sought and received counseling, and abstained from \nalcohol from more than two years. However, his abstinence was not \u201cin accordance with \ntreatment recommendations,\u201d because there is no evidence that he has received \ntreatment for his alcohol consumption. His ASAP attendance was not \u201ctreatment\u201d within \nthe meaning of this mitigating condition. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nThe evidence submitted at the hearing establishes the following disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \nAG \u00b616(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nBoth disqualifying conditions are established. Applicant went through the \nadjudication process three times, and each time he repeatedly and intentionally failed to \ndisclose that he was charged with a felony in May 2008, and he provided conflicting \nexplanations when confronted with this omission by investigators. In May 2009, he told \nan investigator that he did not disclose the carnal knowledge charge because he was told \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nby an unknown person that his record would be cleared if he completed his community \nservice. In June 2018, he told an investigator that he did not understand that the question \nasked if he had \u2018\u201dever\u201d been charged with a felony, as opposed to being charged during \na specific timeframe. In his answer to the SOR, he asserted that he misunderstood the \ndifference between being \u201ccharged\u201d and \u201cconvicted.\u201d At the hearing, he testified that when \nhe was being interviewed by investigators, he talked about \u201cthe situation\u201d and not whether \nthe situation was a felony. By the time he submitted his most recent SCA, he had been \nquestioned at least twice about his answer in the SCA and knew it was a concern. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant made no effort to correct the omission, \neven after being confronted with the evidence. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s repeated falsifications were not \u201cminor.\u201d \nFalsification of a security clearance application is a serious crime and \u201cstrikes at the heart \nof the security clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J, G, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered that \nApplicant was worked for a defense contractor since June 2008, held a security clearance \nsince July 2009, and is highly regarded by two former supervisors. I have considered that \nhe has acknowledged his problems with alcohol and appears to be on the path to sobriety. \nHowever, the evidence is insufficient to mitigate his criminal conduct and repeated lack \nof candor during the security-clearance process. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guidelines J, G, and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his alcohol consumption, but he has not mitigated his criminal conduct and his \nlack of candor in three consecutive security investigations. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Based on my review of the documentary \nevidence, I find that Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nFindings of Fact \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1k \nwith explanations. (Item 2) He denied \u00b6 1.a because he claimed it was resolved. He is \n58 years old, and is divorced with two adult children. From 1995 through 1997, \nApplicant attended college, but he did not obtain a degree. Since March 2008, he has \nbeen employed with his current employer, a federal contractor. \nApplicant has not \nserved in the military. He has held a security clearance since about October 2008. He \ncompleted a security clearance application on August 14, 2020. \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has 11 delinquent debts, which include a tax \ndebt to the Federal Government in the amount of $6,400.00 for tax year 2019. The total \namount of delinquent debt, including the tax debt is about $50,000. (Item 2) The \nallegations are supported by his admissions and credit reports. (Items 5, 6, and 9) (An \nalert was reported on February 3, 2022, that an unreported information about Applicant \nand his finances was reported to the CAF.)  (Item 4) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that his life was severely impacted by \na sudden and unexpected separation, and ultimately the divorce, from his wife of 27 \nyears. The separation was three years long and the divorce was final in July 1, 2021. \nHe stated that he is now retaining a bankruptcy attorney to help him reorganize and \nrepay his debts under a chapter 13 bankruptcy. He claimed in his answer to the SOR, \nthat he repaid the IRS for the amount owed and is in good standing with the IRS. He \nprovided no proof of this claim. He stated that he is now in \u201crebuilding\u201d mode, and his \nwork life is paramount to him. (Items 2, 5, and 9) \nDuring his January 2021 interview, Applicant stated he separated from his \nspouse in March 2017. He was taken by surprise and his wife took $7,000 from their \nsavings account. Because his spouse handled all the finances, Applicant assumed all \npayments were current on his accounts. (Item 7) \nIn his personal subject interview, Applicant stated that he filed his Federal tax \nreturn on July 15, 2020 for tax year 2019, but he had not paid his tax debt at that time. \nApplicant has not yet set up a payment plan with the IRS. He has now adjusted his \nwithholdings. He verified that all the accounts listed on the SOR 1.b through 1.k were \naccurate. (Item 7) He wants to discuss the matter with a bankruptcy attorney. \nAs to SOR \u00b6\u00b61.b through 1.k, the accounts are either in collection or charged off. \nThey include medical services and consumer accounts.

He \nused his credit cards to pay some bills since 2017.  His checking account is \u201cnearly\nempty every two weeks.\u201d (Item 7) Applicant stated that he is living payday-to-payday\nbecause he lost his wife\u2019s income and his salary has been cut. He stated that he intends \nto pay his bills. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal financial worksheet noted a monthly net income of $3,842, \nwith expenses of $2,437. His total monthly debt payments are $1,123 for a home \nmortgage, showing a net remainder of $282. (Item 8) He has real estate valued at \n$150,000; stock, bonds and IRA accounts at $120,000. A car valued at $15,000 and an \nannuity of $109,738. He expects that his spouse will get half of the home sale and \nannuity. He admits using poor judgment in the wake of his separation and divorce. At \nthis time, he does not have the money to file for bankruptcy, but he hopes to borrow the \nmoney from his sister. (Item 7) \nApplicant did not provide any documentation for the record to demonstrate that \nhe is taking steps to resolve his delinquent debts. He intends to pay his debts, but \npromises to pay in the future and possibly use bankruptcy to resolve his debts. \nHowever, he has not shown any mitigation for the delinquent accounts, nor has he \nproduced evidence that the tax debt is paid. He is earning a salary, but has not made \neven a small payment on any of the accounts. He claimed that the IRS debt is resolved, \nbut provided no proof. Absent any proof of payments, Applicant did not meet his burden \nof proof. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish disqualifying \nconditions under the guidelines: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), 19(c) \u201ca history \nof not meeting financial obligations, and (19f) \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently file annual \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFederal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax as required.\u201d \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted that he is responsible for the delinquent debts listed in the \nSOR, with the exception of the tax debt. He provided no documentary evidence \nsupporting his claim. With respect to the remaining delinquent debts, he listed no plan to \nsettle or make voluntary payments. His statement is \u201cvague\u201d in that he stated he is \n\u201cretaining a bankruptcy attorney\u201d. This is not sufficient to shed positive light on his \nfinancial state. He does not appear to have made any payments on any of the SOR \nallegations. He has not shown any evidence of financial responsibility, or a meaningful \ntrack record of repayments. He did have circumstances beyond his control:, separation, \ndivorce and some loss of income, but he did not act responsibly. He has not sought \nfinancial counseling beyond contemplating bankruptcy. Based on the lack of evidence, \nit is difficult to conclude that he has the requisite judgement, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness needed to have access to classified information. He has not met his \nburden and none of the mitigating conditions apply. Any doubts must be resolved in \nfavor of the Government. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Applicant suffered a separation and divorce that \nchanged his entire life and left him with one income. He has been working consistently, \nbut it is doubtful that he will be able to meet his future financial obligations. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. He has not met his burden of proof. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u20131k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Continued eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 20, 2020, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On April 13, 2022, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DCSA adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nOn an unspecified date, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on May 31, 2022, and he was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.

After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, \nand upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

He was married in 2007, \nand in March 2021, he was in the process of separating. He has one biological child and \ntwo step-children.  \nFinancial Considerations  \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 1 (Answer to the SOR, undated); Item 2 (SF \n86, dated August 20, 2020); Item 3 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated October 6, 2020, \nwith follow-on interviews); Item 4 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nReport, dated September 29, 2020); Item 5 (Documents submitted by Applicant on \nOctober 12, 2020); and Item 6 (Verato Credit Report, dated March 31, 2021). \nIn his SF 86, Applicant acknowledged having some delinquent accounts. In \nexplaining the circumstances regarding several of the accounts, he indicated that his wife \nhad lost her job and he was deployed at the time the issues arose. (Item 3 at 50-54) An \ninvestigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) subsequently \ninterviewed him on several occasions during 2020 and 2021, and during those interviews \nApplicant disclosed and described multiple financial delinquencies in his name. He \nexplained that several of the accounts became delinquent simply because he lacked \nmoney to make payments; he denied having received notices for other accounts; and he \ndisputed several accounts. He stated that his financial issues were not likely to happen \nagain because of his current better understanding of money and credit, and his planning \non obtaining a new job and making more money. He claimed to be current on all other \naccounts. He said that he was making arrangements with all of his delinquent account \ncreditors to satisfy the debts in full once he obtained his new job. (Item 3 at 8-10, 15) \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant added that some of the financial issues arose \nwhen he was a young Marine before he knew how credit worked. He also noted that some \nof his delinquent accounts were charged off and others were so old that they simply \ndropped off his credit report. He has made it a point to improve his credit rating and to \nkeep his accounts in good standing. (Item 1) \nThe SOR alleged nine still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $41,769, as \nset forth below: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to an automobile-loan account with an unpaid balance of \n$19,541 that was placed for collection and charged off after the vehicle was reportedly \nvoluntarily repossessed in June 2018. (Item 2 at 50; Item 3 at 8, 10; Item 4 at 7; Item 6 at \n2) In October 2020, the creditor confirmed the proposed estimated payoff, and Applicant \nsubsequently claimed that there was an agreed payoff amount of $10,000 less than what \nwas owed. (Item 5 at 1) There is no documentation to support Applicant\u2019s contention of \nan agreed settlement for the lesser amount. He claimed that he would start making \npayments. There is no evidence that Applicant took any action to resolve the account. \nThe account has not been resolved.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. refers to an apartment lease account with an unpaid balance of $7,272 \nthat was placed for collection. (Item 3 at 10; Item 4 at 7; Item 6 at 2) Applicant \nacknowledged that he was delinquent on his monthly rent, and that he was deployed \nwhen his wife moved out of the apartment. He claimed to have caught up with the rent, \nbut new management had no records of the payments. In October 2020, he wrote the \ncreditor requesting records and a visit to discuss how the creditor would have allowed his \nfamily to remain in the apartment if his rent was seven months delinquent. (Item 1; Item \n5 at 1-2) There is no subsequent evidence that Applicant took any action to resolve the \naccount. The account has not been resolved. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. refers to a medical account with an unpaid balance of $1,073 that was \nplaced for collection. (Item 3 at 9; Item 4 at 8; Item 6 at 2) Applicant believes the charges \nwere generated when he had a heart attack, but that the U.S. Department of Veterans \nAffairs has refused to cover the expenses. There is no evidence that Applicant took any \naction to resolve the account. The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. refers to a cellular telephone account with an unpaid balance of $1,007 \nthat was placed for collection. (Item 2 at 53-54; Item 3 at 8-9; Item 4 at 9; Item 6 at 3) \nApplicant claimed that the creditor changed his plan without his consent, and when he \ntried to correct the plan, the creditor refused to do so. Although he claimed to have \ndisputed the unpaid balance, he offered no verifying documentation to support any such \nefforts. There is no evidence that Applicant took any action to resolve the account. The \naccount has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. refers to a medical account with an unpaid balance of $810 that was \nplaced for collection. (Item 2 at 52-53; Item 3 at 8; Item 4 at 9; Item 6 at 3) Applicant was \nnot sure about the circumstances of the charges, but believes they were either a dental \nvisit for his son that was not covered by insurance or a visit to an emergency room. (Item \n1) Although he also said that it was for a doctor\u2019s visit for his son, he claimed that he had \npaid it off, but he offered no documentary evidence to verify that payments had been \nmade. The account has not been resolved.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. refers to a medical account with an unpaid balance of $511 that was \nplaced for collection. (Item 6 at 3) Applicant said that he \u201cwas sure\u201d he paid it off, and that \nthe account was no longer on his credit report. (Item 1) He offered no documentary \nevidence to verify that he had made any efforts to resolve the account. The account has \nnot been resolved.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. refers to a credit union automobile-loan account with an unpaid balance \nof $5,463 that was placed for collection and charged off. (Item 3 at 10; Item 4 at 8) \nApplicant confused this account with another one with the same creditor. He \nacknowledged that he opened the account when he was a young Marine. The car \npurportedly broke down, and he claimed that an unidentified financial advisor with the \ncreditor told him not to make any payments. He said that the account should not be on \nhis credit report because it is over seven years old. (Item 5 at 1) There is no evidence \nthat Applicant took any action to resolve the account. The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h. refers to a credit union credit-card account with an unpaid balance of \n$4,663 that was placed for collection and charged off. (Item 3 at 9; Item 4 at 8) Applicant \nconfused this account with the automobile loan with the same creditor. He acknowledged \nthat he opened the account when he was a young Marine. He claimed that an unidentified \nfinancial advisor with the creditor told him not to make any payments. He said that the \naccount should not be on his credit report because it is over seven years old. (Item 5 at \n1) There is no evidence that Applicant took any action to resolve the account.

The account has not been \nresolved. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or anything to describe with \nany specificity Applicant\u2019s current financial situation. He did not report his net monthly \nincome, his monthly household expenses, or any monthly debt payments (for even the \nmost insignificant of his delinquent debts such as the $511 medical bill). In the absence \nof such information, I am unable to determine if he has any monthly remainder available \nfor savings or spending. There is a paucity of evidence to indicate that his financial \nproblems are now under control, and it is difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in \na better position financially than he had been. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR alleged nine still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $41,769. \nApplicant\u2019s history of still-delinquent debts appears to present either an inability to satisfy \ndebts, or a history of not meeting financial obligations. His declared willingness to satisfy \nmost of those debts is unambiguous. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established, but \nthere is no evidence to support the establishment of AG \u00b6 19(b). \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. As noted \nabove, his current and continuing financial situation can be attributed to several factors: \nhis youth and inexperience with credit, perhaps called financial naivety; unspecified health \nissues, including a heart attack; his wife\u2019s loss of her job; his deployment; several periods \nof unemployment (May 2020 \u2013 July 2020; August 2014 \u2013 January 2015; and August 2013 \n\u2013 October 2013); and his separation from his wife. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Applicant was aware of most of his debts when he \nsubmitted his SF 86 in August 2020. Between the date he was interviewed by the OPM \ninvestigator in October 2020, and the date his response to the FORM was expected in \nAugust 2022, he made no claimed or verifiable efforts to address ---\nany of the delinquent \ndebts, even though he started working with his new employer in October 2020. Instead, \nhe referred to debts that should have been off his credit report because of their age.  \nBased on the evidence, it is clear that Applicant ignored his delinquent accounts \nfor a substantial multi-year period, either because of insufficient funds at time, or because \nof his financial naivety. Because of his failure to confirm payment of even his smallest \ndelinquent account (the medical bill for $511), the overwhelming evidence leads to the \nconclusion that his financial problems are not under control. He has not acted responsibly \nby failing to address his delinquent accounts and by failing to make limited, if any, efforts \nof working with his creditors. The Appeal Board has previously commented on such a \nsituation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant clearly stated that \nsuch efforts were anticipated, but he took no verified efforts to do so even after he \nobtained employment. Instead, he seems to look forward to having stale debts removed \nfrom his credit report rather than resolving them. \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports indicate that several of his debts are in charged-off \nstatus. Eventually the charged-off debts will be dropped from his credit report. \u201c[T]hat \nsome debts have dropped off his credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt \nresolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. \n14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal \nof most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first date of \ndelinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of \nlimitations, whichever is longer (Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission \nwebsite, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act Updates at Section 605, \nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

Applicant\u2019s inaction under the circumstances casts doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at \n3-4 (App. Bd.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations.\nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nhelp desk technician for a government contractor since October 2020. He was previously \nemployed by other employers as a network infrastructure technician, desktop support \nengineer, part-time truck unloader, laborer, construction equipment operator, and county \ncorrectional officer. A 1992 high school graduate, he attended both a college and a \ntechnical school and received a technical certification, but no degree. He enlisted in the \nU.S. Marine Corps in November 1996, and served on active duty until he was honorably \ndischarged in August 2004. He enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve in September 2007, \nand served in the active reserve or on active duty until he was honorably retired as a \nsergeant (E-5) in September 2018. During his military service, he was stationed in South \nKorea, Kuwait, and Afghanistan. He was granted a secret clearance in 2016.  \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant has nine still-delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $41,769. He did have some issues that may have had a negative impact \non his finances, but over time, those issues should have been overcome. In October 2020, \nhe indicated to the OPM investigator that he intended to pay off his delinquent debts as \nsoon as he started being paid from his new job. Instead, he referred to debts that should \nhave been off his credit report because they were charged off or because of their age. \nDuring the two years since his employment, he failed to resolve his delinquent debts. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of zero claimed or verifiable efforts to resolve his \ndelinquent debts and the lengthy period of non-contact with his creditors is negative and \ndisappointing. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges personal conduct, alcohol consumption, drug involvement, and criminal conduct. Applicant admitted the allegations in the original SOR. He provided brief explanations in his answer that the treatment programs, his communication with his family, and his recent marriage, have turned his life around. (November 2021 answer to SOR) His failure to respond to the new allegations set forth in subparagraphs 3.b (Personal Conduct) and 4.a and 4.b (Drug Involvement) is considered a denial of those three additional allegations. 2 Applicant is 38 years old and recently married. As of November 2021, the date of his answer to the SOR, he was living with his parents at the same address he listed in January 2018.

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nStatement of Case \nApplicant signed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e\u00ad\nQIP, Item 3) on January 9, 2020. He provided subject interviews (PSI, Item 5) to an \ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in 2016 and 2020. Item 4 \nalso contains 2019 treatment records, signed by Applicant in August 2021. On September \n28, 2021 , the Department of Defense (DOD), Defense Counterintelligence Security \nAgency (DCSA), issued an SOR detailing security concerns under the guidelines for \nalcohol consumption, criminal conduct, and personal conduct. This case is adjudicated in \naccordance with Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \n1 \n\n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) dated June 8, 2017. \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR is dated November 15, 2021. The Government \nsent a copy of its File of Relevant Material (FORM, dated March 15, 2022), the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence in support of the allegations in the SOR, to Applicant on March \n28, 2022. He received the FORM on April 11, 2022. At page 6 of the FORM, in bold letters, \nDepartment Counsel recommended Applicant file objections, submit additional \ninformation or provide explanations within 30 days of receiving the FORM. Applicant\u2019s \nresponse was due on May 11, 2022. DOHA received no response. I was assigned the \ncase on August 4, 2022. \nRulings on Procedure \nAttached to the March 15, 2022 FORM is Department Counsel\u2019s Motion to \nAmend the SOR, which seeks to add the following allegations to the SOR: \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E): \n b.

That information as set forth in subparagraphs 2.b and 2.c, above. \nb. The incident detailed in subparagraph 2.b, above occurred while you were \ngranted access to classified information. \nDepartment Counsel recommended that Applicant furnish his updated answers \nto the additional allegations with his response to the FORM. Applicant provided no \nresponse to the FORM and no answers to the additional allegations. I interpret Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to answer the additional allegations as a denial of those allegations. The motion to \namend the SOR by adding subparagraph 3.b (Guideline E), paragraph 4, and \nsubparagraphs 4.a and 4.b, is granted. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges personal conduct, alcohol consumption, drug involvement, and \ncriminal conduct. Applicant admitted the allegations in the original SOR. He provided brief \nexplanations in his answer that the treatment programs, his communication with his \nfamily, and his recent marriage, have turned his life around. (November 2021 answer to \nSOR) His failure to respond to the new allegations set forth in subparagraphs 3.b \n(Personal Conduct) and 4.a and 4.b (Drug Involvement) is considered a denial of those \nthree additional allegations. \n2 \n\n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is 38 years old and recently married.

(Item 3 at 13) \nApplicant\u2019s January 2020 e-QIP indicates that from October 2017 to his current \nemployment in August 2021 (Item 4 at 1, 25), he was a development lead with a defense \ncontractor. From March 2016 to October 2017, he was a software analyst. From May \n2003 to March 2016, Applicant was a deputy program manager. He received his security \nclearance in October 2016. He seeks a continuation of his security clearance. (Item 3 at \n14-16, 41-43) \nDrug Involvement, Criminal Conduct \nApplicant began using marijuana in 2000. He used the drug one or two times a \nyear until he was charged with possession of cannabis and possession of drug \nparaphernalia in July 2010. (SOR 2.c) (Item 4 at 18) The arresting officer discovered a \ncontainer with marijuana and a glass pipe inside the car Applicant was driving. He was \nreferred for pre-trial diversion, but did not start the program because he was arrested for \ndriving while under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in September 2010. (SOR 1.c) He pled \nno contest to the July 2010 drug charges; the charges were dismissed and adjudication \nwas withheld. (Item 9 at 1-5) \nIn his March 2016 e-QIP, Applicant indicated that he began using marijuana in \n2010 (Item 12 at 32), and not in 2000 as he had stated in his August 2016 PSI (item 4 at \n18). He was then granted a security clearance in October 2016. (Item 3 at 12) \nIn March 2017, Applicant was charged with possession of drug paraphernalia. \nThe charging officer found a marijuana grinder, a glass pipe, and marijuana residue in \nApplicant\u2019s vehicle. He denied that any of the items belonged to him, but he admitted he \nhad previously had marijuana in the car. Though he disclosed his March 2017 arrest in \nhis January 2020 e-QIP, he answered \u201cno\u201d to illegal use or involvement with a drug while \npossessing a security clearance. (SOR 4.b) See Item 3 at 38-39, 41. \nAlcohol Consumption, Criminal Conduct \nWhen Applicant was arrested in September 2010 for his first driving while under \nthe influence of alcohol (DUI, SOR 1.c), his blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was .17 \nand .199. His frequency of consumption during the period was one or two beers every \ntwo months. (Item 4 at 19) Applicant\u2019s sentence for the DUI included a fine, court-ordered \nalcohol counseling, and a year of probation until August 2012. (Item 3 at 38) He completed \nall conditions of the sentence.

(SOR 1.b) In \nSeptember 2019, he was found guilty of the offense and his license was suspended. He \nwas placed on probation for six months and he was required to attend alcohol counseling \nbecause of a previous DUI conviction. Applicant received an early discharge from \nprobation in March 2020. (Item 4 at 5, 10-11; Item 6 at 8) \nApplicant claimed in his August 2020 PSI that he began drinking alcohol in 2015 \nwhen he was 21 years of age. Because the first DUI occurred in September 2010 (SOR \n1.c), his claim is not credible. He could not recall his drinking frequency because he had \nbarely had any alcohol in the last 20 years. He did not intend to drink while driving and he \nwas not drinking in August 2020, the time his PSI was taken. (Item 4 at 6) \nIn his August 2016 PSI, Applicant described his alcohol use as once every two \nmonths at social gatherings. He surmised that he became intoxicated at three beers and \nnever drank to intoxication. He did not consider that he had a problem with alcohol. (Item \n4 at 19) Applicant indicated by his signature that both the August 2020 and August 2016 \nPSIs were accurate summaries of information discussed. (Item 4 at 14, 22) \nDuring a court-ordered treatment program at an addiction counseling service \nfrom October to December 2019 (Item 4 at 10-11), Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder (mild). He informed the intake officer about the circumstances leading to his \narrest in July 2019 for DUI. He claimed that he had not used alcohol in the period between \nhis first DUI in September 2010 and second DUI in July 2019. He also claimed that he \nhad not used alcohol since his July 2019 DUI. He also maintained that he had used no \nother drugs. (Item 4 at 10-11) \nThroughout the security clearance investigations in 2016, 2020, and during his \nmedical counseling in October to December 2021, Applicant supplied inconsistent \ninformation about his drug and alcohol history since 2000. These discrepancies generate \ndamage to the credibility of his current claims concerning his drug and alcohol usage. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nAnalysis\nAlcohol Consumption  \nThe security concerns of the guideline for alcohol consumption are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional of alcohol abuse or \nalcohol dependence. \nApplicant stated he did not begin to drink alcohol until he was 21 (2015), and that \nhe barely consumed any alcohol in 20 years. If he started drinking at the age of 21 (2015), \nthat would be five years after his September 2010 DUI offense. If he had had hardly \nconsumed any alcohol for about 20 years, then his BAC test results should not have been \nelevated to a level indicating he was under the influence of alcohol in the September 2010 \nDUI. \nThe medical records (October to November 2019) contain an intake diagnosis of \nalcohol use disorder (mild), which was rendered during Applicant\u2019s court-ordered \ntreatment at the addictive services treatment program. The records establish AG \u00b6 22(d). \nApplicant made some puzzling statements about his alcohol use during the medical \nevaluation. He claimed that he only consumed alcohol in September 2010 and July 2019. \nHe asserted that he has consumed no alcohol since July 2019. It is surprisingly \ncoincidental that in both instances when he chose to drink, he committed the DUI \n5 \n\n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noffenses. Furthermore, his claims are inconsistent with his claim that he was drinking \nalcohol once every two months during the August 2016 period when his PSI was taken. \nAG \u00b6 23 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s most recent alcohol-related offense occurred almost two years \nago, the inconsistencies in his accounts of his alcohol use over the years generates \ncontinuing security concerns about his trustworthiness and judgement. AG \u00b6 25(a) does \nnot apply. \nApplicant contended in his answer to the SOR that the treatment programs, his \nimproved communication, and his recent marriage, helped turn his life around. What is \nmissing from his case in mitigation is independent evidence that reinforces his contentions \nabout the changes in his life. Applicant only receives limited mitigation under AG \u00b623(b). \nAG \u00b6 23(d) applies only in part. Though the record shows that Applicant \ncompleted court-ordered counseling, education, and treatment, he has not presented a \nclear pattern of modified consumption or abstinence. This conclusion results from the \nconflicting accounts of his alcohol use he provided over the years. \nDrug Involvement \nThe security concern under the Drug Involvement/Substance Abuse Guideline is \nset forth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \n6 \n\n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe SOR and amended SOR cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption and \ncriminal conduct under drug involvement (Guideline H). \nAG \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia;  \n(e) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by \na duly qualified medical professional; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding sensitive position. \nApplicant began using marijuana in 2000. He used the drug one or two times a \nyear until he was charged with possession of cannabis and possession of drug \nparaphernalia in July 2010. (SOR 2.c) (Item 4 at 18) After his discovery of the marijuana \nin a container and a glass pipe inside the car Applicant was driving, Applicant was \narrested. He was referred for pre-trial diversion, but did not start the program because he \nwas arrested for the DUI in September 2010. He pled no contest to the July 2010 drug \ncharges; the charges were dismissed and adjudication was withheld. \nIn his March 2016 e-QIP, Applicant indicated that he began using marijuana in \n2010 (Item 12 at 32), and not in 2000 as he had stated in his August 2016 PSI (item 4 at \n18). He was then granted a security clearance in October 2016. (Item 3 at 12) \nIn March 2017, Applicant was charged with possession of drug paraphernalia. \nThe charging officer found a marijuana grinder, a glass pipe, and marijuana residue in his \nvehicle. He denied that any of the items belonged to him, but he admitted he had \npreviously had marijuana in the car. Though he disclosed his March 2017 arrest in his \nJanuary 2020 e-QIP, he answered \u201cno\u201d to illegal use or involvement with a drug while \n7 \n\n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \npossessing a security clearance. The discovery of marijuana and the drug paraphernalia \nin the vehicle Applicant was driving in 2010 and 2017, establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(c). \nThe discovery of the marijuana and drug paraphernalia in Applicant\u2019s car in March 2017, \nalong with the fact that he was granted a security clearance in October 2016, establishes \nAG \u00b6 25(f). \nAG \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s most recent drug-related offense occurred more than four years \nago, he still denies that the drug paraphernalia and the marijuana residue belonged to \nhim. In addition, Applicant\u2019s inconsistent statements about his marijuana use undermines \nthe credibility of those statements and generates continuing security concerns about his \ntrustworthiness and judgement. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) has not been fully established. Though Applicant appears to have \ntaken steps to terminate his marijuana use, he presented no documented evidence of \nsevering his ties with drug users. Although he has made productive changes by \ncommunicating his problems to his family, the record does not contain independent \nevidence demonstrating what he has done to enhance the communication any action \ntaken to avoid the environment where drugs are used. Lastly, Applicant did not provide a \nsigned statement acknowledging that future drug use could be grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nCriminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set forth in AG \u00b6 30: \n8 \n\n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nThe potential disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31 are: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, anyone of which on its own would be unlikely \nto affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was charged, prosecuted or convicted.  \nApplicant\u2019s commission of two DUI offenses and two drug offenses cast doubt on \nhis reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists the pertinent mitigating conditions that may be applicable in this \ncase: \n(a) so much time has passed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community development. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) has not been established. Though Applicant\u2019s most recent DUI \noffense occurred almost two years ago, the drug offenses occurred more than four years \nago, he continues to deny he used the marijuana in March 2017, while he possessed a \nsecurity clearance. He has been less than candid about his alcohol use over the years. \nThe record contains evidence that Applicant complied with all terms of his \nsentences and court-ordered treatment and counseling. But the most persuasive \nevidence of reform and rehabilitation is acceptance of the past adverse conduct and \ndocumented efforts to prevent a recurrence in the future. Mitigating evidence under AG \u00b6 \n32(d) is limited. \n9 \n\n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set forth in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. The following will normally result in an unfavorable \nnational security eligibility determination, security clearance action, or \ncancellation or further processing for national security eligibility.  \nThe potential disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 are: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment \nof questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that he may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation;  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or government protected information \u2026 \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \n10 \n\n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nGuideline E addresses conduct of a questionable nature, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to obey rules and regulations which raise questions about an individual\u2019s \njudgment and ability to protect classified information. Applicant alcohol and drug use, \nwhich has independent significance under the criminal conduct guideline, establishes the \ndisqualifying conditions posted in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d). \nThe potential mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur.  \nAs with the conclusions reached in AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), 26(a), and 32(a), AG \u00b6 17 (c) \nhas not been established. Though the most recent alcohol-related offense occurred in \n2019, and the most recent drug offense was in 2017, I am unable to justify with complete \nconfidence that the conduct will not recur. Had Applicant been truthful about his alcohol \nconsumption and accepted responsibility for using marijuana while holding a security \nclearance, his adverse conduct may have been mitigated by the passage of time. \nAG \u00b6 17(d) applies on a limited basis to Applicant\u2019s acknowledgement of the \nalcohol-related incidents and completion of court-ordered treatment and counseling, but \nthere is no evidence of voluntarily seeking support to prevent a recurrence of the past \nalcohol-related conduct. He receives no mitigation for not providing the full story about his \nalcohol use. He has not accepted responsibility for his marijuana use while holding a \nsecurity clearance and having a sensitive position. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for financial considerations in \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n11 \n\n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have carefully evaluated the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the \nspecific guidelines in the context of the entire record. Applicant is 38 years old and \nmarried. He has received three academic degrees in 2007, 2012, and 2015. He was a \ndeputy program manager from 2003 to 2016. Between 2016 and employment with his \ncurrent employer, he has been a software analyst and a development lead. \nOn the other hand, Applicant has not been totally honest about his alcohol and \ndrug use during the security investigation. Based on the drug paraphernalia discovered \nin the search of Applicant\u2019s vehicle resulting in the drug charges in March 2017, including \nApplicant\u2019s admission to the charging officer, and the fact that he had a security clearance \ngranted to him in October 2016, it is reasonable to infer that he was using the drug in \nMarch 2017 while possessing a security clearance. Following a careful examination of the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under alcohol consumption, criminal conduct, \npersonal conduct, and drug involvement, I conclude that Applicant has failed to sufficiently \nmitigate the remaining security concerns arising from the guidelines for alcohol \nconsumption, drug involvement, criminal conduct, and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a, 3.b:   \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n12 \n\n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n__________ \nSubparagraphs 4.a, 4.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant access \nto classified information or a sensitive position.

He \nfailed to provide sufficient documentation showing that he filed his state tax returns for \nthese years. (Tr. 53-55, 58, 70; GE 3, 10) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j is a delinquent federal tax debt for tax year 2019 in the approximate \namount of $4,261. Applicant admitted that this debt is unpaid. He stated that he did not \nknow it was owed until the day before his hearing. (Tr. 56-57, 64-65; AE D) \nIn his post-hearing submission, Applicant provided two state tax installment bills \nshowing that he owes the state $10,045 in back taxes. The documentation shows that he \nhas an agreement to pay $451 monthly, however, he did not provide sufficient \ndocumentation showing when these installment agreements were made, or that any \npayments have been made.

In January \n2021, he hired a tax relief company to investigate the extent of his delinquent returns and \ntax debts, and claims that he provided that information to his current tax preparer. (Tr. 47-\n48, 51, 71, 80-81; AE B, I; GE 3, 8) \nApplicant stated that the cause for his financial problems was the government shut \ndown in 2013, and his wife having three children between 2012-2014. However, the \nalleged SOR debts are from a later time-period, and most of federal and state tax issues \nare more recent as well. He also asserted that as a government contractor, he has been \nlaid off almost every year or two when contracts end. However, his SCA shows that he \nhas been regularly employed since February 2006, and his only period of unemployment \nwas between September 2008 and October 2008. While he has frequently changed \nemployers, he failed to provide documentation showing that these employment changes \nnegatively impacted his finances.

He reported that he \nput $20,000 down on the vehicle, and the total cost was about $82,000.

The \nrecord also shows that he had a $4,643 lien from a utility company, which was released \nin 2021. (Tr. 37-38, 74; GE 3; AE A) \nApplicant did not provide documentation of his current finances, to include his \nmonthly income or expenses, or his savings. After receiving the SOR, Applicant spent \nabout $32,000 to pay tax and other delinquent debt. He claimed that he had this money \nin savings, but did not provide further information about why he did not utilize it prior to \nreceiving the SOR. Throughout the hearing, Applicant was evasive in answering \nquestions about his finances, and failed to provide requested documentation to \nsubstantiate his claims.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nThe SOR allegations are established by the interrogatory response, tax records, \ncredit reports, and Applicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nMost of Applicant\u2019s debts were paid in October 2021, after receiving the SOR in \nthis case. He resolved SOR \u00b6 1.b in September 2021, prior to receiving the SOR, but after \nthe clearance process began. An applicant who begins to resolve security concerns only \nafter having been placed on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the \njudgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal \ninterests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, \n2019). He did not establish a sufficient track record of debt payments, or document efforts \nthat he took to resolve his debts until recently. He did not provide sufficient documentation \nshowing that his unfiled federal and state tax returns are resolved, or that his new tax \ndebts are being paid. He did not provide sufficient documentation showing that any of the \nfinancial concerns alleged in the SOR occurred under such circumstances that it is \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur. He did not provide sufficient documentation of his current financial \nsituation or evidence which might establish his ability to address his debts responsibly. \nHis failure to timely file his federal and state tax returns, pay tax and charged-off debt is \nrecent, not isolated, and in most cases is ongoing. These financial issues continue to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply. AG \u00b6 20(d) only applies to \u00b6 1.b, because it was paid before he received the SOR. \nThere is insufficient documentation to show that Applicant\u2019s financial problems \noccurred under circumstances beyond his control, and that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. Applicant did not take significant action to resolve his debts until after \nhe received the SOR in this case. His use of savings to resolve his delinquent debts all \nat once suggests that he had the ability to do so, but did not take action until his security \nclearance application was in jeopardy. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) partially applies because Applicant submitted documentation showing \nthat he has a payment arrangement to pay new state tax debt. However, he failed to \nprovide sufficient documentation of any payments made in the installment agreement, or \nwhen it was set up. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He has new delinquent tax \ndebts, and did not establish a track record of debt payments and responsibly managing \nhis finances.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a Department of Defense contractor seeking a security clearance. She was born in another country and immigrated to the United States in 1998 at the age of 13. She became a US citizen in 2004. She attended a for-profit technical institute between 2005 to 2009, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree. She has never served in the U.S. military. She is single and has no children. (Tr. 10, 24, 32; Gov 1) The names of individuals, businesses, and institutions have been changed in this decision in the interests of protecting Applicant\u2019s privacy. Guideline F, Financial Considerations: Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e- QIP) on October 1, 2020. Under Section 26 \u2013 Financial Record of the e-QIP, she indicated that she may be delinquent on Federal student loans on her credit reports. She indicated that her Federal student loans were being reviewed for forgiveness as a result of the technical institute\u2019s false promises of future employment after graduation. She estimated the total amount of her student loans was $45,000. She listed no other delinquent debts or financial issues. (Gov 1 at 34-35) Applicant\u2019s security clearance background investigation revealed the following delinquent debts: four delinquent student loans placed for collection owed to the Department of Education in the amounts of $10,876; $8,385; $3,073; and $532; an approximate total of $22,866.

In her answer to the SOR, \nApplicant provided a letter from the Department of Education, dated July 12, 2021. I am \nmarking this two-page letter as AE O. Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, \nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nAdministrative Notice \nOn August 18, 2022, I sent the parties two press releases issued by the \nDepartment of Education regarding the ability of students and former students of the \ntechnical institute which Applicant attended to file borrower defense claims seeking a \ndischarge of their student loans. I informed the parties that I intend to take \nadministrative notice of these documents. Each party was given the opportunity to \nobject. Neither party objected. I have taken administrative notice of the following facts \nfrom the two documents which are marked as Admin Notice Documents (Admin Not) 1 \nand 2: \nOn June 16, 2021, the U.S. Department of Education announced the approval of \n18,000 borrower defense to repayment (borrower defense) claims for individuals who \nattended the technical institute which Applicant attended. These borrowers will receive \n100 percent loan discharges, resulting in approximately $500 million in relief. The \napprovals cover two categories: first, the student\u2019s likely employment prospects; and \nsecond, the student\u2019s ability to transfer credits. (Admin Not I) \nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. Department of Education announced it will \ndischarge all remaining federal student loans that borrowers received to attend the \ntechnical institute from January 1, 2005, through its closure in September 2016. The \ndecision follows the Department\u2019s findings based on extensive internal records, \ntestimony from the technical institute\u2019s managers and recruiters, and first-hand accounts \nfrom borrowers, and will result in 208,000 borrowers receiving $3.9 billion in full loan \ndischarges. \nU.S. Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona said: \nIt is time for student borrowers to stop shouldering the burden from [the \ntechnical institute\u2019s] years of lies and false promises. The evidence shows \nthat for years, [the technical institute\u2019s] leaders intentionally misled \nstudents about the quality of their programs in order to profit off federal \nstudent loan programs, with no regard for the hardship this would cause. \nThe Biden-Harris Administration will continue to stand up for borrowers \nwho have been cheated by their colleges, while working to strengthen \noversight and enforcement to protect today\u2019s students from similar \ndeception and abuse. (Admin Not 2)  \nThe U.S Department of Education concluded that the technical institute Applicant \nattended made repeated and significant misrepresentations to students related to how \nmuch they could expect to earn and the jobs they could obtain after graduation between \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2005 and the institute\u2019s closure in 2016.

(Gov 1 at 34-35) \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance background investigation revealed the following \ndelinquent debts: four delinquent student loans placed for collection owed to the \nDepartment of Education in the amounts of $10,876; $8,385; $3,073; and $532; an \napproximate total of $22,866.

Four additional student loans were also alleged in the \namounts of $10,531; $7,019; $4,823; and $3,587; an approximate total of $25,960. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h: Gov 1 at 34-35; Gov 2; Gov 3 at 5-6) \nApplicant admitted all of the debts. She took out these student loans to pay for \nthe technical institute she attended from 2005 to 2009. She chose to attend the \ntechnical institute because of their promises of future employment upon graduation. \nUpon her graduation, she could not find a well-paying job relative to her degree. During \ncollege, she worked part-time in a department store. She continued to work at the \ndepartment store after graduation until she could find a better paying position. Applicant \ntook more classes on software testing to qualify for better paying jobs. In 2013, she was \nhired as a test engineer for a commercial technical company. She worked for the \ncompany until 2015 when her current employer, a defense contractor, hired her. Both of \nthese jobs were unrelated to the field she was trained for at the technical institute.

Her payments were between $500 to $800 a month. She made \npayments for close to a year. She applied for a forbearance in 2011, because of her low \nincome from working at the department store and having to pay out-of-pocket medical \ncosts because she had no health insurance. She applied for and received an extension \nof the forbearance every six months through October 2020. In October 2020, she was \ntold that she could no longer apply for forbearance. (Tr. 34-38; Gov 2) \nIn 2019, Applicant learned that a lawsuit was filed against the technical institute \nbased on their false promises of post-graduate employment. A judgment was entered \nagainst the technical institute. Applicant was advised to apply for her loans to be \ndischarged under the borrower defense to repayment rules, 34 C.F.R \u00a7 685.206(c) or \n\u00a7685.22. She applied for a discharge on July 12, 2021. (AE O) On March 24, 2022, the \nDepartment of Education approved her claim for discharge of payment of her federal \nstudent loans. This appears to be related to student loan debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 \n1.d.  (Tr. 37; AE A)  \nAfter the discharge, she had four remaining federal subsidized student loans in \ndefault, an approximate balance of $22,954. Sometime after March 2022, Applicant \nsubmitted a request for reconsideration to request the discharge of the remaining four \nloans. She hopes to have a decision from the Department of Education by August 2022. \nShe has no other delinquent debts. If her request for reconsideration is denied, she is \nprepared to enter into a payment agreement on her remaining student loans. Her \ncurrent monthly income is $4,100. She has over $86,000 in savings and over $36,800 in \nher retirement account. She is capable of making payments towards the remaining \nstudent loans if they do not qualify for discharge. (Tr. 21, 28-30, 40; AE I; AE A; AE B; \nAE C; AE D) \nApplicant earned approximately $65,000 a year when she worked for her first \ntechnical company between 2013-2015. Her current employer hired her in 2015 at the \nstarting annual salary of $52,000. She was promoted in 2019 and currently earns \n$75,000, annually. In 2011, Applicant and her mother moved in with her sister and her \nhusband to save expenses. She does not pay rent, but she helps out with groceries and \nrunning errands. In 2015, Applicant needed a car. Her sister bought a car for her in the \namount of $16,000. Applicant paid her sister $1,000 a month until the car was paid off in \n2017. Applicant encountered health issues between 2017 to 2019. She paid \napproximately $11,084 for treatments that were not covered by insurance.

She worked a near-minimum-wage job during college and for several years after \ngraduation. She received a degree from the technical institute that defrauded her. Mr. \nG. and his wife have been advocates for Applicant over 10 years. They invited her to \nleave her apartment and move in with them in order to allow her to attain more financial \nstability and to recover from the reality that her degree was \u201cempty\u201d or \u201ccontained no \nvalue\u201d on the open market. He states Applicant is financially secure. He works with her \nto insure she is contributing to her savings account and retirement account. (Tr. 44; AE \nE)   \nMr. G. states that they have spoken with the staff of Applicant\u2019s technical institute \non numerous occasions over the years and sought legal guidance on how to deal with \nher \u201cempty\u2019 degree.\u201d When claims against the technical institute began to gain traction \nand Applicant received letters to participate in lawsuits, they determined delaying \npayments was in the Applicant\u2019s best interests, especially with the eventual guilty pleas \nof the technical institute. He states Applicant\u2019s loans are being forgiven. As a one-time \nholder of a security clearance; former contractor of a government agency; and former \nemployee with Navy, he has no doubt Applicant will continue to be a significant asset to \nthe U.S. Government. (AE E) \nApplicant\u2019s managers think highly of her. In various feedbacks during her tenure \nat her current employer, she has been described as \u201ca true team player\u201d She is \ndedicated to helping others. People on her team rely on her for advice and knowledge-\nsharing. Applicant is \u201cthe go to person\u201d on her team. She is \u201ca huge asset . . . and is a \nrock star.\u201d (AE M) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nGUIDELINE F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAt the time the SOR was issued, Applicant had eight delinquent student loans \nplaced for collection, an approximate total of $48,826. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nAn individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or careless in his obligations to protect classified information. Behaving \nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in \nother aspects of life. A person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until \nevidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to pay debts under \nagreed terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations. \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nAG \u00b6 20 includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) applies because the circumstances Applicant found herself are \nunlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness and good \njudgment. She struggled financially for a number of years. She was unable to pay her \nstudent loans after graduating from a technical institute that falsely exaggerated their \nability to find suitable jobs for their graduates. She applied for forbearances due to low \nincome for a number of years. A judgment was entered against the technical institute \nand Applicant was allowed to apply for a discharge with the Department of Education \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunder the borrower defense provision in July 2021. In March 2022, the Department of \nEducation discharged four of the loans. Soon after, Applicant applied for reconsideration \nto seek discharge under the borrower\u2019s defense provision for the remaining four loans. \nShe lives within her means and has built up savings over the years. Should the \nreconsideration request be denied, she intends to and is capable of repaying the \nremaining student loans. She has no other delinquent debt. The unusual circumstances \nof this case raise no concerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies, because Applicant was a victim of the predatory lending \npractices of the technical institute. Upon graduation from the technical institute, \nApplicant was unable to find well-paying employment despite the promised claims of \nemployment placement by the technical institute. She worked low-paying jobs for \nseveral years. She acted responsibly under the circumstances. She applied for \nforbearances of her student loans, took courses to increase her chances for better \nemployment, and did not incur excessive debt. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies. Applicant was eligible to discharge her student loans under \nthe borrower defense to repayment rules. She applied and was notified in March 2022 \nthat four of the student loans were discharged. She was entitled to submit a request for \nreconsideration on the four remaining student loans. She submitted the request for \nreconsideration and is awaiting the results. She saved money over the years and has \nover $86,000 in savings. If the reconsideration request is denied, she is willing and \ncapable of paying the remaining balance of the student loans. Under the circumstances, \nApplicant is a making a good-faith effort to resolve her delinquent student loan \naccounts. \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised under Financial Considerations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the favorable feedback \non Applicant\u2019s performance from her supervisors. I considered the statement from her \nbrother-in-law. While Applicant admitted to over $45,000 in delinquent student loans, \nshe took out the loans to attend a technical institute that was found guilty of defrauding \nstudents by promising them well-paying jobs upon their graduation. Upon her \ngraduation, she discovered it was a worthless degree. She paid for and took more \nclasses so she could qualify to work in the information technology career field. From \n2011 to October 2020, she applied for and received a student loan forbearance every \nsix months due to her low income. Upon the advice of her brother-in-law, she delayed \nmaking payments on her student loans to await the outcome of the lawsuit against the \ntechnical institute. \nIn 2021, Applicant was able to apply to the Department of Education for a \ndischarge of her federal loans under the borrower defense to repayment rules. Four of \nher eight student loans were discharged. She submitted a reconsideration to have her \nfour remaining student loans discharged. There is a good chance she will be successful. \nIf she is not successful, she is able to repay the student loan balance. She lives within \nher means. She has over $86,000 in savings. Aside from her student loans, she has no \nother delinquent debt. Her financial situation is stable. She has been open about her \nstudent loan situation since the beginning. Applicant proved that she is reliable and \ntrustworthy. Security concerns under financial considerations and personal conduct are \nmitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 30 years old, and unmarried with no children. She has a Bachelor\u2019s degree. She holds the position of Tech 1. She is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because she made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about her reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The SOR alleges that Applicant has fifteen delinquent accounts totaling in excess of $64,000, consisting mainly of student loan debt, and several other miscellaneous debts. Applicant admits all of the debts listed in the SOR. Credit reports of the Applicant dated February 25, 2021; and March 2, 2022, confirm the indebtedness. (Government Exhibits 4 and 5.) Applicant attended a University from August 2010 to May 2014. She obtained student loans totaling approximately $52,000 to attend college. Although she worked part-time while going to school, she did not earn much money, and she fell into debt, simply trying to support herself. After completing her bachelor\u2019s degree, she found employment, but did not earn enough money to support herself and make payments toward her student loans. Applicant\u2019s income tax refunds for tax years 2017 and 2018 were garnished and placed toward her student loan indebtedness. Ap",

She has a Bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. She holds the position of Tech 1. She is seeking to obtain a security clearance \nin connection with her employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because she \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about her \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has fifteen delinquent accounts totaling in excess \nof $64,000, consisting mainly of student loan debt, and several other miscellaneous \ndebts.

Applicant\u2019s income tax refunds for tax years 2017 and 2018 \nwere garnished and placed toward her student loan indebtedness. \nApplicant began working for her current employer in January 2021. \nUnderstanding that in order to be eligible for a security clearance she must show \nfinancial responsibility, Applicant has recently been working diligently to get her student \nloans in order. On March 31, 2022, Applicant applied for and was approved for an \nIncome Driven Payment Plan with the Government to pay her student loans. \nShe \nbrought her loans out of default, which required that she make a down payment of $895. \nShe had all of her student loans consolidated, and a monthly loan payment of $122 was \nscheduled to start February 2022, and continue on a monthly basis until resolved. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n       \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n    \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n      \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n  \nThe following delinquent debts set forth in the SOR are of security concern: \n1.a.

By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nIn June 2019, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving While Intoxicated, \n(DUI) 1st  offense.  Applicant\u2019s blood alcohol level at the time of the arrest was .15 -.20% \nregistering a BAC of .16.  Applicant was found guilty and sentenced to 12 months in jail \nwith 11 months, 25 days suspended, a fine, and supervised probation.   Applicant stated \nthat after her conviction, she enrolled in and successfully completed a Substance Abuse \nCounseling Program, surrendered her driver\u2019s license for one year as required, paid the \nfine, and completed the community service.

She \nexplained that she missed the cut off time to turn herself in.  Her excuse was that she \nwas working late hours at her job.  It was too difficult for her to be expected to be at the \nSheriff\u2019s Office in the early morning after working late the night before, and she missed \nit.  (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) \nIn January 2020, Applicant was charged with a probation violation for Failure to \nSurrender the Sheriff\u2019s Office and a warrant was issued for Applicant\u2019s arrest.  The \nCharge was dismissed and Applicant was ordered to serve straight time.  Applicant \nstated that she missed the cut off time to turn herself in, once again, because the \nweekends were not working for her.  As a result, the court imposed seven straight days \nin jail.  (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) \nLetters of recommendation from her Field Operations Manager, and her \nsupervisor attest to her strong work ethic, motivation, and commitment to the tasks she \nis assigned. Applicant began her employment as a temporary employee in 2020, and \nwas offered a full time position in 2021. She has grown-up on the job, and has made \ngreat strides at improving herself. She was selected out of 30 team members to attend \nspecial training courses, costing the company $10,000. Her performance at this training \nwas outstanding. They recommend her for security clearance. (Applicant\u2019s Response \nto FORM.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred excessive delinquent debt totaling in excess of $64,000, most \nof which was student loan debt for her college education. \nShe also has several \ndelinquent medical bills. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20; \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nand    \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has made significant headway toward resolving her delinquent debt. \nShe is currently making regular monthly payments to resolve her large student loan \ndebt, and is setting up payment arrangements with her creditors concerning her much \nsmaller delinquent medical debts. She has provided sufficient evidence in mitigation. \nThis shows good judgment, responsibility and reliability. Accordingly, this guideline is \nfound for the Applicant. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgement, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted \nor convicted. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Neither of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job \ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal record reflects one arrest and conviction for DUI in 2019, and \ntwo back-to-back charges, one in 2019, and the other in 2020, for violating her \nprobation by failing to surrender on the warrant issued against her. Evidently she did \nnot complete the community service requirements she was sentenced to complete in a \ntimely fashion. \nHer most recent violation occurred in 2020, just two years ago. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct demonstrates poor judgment, immaturity, and a total disregard for \nthe law. Her criminal conduct is recent and inexcusable. Based upon this criminal \nrecord, Applicant has not established that she is sufficiently reliable and trustworthy to \naccess classified information. Her behavior gives rise to serious concerns about her \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nThe before-mentioned disqualifying \nconditions have been established and are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the Financial Considerations concern, but has not mitigated the Criminal \nConduct security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.: through 1.n:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.: through 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation,\nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of\ndrug paraphernalia. \n \n \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana and LSD. Marijuana and LSD are \ncontrolled substances and illegal under federal law. The above disqualifying conditions \nare applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \nApplicant's illegal drug use and possession occurred while he was in college, \nbefore he began working for his current employer or applied for a security clearance. He \nlast used an illegal drug in July 2020 a period of abstinence of about 19 months. \nApplicant was forthright, open, and honest about his past illegal drug use, volunteering it \nin his SF 86 and during his subject interview. In his SF 86, Applicant certified that he no \nlonger intends to use illegal drugs. The veracity of this statement is bolstered by his \nopenness during the investigative process about his past, illegal drug use. His conduct \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nno longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that \nApplicant has abstained from illegal drug use for an appropriate period, and that illegal \ndrug use is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 26(a) is established. \nApplicant acknowledged in his subject interview that he probably still associates \nwith individuals who use illegal drugs. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b)(1) and 26(b)(2) are not established. \nWhile he certifies in his SF 86 that he will no longer use illegal drugs, Applicant does not \nprovide a signed statement acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) is not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on \nSeptember 23, 2021. The case was heard on October 25, 2021.

Applicant testified on his own behalf. He asked that the record remain \nopen for the receipt of additional documentation. Applicant timely submitted Applicant \nExhibits A through D, which were also admitted without objection, and the record closed \non November 2, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 26 years old and married with two children. He has a high school \neducation, and is currently attending college. Applicant is employed by a defense \ncontractor as a Machinist and is trying to obtain a security clearance in relation to his \nemployment. Applicant has not previously held a security clearance.

Applicant admitted all the \nallegations in the SOR.

(Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5, and 6.) \nApplicant stated that these debts all arose in the 2017 time-frame. He was fired \nfrom a job and found himself unable to keep up with those particular debts at that time. \n(Government Exhibit 1 at Section 26; Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 23-28.) \nThe current status of the allegations in the SOR is as follows: \n1.a. Applicant admitted having an automobile repossessed in approximately 2017. \nHe stated that he could afford the car when he bought it, but after he was fired, it was \nimpossible to keep up payments. Eventually he let the car go to repossession. After the \nautomobile was sold at auction Applicant owed $18,000.

(Government Exhibit 1 at Section 26; Applicant Exhibit B; Tr. 29-33, 36-38.) \n1.b. Applicant admitted owing a past-due credit card debt in the amount of \napproximately $3,775. This debt also arose in the 2017 time-frame. Subsequent to the \nhearing Applicant paid this creditor the full amount owed on October 26, 2021, as \nconfirmed by documentation from the creditor. This debt is resolved. (Applicant Exhibit D; \nTr. 36-38.) \n1.c. Applicant admitted owing a creditor $643 for a charged-off debt. This debt also \narose in the 2017 time-frame. Subsequent to the hearing Applicant paid this creditor the \nfull amount owed on October 26, 2021, as confirmed by documentation from the creditor. \nThis debt is resolved. (Applicant Exhibit C; Tr. 36-38.) \nApplicant stated that his current financial situation is stable. He is able to pay his \ncurrent debts and also has a rainy-day fund. He stated, \u201cI strongly believe that I have \nlearned from my mistakes and believe that allowing accounts to become neglected & \ndelinquent is a thing of the past.\u201d The credit reports in the record confirm that fact. \nApplicant also pointed to the fact that the period of delinquency was limited, and he has \nhad no past-due debts since that time. Finally, Applicant stated that his failure to resolve \nthese debts earlier \u201cwas pure immaturity and misguidance from people that are close to \nme.\u201d (Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5, and 6; Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 33-34.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to\nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant owed approximately $21,000 for two past-due debts and one automobile \nrepossession as of the date the SOR was issued. These facts establish prima facie \nsupport for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to \nmitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation is stable. He is paying everyday debts. The \ndebts in the SOR arose in 2017 after Applicant lost his job. Applicant indicated some initial \nreluctance to resolve those three debts. However, as shown, he has resolved the three \ndebts set forth in the SOR to the satisfaction of the creditors. Applicant has behaved \nresponsibly in resolving his debts. He has the knowledge and ability that will allow him to \nstay on a proper financial footing. He has fully mitigated all the financial concern \nallegations in the SOR. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his financial situation by resolving his debts in a responsible manner, \nwhich does not evince poor judgment or unreliability. He has minimized the potential for \npressure, coercion, or duress, as well as the likelihood of recurrence. Overall, the record \nevidence does not create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 45, has worked for a federal contracting company as an operations supervisor at a shipyard since March 2017. He completed a security clearance application, his first, in December 2019. He disclosed derogatory information regarding a 2010 DUI. The ensuing investigation developed further information about the DUI as well as some derogatory financial information. The SOR alleges that Applicant owes $31,043 on a delinquent medical account. The SOR also alleges that he filed for, and received relief from, $332,808 in debt through Chapter 7 bankruptcy in August 2008. The record contains very little information about the 2008 bankruptcy. Given that the bankruptcy occurred eleven years before he completed the security clearance application, Applicant was not required to disclose it and the investigator did not ask about it during Applicant\u2019s February 2020 background interview. The only available information is from the May 2008 bankruptcy application. According to the bankruptcy application, Applicant sought relief from $332,808 in debt. The largest debt, 86% of the reported debt, was for a $289,310 mortgage opened in December 2006. Applicant incurred the $31,043 medical debt after an accident in November 2013, which required him to be airlifted to a hospital. At the time of the accident, Applicant did not have insurance. According to his background interview, Applicant did not learn about the debt until 2018. He began making $100 monthly payments. He clai",

This action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position, implemented on June 8, 2017. \nDOD adjudicators were \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a decision without a hearing. \nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 1. The Government submitted its written case on June 9, \n2022. The Government provided Applicant a complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) and the Directive. He acknowledged receipt of the documents on June \n21, 2022, and did not respond. The attachments to the FORM are admitted to the \nrecord as GEs 1 through 5. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 45, has worked for a federal contracting company as an operations \nsupervisor at a shipyard since March 2017. He completed a security clearance \napplication, his first, in December 2019. He disclosed derogatory information regarding \na 2010 DUI. The ensuing investigation developed further information about the DUI as \nwell as some derogatory financial information. The SOR alleges that Applicant owes \n$31,043 on a delinquent medical account. The SOR also alleges that he filed for, and \nreceived relief from, $332,808 in debt through Chapter 7 bankruptcy in August 2008. \nThe record contains very little information about the 2008 bankruptcy. Given that \nthe bankruptcy occurred eleven years before he completed the security clearance \napplication, Applicant was not required to disclose it and the investigator did not ask \nabout it during Applicant\u2019s February 2020 background interview. The only available \ninformation is from the May 2008 bankruptcy application. According to the bankruptcy \napplication, Applicant sought relief from $332,808 in debt. The largest debt, 86% of the \nreported debt, was for a $289,310 mortgage opened in December 2006. \nApplicant incurred the $31,043 medical debt after an accident in November 2013, \nwhich required him to be airlifted to a hospital. At the time of the accident, Applicant did \nnot have insurance. According to his background interview, Applicant did not learn \nabout the debt until 2018. He began making $100 monthly payments. He claimed he \nstopped making payments when the interest and penalties on the debt exceeded the \n$100 payment. He tried to negotiate a settlement with the company to no avail. \nAside from the alleged medical debt, Applicant\u2019s January 2020 credit report \nshows a favorable credit history. Applicant obtained a mortgage loan in 2012 and the \naccount is in good standing. He has no other consumer credit accounts in his name. He \nis the authorized user on three credit cards, which are also in good standing. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nadministrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 \ndescribing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision.\n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAn individual\u2019s finances become a concern when their failure to meet their \nfinancial obligations is a possible indication of poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at a greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18) \nThe record establishes that, in 2008, Applicant benefited from bankruptcy \nprotection and that, in 2013, he incurred a medical debt that remains unpaid. Financial \nconsideration disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201can inability to satisfy debts,\u201d applies. \nThe record does not contain enough information to apply any of the other disqualifying \nconditions. \nBecause the circumstances leading up the 2008 bankruptcy are unknown, I \ncannot make a finding about Applicant\u2019s financial habits or history preceding it, \nwhether the events leading up to the bankruptcy are likely to recur, or how the events \naffect his current security worthiness. Although the bankruptcy and the medical debt \nhappened within five years of each other, they are separate incidents that do not show \na history of financial mismanagement or irresponsibility. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant incurred the medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a after an accident. \nMedical debt is unlike other types of debt, as it does not provide much information \nabout an individual\u2019s security worthiness. In Applicant\u2019s case, the debt was incurred for \nemergency medical care as opposed to frivolous or irresponsible spending or \notherwise living beyond one\u2019s means. He incurred the debt under unplanned, \nunexpected, and nondiscretionary circumstances. Applicant had no say in the \ntransportation method or treatment healthcare professionals deemed necessary to \nensure proper care. Having been uninsured at the time of the accident, he had no \nchoice but to incur debt to secure the medically necessary treatment, which resulted in \ntens of thousands of dollars in unexpected debt. Furthermore, the record establishes \nthat Applicant attempted to pay the debt, but stopped once doing so became \nfinancially unfeasible. The record merits the application of the following mitigating \nconditions: \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and,  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control. . ., and the individual acted \nresponsibility under the circumstances. \nBased on the record, I have no doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to\nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). The purpose of a security clearance adjudication is not \ndebt collection. Rather the purpose is to make \u201can examination of a sufficient period and \na careful weighing of a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative \ndetermination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(a)) There is no \nindication of current financial problem. The record has not established that Applicant \nlives above his means or is at risk for potential exploitation based on his finances. Nor \nhas the record established that he has engaged in such reckless or irresponsible \nbehavior that suggests that he has demonstrated an unwillingness or inability to follow \nthe rules related to classified information. He disclosed the required derogatory \ninformation on his security clearance application, which indicates he is likely to continue \nto do the same as a clearance holder. A fair and commonsense assessment of the \nrecord evidence as a whole supports a conclusion that the security concerns raised \nunder the financial considerations guideline are mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nBased on the record, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance.

In his answer to the SOR, he stated he \nhad filed his past-due federal and state income tax returns alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q and 1.r. \nwere \u201cup to date.\u201d However, he did not respond to the FORM. Thus, there is no \ndocumentary record evidence to establish that the returns alleged have been filed. \nThe Guideline H allegations all stem from the same set of circumstances. First, on \nNew Year\u2019s Eve 2017, Applicant ingested a marijuana gummy bear as part of a drink \nserved at a friend\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve party. (FORM Item 12 at 1.)(SOR \u00b6 2.a) Second, he \nused an Ambien pill later that evening when he was unable to sleep. The Ambien had \nbeen prescribed to his late mother, and not to him. (FORM Item 12 at 1.)(SOR \u00b6 2.b) He \nadmits both the marijuana use and the Ambien use occurred while he held a clearance. \nThird, later that night, in the early morning hours of New Year\u2019s Day 2018, he was arrested \nand charged with driving under the influence (DUI) of liquor, drugs, or a combination \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Ambien).

He was sentenced to a 180-day jail \nterm (179 days suspended), placed on 12 months of probation, ordered to attend \nsubstance abuse education, and fined $1,800. (FORM Item 3 at 30 and FORM Item 11 \nat 4.) (SOR \u00b6 2.c) He confessed to the investigator in his interview he had failed to \ncomplete the court-ordered drug treatment program. (FORM Item 12 at 2.) \nApplicant disclosed his New Year\u2019s Eve 2017 marijuana use on his SCA. He also \nlisted the friend who hosted the party where he was provided the marijuana as a \nreference. He also said stated it would be the \u201clast time using that.\u201d (FORM Item 3 at 32 \nand FORM Item 12 at 1.) \nAs noted, Applicant disclosed the Ambien use and subsequent DUI on his SCA; \ndiscussed the events in his PSI; and admitted them in his Answer to the SOR, but he \nprovided no more subsequent evidence in mitigation, since he did not respond to the \nFORM. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd.

Applicant's delinquent debts are recent, numerous \nand ongoing. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant did not provide evidence to support his \nassertions that he had resolved his debts or had established a repayment plan. The credit \nreports reflect inaction on his part. He stated in his answer to the SOR that the student \nloan debts were being satisfied by garnishment of his pay. Payment by involuntary \ngarnishment, \u201cis not the same as, or similar to, a good-faith initiation of repayment by the \ndebtor.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 09-05700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011). He has set forth no \nplan to address them in a responsible way. See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJune 7, 2021). His other debts, too, remain unresolved. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not established. Applicant has submitted no documentary evidence \nshowing that he made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file the past-due \ntax returns alleged. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe record establishes a single use of marijuana by Applicant on New Year\u2019s Eve \n2017 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). It also establishes that he misused his mother\u2019s prescription Ambien \nprescription that same evening (SOR \u00b6 2.b) and was arrested and convicted for DUI \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Ambien) later that night. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c.). \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAs noted above, the three Guideline H allegations appear to have arisen out of the \nsame set of circumstances. Applicant used marijuana at a New Year\u2019s Eve party in \nDecember 2017. When he could not sleep afterwards, he took an Ambien that had been \nprescribed to his late mother. At some point on the same night (early on New Year\u2019s Day \n2018), he was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of Ambien. All of this \noccurred when he was granted access to classified information, and held a security \nclearance, and he admitted all three of the allegations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions establish the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline, as detailed in AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(b) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe evidence shows that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c allege the same misuse of a \nprescription drug. (FORM Item 3 at 33, FORM Item 11, and FORM Item 12 at 1-2). When \nthe same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the \nduplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice). SOR \u00b6 2.b is therefore \nresolved for Applicant. I considered them as one event in my whole-person analysis.  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable as detailed in AG \u00b6 \n26: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance\nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1)\ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or\navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a\nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and\nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is\ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is partially established. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana and misuse of \nprescription drugs while holding a security clearance occurred almost five years ago \nunder circumstances not likely to recur. However, his knowing use of marijuana followed \nby a knowing misuse of prescription drugs while holding a security clearance both cast \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is partially established. Applicant declared his intent to refrain from drug \nuse in his SCA, and there is no indication of further drug use in the last five years. \nHowever, he lists as a reference on his SCA the friend who hosted the event where the \ndrug alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a was provided, and he has not submitted a statement of intent \nwith provision for automatic revocation of his clearance for any violation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole- \nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and H in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n       \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuidelines F and H, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts \nand drug involvement. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant  \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.r: \n \n                    Subparagraph 2.a and 2.c:  \n \n \n Against Applicant \n \n                     Subparagraph 2.b: \n \n \n \n For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, all of the SOR allegations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.p.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving in an unspecified position since sometime after April 2020 when he submitted his SF 86. He was previously employed by other employers in a variety of full-time and part-time positions since September 1998. He never served with the U.S. military. He initially reported not having attended any schools in the ten years before 2020, but he subsequently acknowledged that he had attended ITT Technical Institute from 2008 until 2013. He denied having received a degree or diploma during the ten years before 2020. He was granted a secret clearance in 2014. He was married in 2017. He has no children.

Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DCSA adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nOn February 26, 2022, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on July 13, 2022, and he was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received \nthe FORM on July 23, 2022. His response was due on August 22, 2022. Applicant chose \nnot to respond to the FORM, for as of September 7, 2022, no response had been \nreceived. The case was assigned to me on October 3, 2022. The record closed on August \n22, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, all of the SOR \nallegations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.p.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are \nincorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, \nand upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nin an unspecified position since sometime after April 2020 when he submitted his SF 86. \nHe was previously employed by other employers in a variety of full-time and part-time \npositions since September 1998. He never served with the U.S. military. He initially \nreported not having attended any schools in the ten years before 2020, but he \nsubsequently acknowledged that he had attended ITT Technical Institute from 2008 until \n2013. He denied having received a degree or diploma during the ten years before 2020. \nHe was granted a secret clearance in 2014. He was married in 2017. He has no children. \nFinancial Considerations  \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 8 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated February 5, 2014); Item 7 (DOD Continuous Evaluation \nProgram (CEP) Incident Report, dated February 11, 2020); Item 2 (SF 86, dated April 2, \n2020); Item 3 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated September 24, 2020); Item 5 (Verate \nCredit Report, dated March 10, 2021); Item 2 (Answer to the SOR, dated February 26, \n2022); and Equifax Credit Report, dated July 5, 2022). \nIn his SF 86, Applicant denied having any financial issues associated with \ndelinquent accounts. (Item 2 at 32-33) On September 24, 2020, he was interviewed by \nan investigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). During that \ninterview, he disclosed that he had been having difficulties completing his SF 86 and while \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhe was attempting to make corrections, he forgot to update the section with respect to his \neducational loans. He described the problems he had been having with the school he was \nattending, and he reported that the financial aid office had to locate additional funds in \norder for him to remain in school. The result was that in addition to his 12 student loans \nwith the U.S. Department of Education, he had 2 student loans from another lender. (Item \n9 at 2) \nIn addition to an allegation alleging that Applicant filed for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy \nin April 2008, which was discharged in about July 2013, the SOR alleged 15 still-\ndelinquent accounts, of which the 14 student loans totaled approximately $101,248, and \nthe remaining unpaid charge account totaled $2,167, as set forth below: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. through 1.m. refer to student loan accounts with the U.S. Department \nof Education with unpaid balances of $14,362; $12,376; $12,021; $11,454; $8,689; \n$7,372; $6,479; $5,361; $5,280; $5,171; $4,248; and $2,639 that were placed for \ncollection. (Item 5 at 2-4; Item 6 at 15-20) In 2020, Applicant made some payments in the \namount of $190.45 each to the U.S. Department of Education, by wage garnishments, all \nof which were applied to interest and fees and other charges. In 2022, he made a $50 \npayment that was applied to interest. (Payment History attached to Answer to SOR) \nFurther discussion regarding these accounts appears below. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o. and 1.p. refer to student loan accounts with another lender \u2013 PEAKS \n\u2013 \u201cfound by the school\u201d with unpaid balances of $3,295 and $2,501 that were placed for \ncollection and charged off. (Item 6 at 21) Further discussion regarding these accounts \nappears below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.n. refers to a charge account with an unpaid balance of $2,167 that was \nplaced for collection. (Item 5 at 4) On February 23, 2022, Applicant paid the creditor \n$2,167.65, and there is now a zero balance. (Receipt attached to Answer to SOR) The \naccount has been resolved.  \nITT Technical Institute (ITT Tech) \nITT Tech was considered a predatory for-profit college, and PEAKS, its holding \ncompany, would offer students tuition costs through private loans. A lawsuit was filed after \nITT Tech \u2013 the university that Applicant attended and generated extensive student loans \n\u2013 entered bankruptcy and closed its 137 campuses in 2016. After the school\u2019s closure, \nhundreds of thousands of students were still required to pay for their outstanding student \nloans. A 2018 lawsuit settlement forgave $600 million that 750,000 students owed to the \nschool. In June 2019, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) reached a \nsettlement with ITT Tech that discharged about $168 million in private student loans. In \nAugust 2019, an additional settlement was reached, including a judgment against ITT \nTech for $60 million and an injunction that prohibited ITT Tech from offering student loans \nin the future. In September 2020, the CFPB reached another settlement, requiring ITT \nTech to forgive $330 Million in outstanding student loan balances. In total, ITT Tech \nerased more than $500 million in private student loan debt. As noted by The Washington \nPost on September 15, 2020: \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nForty-eight state attorneys general and the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau have secured more than $330 million in private student-loan \nforgiveness for 35,000 former students of ITT Technical Institute. \nA judgment order entered Tuesday puts to rest a 2014 lawsuit accusing the \ndefunct for-profit chain of steering students into predatory loans. PEAKS \nTrust, a private loan program run by ITT Tech and affiliated with Deutsche \nBank entities, has agreed to forgo the collection of the outstanding \neducation debt from ITT Tech students. It will also ask credit-reporting \nagencies to delete references to those loans from the credit reports of \naffected borrowers. \nEligible borrowers will be notified by PEAKS or their loan servicer and need \nto do nothing to receive forgiveness. At least 1,100 former ITT Tech \nstudents in Maryland will receive relief, while 1,840 borrowers in Virginia will \nhave their private loans canceled. \n\u201cMaryland students were deceived when they were pressured into taking on \nthese predatory loans,\u201d Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D) said \nin a statement Tuesday. \u201cPEAKS will be required by this settlement to \nprovide debt relief to Maryland students who we allege were misled while \nthey were working hard to further their education.\u201d \nITT Tech created two in-house student-loan programs as private lenders \nretreated from the market at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. Banks \nstopped extending credit to students at for-profit colleges, because of their \nhistorically high default rates. \nITT Tech issued students \u201ctemporary credits\u201d to cover remaining tuition after \nfederal and private student loans were taken into account. Some former \nstudents said the credits were marketed as grants, while others said they \nwere told the credit would not have to be repaid until six months after \ngraduation. But when the temporary credit became due, ITT Tech allegedly \npressured students into accepting loans with double-digit interest rates from \nPEAKS. \nAccording to the complaint, students said they were pulled out of class or\nthreatened with expulsion if they refused to accept the loan terms. Many of\nthe former students lacked the means to continue their education and said\nthey felt there were no other options than to accept the loans. Eighty percent\nof the loans fell into default as students could not keep up with payments. \n \n \n \n \nEven as students began defaulting in great numbers around 2011, ITT Tech \ncontinued issuing the high-cost loans. The tactics landed the company\u2019s top \nbrass in the crosshairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The \nfederal agency settled fraud cases in 2018 against former ITT chief \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nexecutive Kevin Modany and former chief financial officer Daniel Fitzpatrick \nfor allegedly deceiving investors about high rates of late payments and \ndefaults on student loans backed by the company. \nThe SEC said executives made secret payments on delinquent accounts to \ndelay defaults instead of disclosing the tens of millions of dollars in \nimpending losses to investors. Executives assured investors in conference \ncalls that the programs were performing well, while ITT\u2019s obligations to pay \nout on soured loans began to balloon, according to that complaint. \nBefore shutting down in 2016, ITT Tech was being investigated by more \nthan a dozen state attorneys general and two federal agencies for alleged \nfraud, deceptive marketing or steering students into predatory loans. That \nlegal morass led an accrediting body to threaten to end its relationship with \nthe chain, which resulted in the Education Department curtailing ITT\u2019s \naccess to federal student aid. \nDays after closing and leaving 35,000 students and 8,000 employees in the \nlurch, the company filed for bankruptcy protection to liquidate its business. \n(washingtonpost.com/education/2020/09/15/former-students-defunct-itt-tech-receive-\n330-million-private-student-loan-forgiveness/) \nA more recent update took place on August 16, 2022: \nToday, the U.S. Department of Education . . . announced that it will \ndischarge all remaining federal student loans that borrowers received to \nattend [ITT Tech] from January 1, 2005, through its closure in September \n2016. The decision, which follows Departmental findings based on \nextensive internal records, testimony from [ITT Tech] managers and \nrecruiters, and first-hand accounts from borrowers, will result in 208,000 \nborrowers receiving $3.9 billion in full loan discharges. This includes \nborrowers who have not yet applied for a borrower defense < Caution-\nhttps://studentaid.gov/borrower-defense/ > to repayment discharge. These \nborrowers will have the federal student loans they received to attend [ITT \nTech] discharged without any additional action on their part. \n\"It is time for student borrowers to stop shouldering the burden from [ITT \nTech]'s years of lies and false promises,\" said U.S. Secretary of Education \nMiguel Cardona. \"The evidence shows that for years, [ITT Tech]'s leaders \nintentionally misled students about the quality of their programs in order to \nprofit off federal student loan programs, with no regard for the hardship this \nwould cause.  The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to stand up for \nborrowers who've been cheated by their colleges, while working to \nstrengthen oversight and enforcement to protect today's students from \nsimilar deception and abuse.\" \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \nToday's action brings the total amount of loan relief approved by the Biden-\nHarris Administration to nearly $32 billion for 1.6 million borrowers. This \nincludes $13 billion related to institutions that took advantage of borrowers. \nIt represents the Department's continued commitment to providing debt \nrelief to eligible borrowers. \nToday's [ITT Tech] announcement builds on the Administration's previous \nactions related to [ITT Tech], which has resulted in the approval of $1.9 \nbillion in discharges for 130,000 students to date. This includes borrower \ndefense findings that [ITT Tech] engaged in widespread and pervasive \nmisrepresentations related to the ability of students to get a job or transfer \ncredits, and lying about the programmatic accreditation of [ITT Tech]'s \nassociate degree in nursing. Separately, the Department announced an \nexpanded window for borrowers who attended but did not graduate from \n[ITT Tech] to receive closed school discharges. \n\"[ITT Tech] defrauded hundreds of thousands of students, as we identified \nwhen I was the director of the [CFPB],\" said Federal Student Aid Chief \nRichard Cordray. \"By delivering the loan relief students deserve, we are \ngiving them the opportunity to resume their educational journey without the \nunfair burden of student debt they are carrying from a dishonest institution.\" \nThe Department's findings around [ITT Tech] were assisted by significant \nand extensive work by attorneys general across the country, the [CFPB], \nand Veterans Education Success. The Department received important \nevidence from half the country's state offices of attorneys general, led by \nColorado and Oregon Attorneys General and supported by significant \nevidence from the Iowa and New Mexico Attorneys General. \nThe Department's findings are based on extensive evidence, including \ninternal [ITT Tech] policies and records; recruitment materials and \nbrochures; recordings of interactions between [ITT Tech]'s representatives \nand prospective students; testimony from former students, employees, and \nadministrators; investigative files and submissions from congressional \ninvestigators and state offices of attorneys general; and the tens of \nthousands of individual borrower defense applications submitted by former \n[ITT Tech] students. . . . \n\"The automatic loan cancellation announced today will provide life-changing \nrelief that has long been owed to former [ITT Tech] students,\" said Rohit \nChopra, director of the CFPB. \"Far too many Americans are still on the hook \nfor loans they acquired at colleges that profited from deceiving students, \nand the CFPB will continue to work with the Department of Education to \naddress predatory student loan debt, to protect students, and to hold \nwrongdoers accountable.\" \n(washingtonpost.com/education/2022/08/16/itt-tech-student-loan-forgiveness/) \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBased on all of the above, Applicant is no longer legally responsible for the student \nloans generated by ITT Tech and PEAKS, and it appears that all he has to do to obtain \nforgiveness for the loans is to complete and submit the appropriate application. \nWhen Applicant completed his application for student loan rehabilitation (rather \nthan forgiveness) in March 2022, he reported approximately $2,380 in monthly income \nand approximately $2,134 in monthly household expenses, leaving a monthly remainder \nof about $246 available for savings or spending. In the absence of the student loans and \nthe resolution of the delinquent charge account, there is clear evidence to indicate that \nhis financial problems are now under control, and he is currently in a better position \nfinancially than he had been. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to\nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR alleged Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in April 2008, which was discharged in \nabout July 2013, as well as 15 still-delinquent accounts, of which the 14 student loans \ntotaled approximately $101,248, and the remaining charge account totaled $2,167. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established, but there is no evidence to indicate an \nunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of an ability to do so. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(d), and 20(e) apply.

Under Chapter 13, a debtor makes payments \nthrough the Trustee to the creditors. There is no apparent connection between the \nbankruptcy and the student-loans issue. In this instance, in an effort to rehabilitate his \nstudent loans, he started the rehabilitation process and made some payments. Applicant \nwas clearly the victim of ITT Tech \u2013 a predatory for-profit college \u2013 and its lending \npractices. The attorney generals of 48 states and the CFPB went after that college and \nits holding company to extract justice for the defrauded students. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere \nis \nsome \ndisqualifying \nevidence \nregarding \nApplicant\u2019s \nfinancial \nconsiderations. He filed for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in April 2008, which was discharged \nin about July 2013. In addition, the SOR alleged 15 still-delinquent accounts, of which the \n14 student loans totaled approximately $101,248, and the remaining unpaid charge \naccount totaled $2,167. Other than a few minor payments, Applicant made little effort to \nresolve his delinquent student-loan accounts. \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial \nconsiderations. Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nserving in an unspecified position since sometime after April 2020 when he submitted his \nSF 86. He was previously employed by other employers in a variety of full-time and part-\ntime positions since September 1998. He attended ITT Tech from 2008 until 2013, but \nreceived no degree. He was granted a secret clearance in 2014. He was married in 2017. \nAlthough he filed for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in 2008, that bankruptcy was discharged in \nJuly 2013, after he complied with the requirements of the Bankruptcy Trustee. Aside from \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nthe questionable delinquent student-loan accounts, he resolved the only other delinquent \naccount in his name. Forty-eight state attorneys general and the CFPB have secured \nhundreds of millions in private student-loan forgiveness for thousands of former students \nof ITT Tech. Applicant was clearly one of the victims of ITT Tech \u2013 a predatory for-profit \ncollege \u2013 and its lending practices. There are no longer lingering questions if Applicant is \ncurrently in a better position financially than he had been, as well as any continuing doubt \nabout his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me without substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude \nApplicant has successfully mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.p.:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana, MDMA, and Adderall. The above \ndisqualifying conditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant has not used any illegal drugs since August 2020.

His conduct no longer \ncasts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that Applicant \nhas abstained from illegal drug use for an appropriate period, and that illegal drug use is \nunlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are applicable. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nApplicant\u2019s wife no longer uses illegal drugs. However, in a state where \nmarijuana is against federal law, but does not violate state law, Applicant still has some \nassociation with people who use marijuana. AG \u00b6 16(g) is applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nApplicant\u2019s wife no longer uses illegal drugs, but in a state that has made \nrecreational marijuana use legal under state law, it is increasingly difficult to cut all ties \nwith individuals who use marijuana. I am satisfied that Applicant avoids it to the extent \npossible. Applicant\u2019s association with persons involved in marijuana use occurs under \ncircumstances that do not cast doubt upon his reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. AG \u00b6 17(g) is applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and H in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns under Guidelines E (personal conduct) and H (drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

On \nNovember 12, 2021, the Department of Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe record evidence establishes Applicant has student loans placed for collection \ntotaling over $58,000; (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, 1.h-1.j, and 1.l-1.m.); two civil judgments against \nher totaling $15,726 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.t.); and eight past-due credit-card accounts \ntotaling $12,322. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, and 1.m-1s.) \nApplicant's admissions establish the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts), AG \u00b6 19 (b) (unwillingness to satisfy debts \nregardless of the ability to do so), and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions, under AG \u00b6 20, are potentially applicable: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant's delinquent debts are recent, numerous \nand ongoing. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because Applicant's debts occurred due to \ncircumstances beyond her control. She cites without further information or documentation \nthe expenses associated with her and her parent\u2019s ongoing health issues. Her student \nloans were in collection status before the COVID-19 pandemic. (Item 5 at 2-4.) Her claim \nthat her financial downturn caused by her daughter\u2019s default on her lease is not a \ncondition beyond her control. She voluntarily agreed to co-sign on the lease and pay her \ndaughter\u2019s legal expenses. Even though her debts may have occurred due to \ncircumstances beyond her control, she did not provide sufficient evidence that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances to resolve them. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of payments, \npayment plans, or other resolution of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p-q and 1.t. The fact \nthat certain debts are no longer listed in a credit report does not establish that the debt \nwas resolved. The mere fact that a debt no longer appears in a credit report does not \nestablish any meaningful, independent evidence as to the disposition of the debt. Debts \nmay fall off credit reports for various reasons, including the passage of time. See ISCR \nCase No. 18-01250 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2019). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor.

(Items 1, 3, 4, 9) \nThe Government alleged Applicant\u2019s aforementioned 2016 marijuana use and his \n2018 marijuana possession charge and 2019 conviction under Guideline H of the \nDirective (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b). Despite telling his investigator about his 2016 marijuana \nuse, he denied that allegation in his response to the SOR. He admitted the allegation \nconcerning his possession of marijuana charge and conviction. His admission is \nadopted as a finding of fact. I find that the Guideline H SOR allegations are established \nthrough Applicant\u2019s January 2021 subject interview, court records, and Applicant\u2019s \nadmission. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 9) \nIn October 2017, Applicant was fired from his job at a grocery store for stealing \nfood. Applicant claimed that he stole a $5 to $6 plate of food for one of his co-workers \nwho had no money and had not eaten in three days. When his manager confronted \nApplicant about the theft, Applicant admitted it and attempted to give his manager $50 \nto repay the grocery store for the stolen food. Applicant claimed that he was fired during \nthis meeting with his manager. Despite being required to do so, Applicant failed to \nreport this firing on the Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) he \nsubmitted in September 2020.

Under Guideline E, it also \nalleged Applicant\u2019s intentional failure to disclose his marijuana use and his delinquent \ndebts in his SF 86 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.d). In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted \nthese allegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are adopted as findings of fact. (Items 1, 2) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has several financial delinquencies, some of which are several years \nold. These delinquencies include car note debts, telecommunications debts, medical \ndebts, and several debts owed to City A. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions and shifts the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in \nmitigation. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;    \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to having insufficient funds to pay his \ndebts because he was young and did not have a steady income. This cause was not \nbeyond his control. Applicant claimed that he was making payments of $100 per month \non the debt described in SOR \u00b6 1.b. However, he provided no documentary evidence of \npayments or of a payment arrangement with this creditor or any of the other creditors \nlisted in the SOR. It is reasonable to expect Applicant to present documentation about \nthe resolution of specific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. \n16, 2016). While Applicant claimed that he disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k, he could not \nrecall why he disputed it. Therefore, he has not provided evidence of a reasonable basis \nfor his dispute. \nI am unable to find that the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond Applicant\u2019s control, that he acted responsibly under the circumstances, \nor that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. To the extent that he disputed the \nlegitimacy of one of his past-due debts, he has neither provided documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute nor has he provided evidence of his efforts to \nresolve the issue. His financial issues are ongoing and they continue to cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nFrom June to July 2016 Applicant used marijuana three to four times. He was \ncharged with possession of marijuana in 2018 and convicted in 2019. The above \ndisqualifying conditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nis potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant's last illegal drug use occurred about six years ago when he was about \n18 years old. He used marijuana three to four times. His use was infrequent. His last \ninstance of possession of marijuana occurred about four years ago when he was about \n20 years old. Both his use and possession occurred before he began working for his \ncurrent employer or applied for a security clearance. He claimed that he has no intent to \nuse illegal drugs in the future as use is incompatible with his career goals. Based upon \nthese considerations, Applicant has abstained from illegal drug use for an appropriate \nperiod, and his past, illegal drug use is unlikely to recur. His past, illegal drug use no \nlonger casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) is \nestablished. Applicant has mitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse \nsecurity concerns. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \n \nApplicant was fired from a job in 2017 for stealing. He deliberately failed to \ndivulge this firing on his SF 86 despite being required to do so. He failed to disclose his \n2016 marijuana use on his SF 86 despite being required to do so. He admitted that he \ndid not disclose this firing and his marijuana use because he was worried it would \nnegatively impact his ability to obtain a clearance. He also intentionally failed to disclose \nany of the debts that he was required to on his SF 86. While he claimed that he didn\u2019t \ndisclose his debts because he was rushed, forgot about them, or because of oversight, \nhis admitted willingness to lie to make himself look better undermines these more \ninnocent explanations. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant\u2019s case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) partially applies to Applicant\u2019s intentional failure to disclose the \naforementioned information on his SF 86. Applicant disclosed his 2017 firing to the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nGovernment during his interview before being confronted with those facts. He also \narguably disclosed his 2016 drug use prior to being confronted, although the \ninvestigator had to press him before he came clean. However, he failed to disclose \nnearly all of the delinquent debts in his SOR until his investigator confronted him. AG \u00b6 \n17(a) does not apply to Applicant\u2019s underlying conduct of theft that resulted in him being \nfired. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply to Applicant\u2019s intentional falsifications. Falsification of \nan SF 86 is not \u201cminor\u201d because it \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance \nprocess.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011). AG \u00b6 17(c) partially \napplies to Applicant\u2019s theft on the job in 2017 because it has been five years since his \nfiring. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not fully apply because, while Applicant has not stolen at work or \nbeen fired for several years, his other deceitful behavior such as intentionally lying has \noccurred much more recently. \n\u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person \nfactors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular \nfacts of a case. Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light \nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2006). Despite Applicant having partially met two of the mitigating conditions, \nnone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Overall, Applicant\u2019s dishonesty and lack of \ncandor in efforts to benefit himself leave me with concerns about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. Personal conduct security concerns are not \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F, H, and E in my whole-person analysis. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nThe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the \nfinancial considerations and personal conduct security concerns. Applicant mitigated the \ndrug involvement and substance misuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a federal contractor. When he submitted his SCA, he had been unemployed since November 2019. The record does not reflect when he was hired by his current employer. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from January 2006 to April 2010 and received an honorable discharge. He received an associate\u2019s degree in December 2017. He married in January 2007, divorced in April 2009, married in November 2009, and divorced in August 2015. He has lived with a cohabitant since June 2015. He has two children, ages 11 and 1. After Applicant was discharged from the Army, he worked for several employers from June 2010 to June 2015, when he was fired for sleeping on the job. He worked for another employer from June 2015 to December 2016, when he was fired for poor performance. He believes that he was fired because he and his supervisors disagreed about how certain tasks should be performed. He was unemployed from January 2017 to January 2018 while attending school under the GI Bill. He was employed from January to May 2018, and he voluntarily left that job because he believed he was underpaid and disrespected. He was employed from May 2018 to November 2019, when he was laid off. He was unemployed until he was hired by his current employer. (GX 2 at 17-20; GX 3 at 5-7.) The SOR alleges 20 delinquent debts totaling mo",

Jul. 12, 2016). \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a federal contractor. When he submitted \nhis SCA, he had been unemployed since November 2019. The record does not reflect \nwhen he was hired by his current employer. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army \nfrom January 2006 to April 2010 and received an honorable discharge. He received an \nassociate\u2019s degree in December 2017. He married in January 2007, divorced in April \n2009, married in November 2009, and divorced in August 2015. He has lived with a \ncohabitant since June 2015. He has two children, ages 11 and 1. \nAfter Applicant was discharged from the Army, he worked for several employers \nfrom June 2010 to June 2015, when he was fired for sleeping on the job. He worked for \nanother employer from June 2015 to December 2016, when he was fired for poor \nperformance. He believes that he was fired because he and his supervisors disagreed \nabout how certain tasks should be performed. He was unemployed from January 2017 to \nJanuary 2018 while attending school under the GI Bill. He was employed from January to \nMay 2018, and he voluntarily left that job because he believed he was underpaid and \ndisrespected. He was employed from May 2018 to November 2019, when he was laid off. \nHe was unemployed until he was hired by his current employer. (GX 2 at 17-20; GX 3 at \n5-7.) \nThe SOR alleges 20 delinquent debts totaling more than $45,000. They consist of \n11 delinquent consumer debts, 6 delinquent student loans, a child-support arrearage, a \nhome foreclosure, and a vehicle repossession. The debts are reflected in credit reports \nfrom August 2020 and May 2021.

Regarding the vehicle \nrepossession in July 2016, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.t, Applicant stated in the PSI that the value \nof the vehicle at the time of repossession was about $3,000, and that the sale of the \nvehicle was sufficient to resolve the debt. (GX 3 at 10.) The debt apparently was satisfied \nbecause there are only two auto loans reflected in the credit reports. The payments on \none auto loan are current, and the other loan was charged off for $1,002 in July 2020 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h), much later than the repossession admitted by Applicant. (GX 4 at 8, 10; GX \n5 at 3, 6.) \nAt the time of the September 2020 PSI, Applicant was unemployed, and he \nattributed all of his delinquent debts to lack of employment. He told the investigator that \nhe intended to contact his creditors and start making payments after he found a job. (GX \n3 at 10-19.) He did not dispute any of the debts. He submitted no evidence of financial \ncounseling. He did not mention any specific attempts to resolve his debts in the PSI or \nhis response to the SOR. He did not respond to the FORM. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions are established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts are numerous, recent, and were not incurred under circumstances making them \nunlikely to recur. His periods of unemployment and two divorces appear to have been \ncircumstances largely beyond his control, but he has not acted responsibly. He submitted \nno evidence of contacts with his creditors or efforts to resolve his debts even after he \nbegan working for his current employer. Although the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s and \n1.t were resolved, satisfaction of debts by repossession or foreclosure does not constitute \na \u201cgood-faith effort\u201d to resolve them. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); DoD \nDirective 5220.6 Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, \n(January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in \nAppendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \n1 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), \neffective June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR in October 4, 2021, and requested a hearing. \nThis case was assigned to me on November 30, 2021. A hearing was scheduled for \nJanuary 5, 2022, via TEAMS, and was heard on the scheduled date. At the hearing, the \nGovernment\u2019s case consisted of seven exhibits. (GEs 1-7) Applicant relied on 15 \nexhibits (AEs A-P) and one witness (himself). The transcript (Tr.) was received on \nJanuary 12, 2022. \nProcedural Issues \nPrior to the opening of the hearing, the Government amended the SOR to add \ndrug involvement, criminal conduct, and personal conduct allegations. The Government \namended the SOR a second time before the opening of the hearing to add some \nclerical changes without making any substantive changes. The amendments were \nsustained over Applicant\u2019s challenges.  \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with payments and payment plans. \nFor good cause shown, Applicant was granted 21 calendar days to supplement the \nrecord. Department Counsel was afforded three days to respond. \nWithin the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with documentation \nof a new payment plan re: SOR \u00b6 1.b; first payments on his agreed individual payment \nplans covering SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d-1.h, and 1.j; settlement offers covering SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and \n1.p, and an updated payment plan re: SOR \u00b6 1.p. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions \nwere admitted without objections as AEs Q-BB. \n Summary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR (as amended in a first and second SOR), \nApplicant accumulated (a) filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in March 2015 and was \ndischarged in bankruptcy in June 2015 and (b) accumulated 15 delinquent post-\nbankruptcy medical and consumer debts exceeding $30,000. Allegedly, these debts \nraised post-bankruptcy discharge concern that have not been resolved. \nUnder Guideline H, Applicant allegedly was found guilty of marijuana possession-\ncivil in November 2020. Allegedly, the civil conviction arose out of an arrest in July \n2020. Under Guideline J, Applicant allegedly was arrested in July 2020 for point/ \nbrandishing of a firearm in his state of residence. \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly falsified his electronic questionnaire \nfor investigations processing (e-QIP) of February 2021, by failing to disclose his civil \nconviction of November 2020 for possession of marijuana. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations covered \nby Guideline F with explanations.

He also claimed that he accumulated additional debts while \ntrying to keep his private transportation business operating during an emergent COVID-\n19 pandemic. Applicant further claimed that he is doing all he can do to repay his \ncreditors (some related to his unsuccessful business venture) with the funds available to \nhim.  \nAddressing the allegations covered by Guideline H, Applicant admitted the \nallegations with explanations. He claimed he paid the imposed $25 civil fine on his July \n2020 civil arrest for possession of marijuana found in his vehicle. He claimed he has \nnever had a recurrent marijuana possession arrest. \nResponding to the SOR allegations covered by Guideline J, Applicant admitted \nhis July 2020 arrest for point/brandishing a firearm in his state of residence. He claimed \nhe felt threatened by the driver of a vehicle that pulled up beside him, and moved his \nhandgun on the seat of his vehicle, in an act of self-defense. He claimed he was \narrested by police shortly thereafter. Appearing in court, he claimed the charges were \ndismissed. \nResponding to the falsification allegations covered by Guideline E, Applicant \ndenied the allegations with explanations and clarifications. He claimed his drug-\npossession citation omission in his February 2021 e-QIP was an oversight and not the \nresult of any intent on his part to withhold the requested information \nApplicant added whole-person explanations as well in his response to the SOR. \nHe claimed to have benefitted from his experiences in the Marine Corps and is a \nreliable and trustworthy person with good judgment. He further claimed that the \nincidents covered by Guideline H and J pose no threat to national security. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor who is sponsoring \nhim for a security clearance.

(GE 1) \nApplicant enlisted in the Marine Corp in July 2008 and served four years of active duty \nbefore receiving an honorable discharge in July 2012. (GE 1 and AE D) \nSince August 2021, Applicant has been employed on a part-time basis as an \naviation supply specialist while waiting for approval of his security clearance. (Tr. 59-60) \nHis employer of record since December 2020 continues to sponsor him as a supply \ndistribution specialist contract. (GE 1; Tr. 59-60) Between November 2018 and \nDecember 2020, he operated his own medical transportation company as a limited \nliability corporation (LLC). (GE 1; Tr. 36-37) Previously, he worked for other employers \nfollowing his military discharge. Applicant has held a security clearance since he was 19 \nyears of age and enlisted in the Marine Corps. (Tr. 27) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nFaced with delinquent accounts he could no longer safely manage, Applicant \nfiled for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in March 2015. (GE 3) His petition included no \nreal property schedules, but did include a schedule of personal property totaling \n$26,650. (GE 3) Creditors holding secured claims exceeded $36,000, and creditors \nholding non-secured claims exceeded $124,000. (GE 3; Tr. 69) \nApplicant acknowledged his receipt of on-line counseling in his petition without \ndetailing what his counseling included. (GE 3; Tr. 70) He reported net monthly income \nof $1,968 and monthly expenses of $1,425. (GE 3) \nLooking forward to a fresh start following his June 2015 bankruptcy discharge, \nApplicant encountered some stiff financial winds from a difficult divorce in April 2017 \nand accumulated additional delinquent debts between April 2017 and 2019. (GEs 2 and \n7; Tr. 70) Altogether, he accumulated 15 delinquent debts exceeding $30,000. (GEs 2 \nand 7) The SOR covers delinquent student loan, medical, and consumer debts. \nOf Applicant\u2019s listed delinquent debts, he has since paid off three debts as \nfollows: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c (for $1,367), 1.k (for $250), and 1.m (for $181). (AEs 1 and K; Tr. \n32, 34) Additionally, he arranged monthly payment plans with SOR creditors 1.b ($115 a \nmonth), 1.d ($45 a month), 1.e ($75 a month), 1.f ($92 a month), 1.g ($41 a month), and \n1.h/1.j $69 a month. (AEs Q-Z; tr. 32-36, 71-76) With these payment plans, Applicant \nhas made first payments and in several cases second payments, but for the most part \nhis payment plans are in the early phases and are expected to continue for many \nmonths without any definitive track records to work from. \nIn two cases, Applicant has received offers of settlement, for which he has yet to \nrespond: SOR creditor \u00b6 1.i (for a lump sum payment of $200) and SOR creditor \u00b6 1.p \n(for a lump sum payment of $2,500). (AEs AA and BB) Whether Applicant has or will \nhave the available resources to meet the offer terms of these creditors in the \nforeseeable future is unclear. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the on-line financial counseling Applicant certified to in his Chapter \n7 bankruptcy petition in 2015, he has received financial counseling from a non-profit \ncounseling firm in December 2021. (AE L; Tr. 83-84) Available counseling services \nincluded budget analysis, customizing action planning, and recovery options or \nalternatives regarding his debts. (AE L) How much he benefitted from his financial \ncounseling services cannot be assessed from the counseling plan itself without more \ninput from Applicant. Concrete benefits gained from Applicant\u2019s counseling is still \nincomplete.  Applicant\u2019s plans call for him to pay $500 a month on his outstanding SOR \ndebts and work on them until they are fully paid. (Tr. 87-88, 93-94, 106) Currently, he \nearns between $2,700 and $3,200 a month from his temporary employer. (AE L; Tr. 84-\n85) While operating his own company (2018-2020), he earned very little. (Tr. 64-65)  \nApplicant\u2019s involvement with illegal drugs \n \n \nIn July 2020, Applicant was stopped by police and cited for marijuana \npossession-civil after searching officers found a package of marijuana in Applicant\u2019s \nvehicle. (GE 4; Tr. 38-39, 42-44) The marijuana had been gifted to him by his sister to \nhelp relieve the stress he was experiencing from the sudden and unexpected loss of his \naunt in a traffic accident. (Tr. 42-44) \nApplicant assured he never opened the gifted bag containing the marijuana and \nwas unaware of the bag\u2019s contents when he was stopped and searched by police. (Tr. \n97-98) Appearing in court in November 2020 in a state district court in the state of his \nresidence, Applicant was fined $25. (GE 4) Applicant sees his sister monthly. (Tr. 79). \nShe is a 100 per cent disabled veteran and self-medicates with marijuana; although she \nnever uses marijuana in Applicant\u2019s presence. (Tr. 79, 90) \nApplicant denies using marijuana before or after his marijuana possession arrest \nand is corroborated in part by negative drug test results from a non-randomized drug \ntest he submitted to in December 2021. (AE M; Tr. 45) The record does not contain any \nprobative evidence of any prior use of illegal drugs (marijuana included) before his \nmarijuana possession citation in November 2020. Supporting Applicant\u2019s assurances of \nfuture abstinence from all illegal drug use is a statement of intent he signed in \nDecember 2021. (AE A; Tr. 45-46) \nIn his statement he assured under oath not to misuse substances in the future \n(inclusive of illegal drugs and legal prescription drugs without a prescription), at the risk \nof an automatic revocation of his security clearance in the event of a violation of his \noath. (AE A) Applicant\u2019s assurances are credible and accepted. \nApplicant\u2019s firearm pointing/brandishing arrest \nAfter being stopped by police in July 2020 and searched, Applicant was arrested \nfor pointing and brandishing a firearm at an individual (presumably a police officer from \nthe arrest report) who had pulled up beside Applicant and reported his pointing and \nbrandishing his firearm at him.

(GE 5; Tr. 50-51, 95-96) \nAt the time of his arrest, Applicant was licensed in his state of residence to carry \na firearm. (AE C; Tr. 51-52) He has never before or since been cited or arrested for a \nweapons violation. (Tr. 54-55) \nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP omission  \nAsked to complete an e-QIP in February 2021, Applicant omitted his July 2020 \nmarijuana possession arrest. (GE 1) He attributed his omission to a good faith lapse in \nmemory. (Tr. 81) When interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) several months later, he never mentioned the marijuana \npossession incident either and was not confronted by the investigator. (GE 7; Tr. 82) \nApplicant has no record of marijuana involvement, either before or after his July \n2020 citation. He displayed both honesty and candor throughout the hearing process. \nHis memory lapse in disclosing his marijuana possession incident in the e-QIP he \ncompleted in February 2021 can be attributable in part to his never opening the gifted \nbag from his sister containing the marijuana and his being unaware of the bag\u2019s \ncontents. His explanations and lack of any prior marijuana use or involvement support a \nfinding that his omission reflects a credible mistake or inadvertence on his part and is \naccepted. (GEs 1 and 7) \nConsidering all of the circumstances of Applicant\u2019s 2021 e-QIP omission of his \nmarijuana possession citation, inferences are warranted that the omission does not \nreflect any knowing and willful intent to falsify his e-QIP. Inferences that the allegations \nof falsification are unsubstantiated are warranted. \nEndorsements and awards \nApplicant is well regarded by friends and colleagues who have worked with him. \n(AE G) Uniformly, they consider him to be honest and trustworthy.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n           \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n   \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.

See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick \non Evidence \u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006). His admitted debts are fully documented and create \njudgment issues as well over the management of his finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). Although he qualified his admissions with \nexplanations, his admissions can be weighed along with other evidence developed \nduring the hearing.  \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s cited financial difficulties associated with his Chapter 7 bankruptcy \npetition and discharge and recurrent delinquent debt accruals preclude him from taking \nadvantage of most of the potentially available extenuating and mitigating benefits. While \nsome extenuating benefit to Applicant is warranted based on his reported struggles with \nhis finances following the death of his aunt and unsuccessful business venture, \npersonal obligations for his owed student loan, consumer, and medical debts remained \noutstanding and unresolved following his return to full-time employment in December \n2020, and required his earnest attention. \nApplication of mitigating condition MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d partially applies. While Applicant is able to \nfulfill the first prong of MC \u00b6 20(b) with his cited unsuccessful business venture, his \nfailure to satisfy the second prong (\u201cacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) of MC \n20(b) is conjunctive in its application and is the key prong that prevents him from \ngaining any more than limited application of MC 20(b). \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts.

On the strength of the evidence \npresented, two disqualifying conditions (DCs) of the AGs for drug involvement apply to \nApplicant\u2019s situation: DC \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201dany substance misuse,\u201d and 25(c), \u201cillegal \npossession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of Illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia.\u201d \nTo his credit, Applicant has committed to sustained abstinence from all \ninvolvement in illegal drugs and non-prescribed prescription drugs. His lone marijuana \npossession citation represents an isolated incident that has not been repeated. Neither \nbefore nor since his marijuana possession citation in July 2020 has he used or \npossessed any illegal drugs (marijuana included) or prescription drugs without a \nprescription. His assurances are corroborated by a recent non-randomized drug test \nthat produce negative results. Applicant has remained abstinent from illegal and non-\nprescribed prescription drugs and exhibits no visible signs or indications of succumbing \nto any risks or pressures he might encounter to return to illegal drug use in the \nforeseeable future. \nApplicant\u2019s assurances of sustained abstinence from illegal drugs (inclusive of \nmarijuana) are encouraging. And, his efforts warrant application of one mitigating \ncondition (MCs) of the drug involvement guideline: MC \u00b6 26(b), \u201cthe individual \nacknowledges his or her drug-involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence of \n11 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, \nincluding, but not limited to, (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, \nacknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility.\u201d \nWithout more probative evidence of more recent marijuana use or possession by \nApplicant since his last positive drug test in October 2013, Applicant is entitled to \nfavorable conclusions of sustained abstinence for the past eight years. His negative \ndrug test (although not randomized along with stated intent not to use illegal drugs in \nthe future, and favorable character references are enough to facilitate safe predictions \nthat he is no longer a recurrence risk. \nCriminal conduct concerns \nSecurity concerns related to Applicant\u2019s firearm arrest in July 2020 is an isolated \nmisdemeanor incident that was nolle prossed at Applicant\u2019s court appearance in \nNovember 2020. At the time, Applicant had a permit to carry a firearm, and the firearm \nwas openly displayed on his seat when surprised by the stranger (presumed police \nofficer) who pulled along-side of him. There have been no recurrent offenses (before or \nafter the 2020 incident), and the risks of recurrence are negligible. Favorable \nconclusions are warranted. \nPersonal conduct concerns \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s 2021 e-QIP omissions of his 2020 \nmarijuana possession citation and imposed $25 fine. Applicant\u2019s omission was \ninadvertent and did not involve any intent to withhold important background information \nfrom the Government. Allegations of falsification of Applicant\u2019s e-QIP by omitting his \nmarijuana possession citation are unsubstantiated. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance. While Applicant is entitled to credit for his work in the defense \nindustry and making some progress in addressing his debt delinquencies, his efforts are \nnot enough at this time to overcome her failures to make more concerted earlier efforts \nto resolve accumulated student loan, medical, and consumer debts. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. Drug involvement, criminal, and personal conduct \nconcerns are mitigated.

Applicant \nresponded in an October 21, 2021 Answer to the SOR, and requested that her case be \ndecided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing. \nOn December 13, 2021, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing four Items and \na Request for Administrative Notice, was mailed to Applicant on December 14, 2021, and \nreceived by her on December 26, 2021.

On March 8, 2022, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me. I received the \ncase file on March 14, 2022. Items 1 through 4 are admitted into evidence. \nDepartment Counsel also submitted a request for administrative notice of certain \nfacts about Poland, in the FORM. The facts detailed in the official U.S. Government \npublication that was attached to the request were neither disputed nor objected to by \nApplicant. Accordingly, I take judicial notice of those facts, a summary of which will be \nincluded in the following findings. \nFindings of Fact  \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations contained in the \nSOR without further elaboration, evidence, or explanation. These allegations involved the \nfact that her mother, father, sister, and brother are all resident citizens of Poland. Her \nadmissions are incorporated into these findings of fact. \nApplicant is 40 years old. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in Poland in May 2003, \nand a master\u2019s degree from a U.S. university in May 2008. She has never served in the \nmilitary or worked for the governments of either Poland or the United States. This is her \nfirst application for national security eligibility, which she seeks in connection with her \ndefense contractor position as a linguist in Poland that she obtained in February 2020. \n(Item 3; Item 4.) \nApplicant was born and raised in Poland. In June 2003, after completing her \neducation there, she was accepted into a one-year au pair program and came to the \nUnited States to travel and further improve her English language skills. While here on that \nJ1 visa she applied for an F1 student visa, which was granted. She remained while \npursuing her master\u2019s degree at a U.S. university from September 2004 until May 2008. \nShe married a native U.S. citizen in March 2008, becoming a permanent resident until \nher naturalization as U.S. citizen in January 2012. Shortly thereafter, her divorce from her \nhusband was finalized in June 2012. She has retained her Polish citizenship and has \nactive passports from both nations. She claimed to have \u201cequal allegiance to the U.S., \nPoland, and [her] family in Poland.\u201d (Item 3; Item 4.) \nAfter her divorce, Applicant lived in a home owned by her aunt and uncle when \nshe was in the United States. She held full-time U.S. jobs from October 2018 to December \n2019 and from August 2015 to September 2018, as well as part-time jobs from February \n2016 to September 2018, and from April 2018 to June 2018. She also worked in two full-\ntime administrative positions in the medical field from April 2012 to October 2013, and as \na part-time caregiver for a U.S. home nursing company from July 2005 to February 2014. \n(Item 3; Item 4.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring that time she returned to Poland on numerous occasions to visit family and \nlook for employment there so she could move back. She was unsuccessful in finding a \njob in Poland until obtaining her current job in February 2020. Since her U.S. \nnaturalization and divorce were final, she visited Poland from February 2014 to July 2015, \nfrom December 2017 to January 2018, from June 2018 to August 2018, and from \nDecember 2019 to present. She lived with her parents from December 2019 to February \n2020, then moved into military housing on a Polish Army base where she works. She \nwanted to return and live in Poland to be close to her family. (Item 3; Item 4.) \nAs Applicant admitted in her Answer, her mother, father, sister, and brother are \nnative citizens and residents of Poland. Her mother and brother are dentists, her father is \na retired provincial commander of the State Fire Service, and her sister is an ENT doctor. \nHer mother and father are in their late sixties, and her siblings are 42 and 39 years old. \n(Item 2, Item 4.) \nThe record contains no other significant evidence concerning Applicant\u2019s job \nperformance, trustworthiness, character in a professional setting, or track record with \nrespect to handling sensitive information and observation of security procedures. I was \nunable to evaluate her credibility, demeanor, or character in person, since she elected to \nhave her case decided without a hearing. \nAs noted above, I take administrative notice of the facts about Poland that were \nset forth in the official U.S. Government publication that was attached to Department \nCounsel\u2019s request for administrative notice. These include that Poland is a stalwart ally \nof the United States, who is a NATO member, and with whom a strong relationship and \na shared commitment to freedom date back to the American Revolution. \nPolicies \nThe national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis  \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concerns regarding foreign influence: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two of them are established by the facts of this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person who is a citizen of, or has \nclose family members residing in a foreign country, is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying \nunder Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for \nforeign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. \nSee ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \nAs noted by Department Counsel in the FORM, \u201cWhile U.S.-Polish relations are \ngenerally positive, \u2018Guideline B does not differentiate between friendly and hostile \ncountries.\u2019 As even \u2018countries with stable, democratic or representative forms of \ngovernment engage in intelligence gathering\u2019 activities that place U.S. interests at risk.\u201d \nCiting ISCR Case No. 02-22461 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005.) \nApplicant has normal, commendable, and strong familial connections with her \nparents and siblings, all of whom are distinguished professionals. She returned to live \nand work in Poland after her divorce in order to maintain her close and regular contact \nwith them. All of them are Polish citizens who reside in Poland. These relationships create \na heightened risk of foreign pressure, coercion, and exploitation because Poland\u2019s close \ninteractions with U.S. forces in pursuit of NATO objectives expose a range of sensitive \nand protected U.S. military and technology assets to intelligence gathering. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s citizenship, residence, and relationship with her family members in \nPoland, also create a potential conflict of interest between her obligation to protect \nsensitive information or technology and her desire to help family members and her native \ncountry, should she or they be pressured, manipulated, induced, or inclined to obtain \naccess to such information. Further heightening these risks is Applicant\u2019s employment \nas a linguist for a defense contractor providing full-time direct support to U.S. and NATO \nmilitary forces, and her residence on a Polish military base. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions, shifting the burden to Applicant to prove mitigation. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns. \nThose with potential application in mitigating the security concerns in this case are: \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant did not establish that it is unlikely that she could be placed in a position \nof having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual or government and those \nof the United States as a consequence of her and her family\u2019s residences and citizenships \nin Poland. Those connections create continuing and significant potential for conflict of \ninterest and risk of coercion, exploitation, manipulation, or pressure. Applicant also has \nminimal connections to the United States, where she moved in 2003 to work as an au \npair, and then remained to obtain a master\u2019s degree in four years. She married a U.S. \ncitizen in 2008, obtained citizenship in 2012, and divorced soon thereafter. She then \nbegan visiting Poland and seeking work so she could move back to her native country \nand be near her family. She retains her Polish citizenship, and she lives and works on a \nPolish military base. On balance, the evidence demonstrates significant potential for \nconflict of interest. Accordingly, Applicant failed to establish sufficient mitigation with \nrespect to her relationships with her family and the nation of Poland under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), \n(b), or (c). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature and \naccomplished person, with commendable family relations. and an allegiance to them and \nto Poland. Nothing indicates any misconduct or behavioral concerns in this case. There \nremains significant potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress, however, \nwhich is most likely to continue. Applicant honestly expressed equal allegiance to the \nUnited States, Poland, and her family. While there may be no impediment to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a Polish or NATO security clearance of some type, she failed to meet her \nburden to mitigate the concerns arising under the Foreign Influence guideline governing \nU.S. national security eligibility. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information.

The Government\u2019s evidence is \nidentified as Items 2 through 9. (Item 1 is the SOR).

He \ndenied the SOR allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a, 3.b and 4.a. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 28 years old. He is a high school graduate. He attended community \ncollege from January 2012 to May 2012. He attended another college from August 2014 \nto May 2017. He did not earn a degree.

In his October 2020 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed that he \nhas worked for a federal contractor since May 2018 and also works part-time in another \njob since August 2020. Applicant is not married and has no children. (Item 3) \nSection 26 of Applicant\u2019s October 2020 SCA asked if in the past seven years he \nhad any debts turned over to a collection agency? He answered \u201cNo.\u201d The SOR alleges \nin \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f federal student loan accounts that were placed in collection. The \nalleged debts total approximately $32,340. (Items 5, 6, 7) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in March 2021. Applicant \ndenied to the investigator having any delinquent federal debt or debts turned over to a \ncollection agency in the last seven years. He was then confronted with his delinquent \nstudent loans that were in collection. He explained that he attended college and took out \nstudent loans. He said the creditors never contacted him and he never contacted the \ncreditors. He said he called Credit Karma and his accounts were listed as closed. He took \nno further action at that point to repay the loans. He had not closed the accounts. He told \nthe investigator that he had no reason for failing to repay the student loans. He had \nplanned to go back to school, but never had the time. (Item 9) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the delinquent student loans and \nsaid he had contacted the creditor and the debts were now consolidated. He stated that \nthe creditor \u201cgave me a monthly estimate of [$]167/month, which can easily be done.\u201d He \nprovided no documentary evidence to show he has an agreement with the creditor, that \nhe started to make payments, or has taken any other action to resolve the debts. (Item 2) \nApplicant denied that he deliberately failed to disclose his delinquent student loans \non his SCA in response to section 26. He stated that he had an interview with a \ngovernment investigator and said: \u201cWhen I had the Zoom call [with] the investigator, she \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nalerted me. I told her I thought it had been handled, after it disappeared from my credit \nreport. The student loans are the reason my credit score is as low as it is.\u201d (Items 2, 9) \nApplicant\u2019s August 2020 credit report reflects the student loans alleged in the SOR \nare in a collection status. His credit report from January 2021 also reflects the student \nloans are in collection status and have been delinquent since about 2018. His March 2022 \ncredit report shows each student loan as past due and in collection status. (Items 5, 6, 7) \nApplicant told the investigator that his finances were fine and he was working two \njobs. He did not have other delinquent debts. He did not list his student loans because \nthey appeared as closed on his credit report. He lives within his means and will try and \nset up a payment plan for this student loans. (Item 9) \nApplicant was arrested in August 2019 and charged with Driving While Intoxicated \n(DWI). He was arrested and charged in October 2019 for Contempt of Court: Failure to \nAppear. Applicant admitted he was arrested and charged with DWI and described the \nincident as an \u201coutlier.\u201d (Item 2) He said he went to driving school, paid the court fines, \nand had his license suspended for a year. Court documents reflect he also received a 90-\nday jail sentence that was suspended. (Item 8) \nApplicant said it has been three years since the DWI offense and he has not had \nanother incident. He denied he has a problem with alcohol and said that the DWI was a \nfirst offense. He said he disclosed the DWI to his security manager the day after it \noccurred. The Continuous Evaluation Report reflects on January 15, 2020, the DWI and \nfailure to appear arrests were validated. He admitted he made a mistake and paid the \nprice. (Items 4, 8) \nApplicant denied that he was arrested for failing to appear in court and said it was \na misunderstanding he had with his attorney. Court documents reflect that he was found \nguilty of failing to appear and was fined $150 and court costs of $87. (Item 8) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has student loans totaling approximately $32,000 that have been \ndelinquent since about 2018. He has not made any payments on the loans. He stated \nthat his finances are fine, he has two jobs, and lives within his means, yet he never \ncontacted the student loan creditor to address his delinquent debts or made an effort until \nafter he was interviewed by a government investigator. He has not provided evidence that \nhe has made any payments. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe persons control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attended college in 2012 and again in 2014 to 2017. He used student \nloans to fund his education. He never contacted the creditor to begin repaying his loans. \nIt is unclear why he believed he was not responsible for repaying his $32,340 student \nloan debt. He says he believed his accounts were closed. His three credit reports show \neach of his student loans are past-due and in collection status. He said he has since \ncontacted the creditor to have the loans consolidated, and he can afford the monthly \namount proposed. He failed to provide proof that he has begun repaying the loans. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to follow through and contact the creditors for his student loans when \nthey became due casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. There \nis no evidence his financial issues were beyond his control. He did not act responsibly in \naddressing his student loans when they were due. He said he has an affordable payment \nplan with the creditor, but provided no documentary evidence that he has implemented it \nand is paying his delinquent student loans. None of the above mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concerns for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder.  \nIn August 2019, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI, 1st offense. He was \nfound guilty of the offense. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Guideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \nApplicant stated that this was his first offense and he has not had any alcohol-\nrelated incidents since then. He acknowledged it was an \u201coutlier.\u201d It appears this was an \nisolated incident and there is no other evidence that Applicant has an issue with alcohol. \nHe admitted he made a mistake and paid a price. He completed the terms of his sentence, \npaid the fine and had his license revoked for a year. It has been three years since the \noffense with no other issues, and it is unlikely that similar conduct will recur in the future. \nI find the above mitigating conditions apply. \nThe security concerns for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nIn 2019, Applicant was found guilty of DWI and failure to appear in court. The \nabove disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant was found guilty of DWI and failure to appear. He completed the terms \nof the DWI sentence and paid the fine for the failure to appear offense. He explained the \nfailure to appear was a misunderstanding with his attorney. There is no other evidence of \ncriminal conduct, and it appears this was an aberration. The same analysis under \nGuideline G, alcohol consumption applies to this guideline. The above mitigating \nconditions apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the trustworthiness concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \nApplicant\u2019s convictions for DWI and failure to appear were cross alleged under the \npersonal conduct guideline. I have considered the above disqualifying conditions and find \nthat this conduct is explicitly covered under the criminal conduct guideline and AG \u00b6 16(d) \ndoes not apply. However, AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) apply because his conduct when \nconsidered as a whole supports an assessment of questionable judgment and is the type \nof conduct that could impact his personal, professional and standing in the community. \nApplicant failed to disclose his student loans on his SCA. Applicant stated that \nbecause he checked Credit Karma and believed his accounts were closed, he took no \nfurther action. Although grossly misguided, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that \nhe deliberately failed to disclose his delinquent student loans on his SCA. Hence, AG \u00b6 \n16(a) does not apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur.  \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct occurred in 2019 and he admits he made a mistake \nand paid a price. He has not been involved in any misconduct since then. The same \nanalysis under the criminal conduct and alcohol consumption guidelines apply under the \npersonal conduct guideline. The above mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F, G, J and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant attended college in 2012 and again in 2014 through 2017, and financed \nhis education with student loans. He provided no evidence that he made any payments \non his student loans when due. They have been in collection status since at least 2018. \nHe made no effort to contact the creditor until after he was interviewed by a government \ninvestigator. Applicant indicated that a payment plan was proposed by the creditor that \nhe could afford, but he provided no proof he has made any payments. He has not acted \nresponsibly towards his debts. Applicant has failed to establish a reliable financial track \nrecord and failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. He mitigated the security concerns under \nGuideline E, personal conduct, Guideline G, alcohol consumption, and Guideline J, \ncriminal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph   4.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n* \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Although his \nstatements to abstain from cocaine use are credible, his state intention to abstain from \nmarijuana is not. He has relied on marijuana to treat ongoing medical issues.

He reported his last use as being in February 2021. (GE 4-5) \nIn 2009, Applicant\u2019s parents took him to see a substance abuse counselor about \nhis marijuana use. Through those sessions, which took place between July and August \n2009, Applicant was not diagnosed with a substance abuse disorder, but realized that \nhe used the drug to address anxiety and pain. Since then, Applicant has continued to \nuse marijuana to self-medicate. (GE 4-5) \nApplicant was interviewed by a background investigator in March 2021. In his \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories in August 2021, Applicant reviewed and made minor \nchanges to the report of investigation prepared by the background investigator. The \nchanges included corrections to misspelled names of family members and a correction \nto information about his employment history. He did not make any corrections to the \ndisclosures he made about his history of illegal drug use or his statements of intent \nregarding his future use of marijuana. Applicant reported to the background investigator \nthat he used marijuana eight to twelve times a week and that he purchased the drug \nmonthly at a local dispensary. He conveyed his intent to use marijuana in the future to \nalleviate his ongoing issues with pain and anxiety. While he stated that he would stop \nusing the drug if it were necessary to obtain a security clearance, he admitted that he \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwould resume use if federal policy on the issue changed. Applicant told the investigator \nthat he continued to associate with friends who used marijuana and admitted that he \nhad not made any changes to his lifestyle to encourage abstinence. (GE 5) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant reported his last use of marijuana as being in \nMarch 2021, the month he completed his security clearance application. He also \nprovided a drug screen report dated January 2022, showing that he tested negative for \nboth cocaine and marijuana. Applicant did not offer any current information either in \nresponse to the SOR or the FORM about an alternate treatment for his pain and anxiety \nissues or changes in his life to support abstinence from illegal drug use. He did not \nprovide a signed statement of intent to abstain from illegal drug use in the future. \nHowever, he volunteered to submit to random drug testing. (GE 3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nThe illegal use of controlled substances can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability and trustworthiness because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. (AG \u00b6 16) The record contains \nevidence to support the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant engaged in \ndisqualifying conduct under the drug involvement and substance misuse guideline. \nApplicant admits using cocaine between 2008 and February 2021. He also \nadmits to using and purchasing marijuana between May 2007 and March 2021, the \nmonth he completed his security clearance application. He indicated his intent to use \nmarijuana in the future to address ongoing medical issues. The following disqualifying \nconditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 17(a) any substance misuse; and \nAG \u00b6 17(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse. \nNone of the applicable mitigating conditions apply. Even though Applicant\u2019s last \nreported illegal drug use occurred in March 2021, the conduct is not mitigated by the \npassage of time. This period of abstinence is not sufficient given his long history of drug \nuse. Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana, in particular, did not occur under \nunusual circumstances that are unlikely to recur. He admits that he uses marijuana to \nself-medicate ongoing medical issues. Although Applicant stated that he would abstain \nfrom marijuana use if required to obtain a security clearance, his promise to abstain is \nnot clearly convincing. He has not sought alternative medical treatments or other coping \nmechanisms to treat these issues. His social circle still consists of individuals who use \nmarijuana recreationally, and he has not made any changes to support prolonged \nabstinence from the drug. He has not proffered a written statement of intent to abstain \nfrom illegal drug use. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWhole-person Concept \nBased on the record, Applicant is not a suitable candidate for access to classified \ninformation at this time. This decision is not changed by a consideration of the facts \nunder the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant failed to meet his burdens \nof persuasion and production to mitigate the alleged concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

When he graduated from college in \n2017, he was unable to pay his student loans because he was underemployed or \nunemployed.

He has not made any payments on his student loans since graduating from \ncollege.

He told the creditor that he could \nonly afford to pay what was originally owed and could not afford the added interest. He \ntestified that with his other expenses, he has not paid the debt because the amount is too \nmuch. He said he could afford to pay $100. In his September 2021 answer to the SOR, \nhe stated, \u201cI am not aware of a [creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.m] debt that requires a payment. \nCurrently working on a payment plan to execute and have that debt paid off.\u201d (Answer to \nSOR) He testified that he does have a plan to pay the debt, but has not executed it.

After his hearing, Applicant provided a \nsettlement agreement with the creditor. He was to make an initial payment on December \n12, 2022, of $100 and a final payment on January 12, 2023 of $374. He provided a copy \nof the settlement agreement. He did not provide proof he made the first payment. (Tr. 17-\n22; AE B) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n ($167) was for unpaid insurance. He provided a receipt that \nthe debt was paid. (Tr. 22-23; Answer to SOR) \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o through 1.t are unpaid utility bills. Applicant explained he \nand his roommates were renting a house together while in school. The utilities were in \nApplicant\u2019s name. Applicant moved out and his roommates remained, but they did not \npay the utilities. When he learned the bills were unpaid, he contacted his former \nroommates who gave him the money to pay the bills. He stated he would provide proof \nthat the debts were paid.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nApplicant has student loans that were in a collection status before the pandemic. \nDuring the pandemic, they were put in a deferred status, which will likely expire in the \nupcoming months. He had a credit card debt that was charged off and other delinquent \ndebts. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions\nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant attended college and obtained student loans from 2008 to 2017, totaling \napproximately $50,734. These loans were placed in deferred status twice because he \nwas unable to make payments. He was unable to have them deferred a third time. and \nthey went into collection status. He was underemployed and unemployed until December \n2020. He said he did not think about repaying his student loans until he realized they may \ncreate a hindrance for him obtaining a security clearance for his job. He completed a SCA \nin January 2021. In August 2022, he submitted an application to rehabilitate his student \nloans. His application has not been acted upon, and he has not made any payments on \nhis student loans. Applicant also had a delinquent credit card that remained unpaid. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and ongoing. He did not take meaningful action to \naddress his student loans until he applied for a rehabilitation program in August 2022, \nabout 20 months after he completed his SCA. He has not started a repayment plan and \ndoes not have a reliable financial track record of payments. After his hearing, he \nnegotiated a settlement agreement on a credit card that had been charged off. He has \nnot completed the terms of the settlement. At this juncture, I cannot find that future \nfinancial issues are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20 (a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment and underemployment were beyond his control. \nHowever, he failed to act responsibly regarding his delinquent student loans until after he \napplied for a security clearance, and that action has been minimal, as no payments have \nyet been made. He did not reach a settlement agreement with the credit card creditor until \nafter his hearing concluded. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAn applicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after having been \nplaced on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and \nwillingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not \nthreatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). \nThere is evidence that Applicant paid the delinquent utility bills and paid his past-\ndue insurance (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n \u2013 1.t). AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to these debts. There is no evidence \nthat he has participated in financial counseling. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nApplicant testified that he intends to repay his student loans and resolve his other \ndebts. However, intentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record \nof debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). Applicant did not reach a settlement on his credit card debt until \nafter his hearing. He did not provide proof of his first payment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant does not have a reliable financial track record. At this juncture, it is too \nearly to conclude that his financial issues are no longer a security concern. Applicant has \nnot met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.n-1.t: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe evidence in the FORM falls short of establishing the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nApplicant denied this allegation in his answer to the SOR, and he asserted in the PSI that \nhe had satisfied the judgment. As noted in Egan, the Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. The FORM contains no evidence \nshowing that the judgment is unsatisfied. Thus, I have resolved SOR \u00b6 1.a for Applicant. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are sufficient to establish the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and \n1.c. He denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.d, but the March 2018 credit report is sufficient \nto establish this allegation. He denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.e in his answer to the \nSOR, but he admitted in his SCA that he was negotiating with the collection agency, and \nhe admitted in PSI that he had made two payments on this debt and then stopped. His \nadmissions are sufficient to establish the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.e.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM are sufficient to establish \nthe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant's delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. The total loss of Applicant\u2019s vehicle was a \ncircumstance largely beyond his control, but he has not acted responsibly. He provided \nno evidence to show that the insurance payment on his vehicle was less than he was \nentitled to under the terms of the policy. He submitted no evidence of negotiations with \nhis insurance company or the creditor. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant provided no evidence of financial \ncounseling, and his financial problems are not under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Although Applicant asserted that he made two \npayments on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, he admitted that he had stopped making \npayments before the debt was resolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Although Applicant stated in the PSI that he \ndisagreed with the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, he provided no evidence of a \nfactual basis for his disagreement. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

In 2007, he received a Bachelor of \nScience in construction management, and he has worked as a construction engineer for \nhis current employer, a defense contractor, since 2008. He was granted a top secret (TS) \nsecurity clearance in 2010, and in September 2015, he was granted a TS security \nclearance with Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) access. (GE 1-2; Tr. 11, 17-\n18, 26) \nApplicant admitted using hallucinogenic mushrooms on two occasions in about \nOctober 2018 and November 2020, after having been granted access to classified \ninformation, as alleged in the SOR. Applicant does not consider himself to be a drug user, \nrather he made a bad decision while he was grieving the death of his friend\u2019s father. He \nthen repeated this mistake with the same friend \u201cunder the belief that the damage \u2026 was \nalready done \u2026 .\u201d (Answer; GE 1-2; Tr. 13, 21, 23) \nIn October 2018, Applicant\u2019s college friend\u2019s father passed away. The man had \nbeen a mentor to him. Applicant agreed leave his home that night and drive to another \nstate, where his friend\u2019s family owns a ranch, to help them. Two nights after he arrived, \nApplicant\u2019s friend offered him hallucinogenic mushrooms after dinner. His friend was \naware that Applicant had a security clearance. At the hearing, Applicant was unable to \nexplain why he chose to ingest the mushrooms other than to relieve the grief that he was \nexperiencing. They produced an overall helpful or pleasurable effect on him. He returned \nto his home a day or two later. (Answer; Tr. 20-22, 27-28) \nWhen Applicant returned to work, he did not disclose his illegal drug use to his \nsupervisor, facility security officer (FSO), or anyone else. He did not disclose his drug use \nto his wife. He continued to communicate with his friend during the subsequent two years \nalmost exclusively via text messages. (Tr. 22) \nIn November 2020, Applicant\u2019s friend traveled to visit him, and they went to \nApplicant\u2019s mother\u2019s cabin to hunt elk together. While at the cabin, according to Applicant: \nThe night that I consumed the psilocybe again, he made it obvious that he \nhad some and applied, I guess, a little bit of peer pressure that he, you \nknow, he didn\u2019t want to do it alone and all of that kind of silly stuff. \nInitially, Applicant resisted consuming the mushrooms, but he eventually did and had a \nnegative experience. After returning home, he told his wife and mother what he had done, \nbut he did not notify his FSO when he returned to work. (Tr. 13, 22-24) \nIn December 2020, Applicant disclosed his drug use in his SCA during the course \nof his periodic reinvestigation. He also disclosed it when he was interviewed in February \n2021 by a Government investigator. Applicant\u2019s employer has never drug tested him, but \nhis employer could test him at any time. He understands that his company\u2019s policy is that \nemployees are not to use drugs.

He used marijuana a total of approximately ten times, and \nhe did not use it after he graduated from college in 2007. At the hearing, he admitted to \nusing cocaine two times the summer after he graduated from high school. He also used \nhallucinogenic mushrooms two to three times late in college. This behavior was not \nalleged and will not be considered as disqualifying conduct. He testified that he disclosed \nall of this illegal conduct in the first SCA he completed in 2010. (Tr. 28-32) \nSince Applicant\u2019s last use of illegal drugs in November 2020, he has avoided all \ncontact with his friend and ignored his calls, text messages, and emails. He has not given \nhis friend a reason for his lack of contact or for his behavior. Applicant\u2019s wife does not use \ndrugs, and they do not keep drugs in their home. (Tr. 25, 28-29, 33-34) \nApplicant provided documentation that on March 30, 2022, he received an email \nwith the contact information to make an appointment with a provider within his employee \nassistance\u2019s program. When he is able to make an appointment, he intends to \u201ctalk with \na counselor about [his] past errors in judgment after consulting with a friend about his \nexperience \u2026 .\u201d(AE A; Tr. 34-35) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant admitted he used hallucinogenic mushrooms once in October 2008 and \nagain in November 2020. He held a TS/SCI security clearance both times he chose to \nuse illegal drugs. Applicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence established the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe burden shifted to Applicant to prove mitigation of the resulting security \nconcerns. AG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \nAppellant\u2019s decision to use hallucinogenic mushrooms, an illegal drug, twice, while \nholding a TS/SCI security clearance, cannot be considered a minor lapse in judgment, \nbut rather a pattern of behavior that reflects his unwillingness to follow rules and \nregulations. Security clearance decisions are not limited to conduct during duty hours. \nOff-duty conduct, especially where it reflects poor judgment, provides a rational basis for \nthe government to question an appellant\u2019s security worthiness. (See, e.g., Cole v. Young, \n351 U.S. 536, 550 n.13 (1956); Croft v. Department of Air Force, 40 M.S.P.R. 320, 321 \nn.1 (1989)). Applicant\u2019s behavior showed a disregard for the law, regulations, and the \nfiduciary relationship he voluntarily entered into with the Government.  \nApplicant used marijuana, cocaine, and hallucinogenic mushrooms approximately \nfifteen to nineteen years ago. Once he started working for his current employer in 2008, \nhe discontinued all drug use, until he visited his college friend\u2019s family after the friend\u2019s \nfather died in October 2018. He used hallucinogenic mushrooms again with his friend in \nNovember 2020. He acknowledged that his employer has a policy against illegal drug \nuse, and he was subject to drug testing. \nApplicant credibly testified that he intends to no longer use illegal drugs; however, \nhe was in his mid-thirties, married, and had children when he resumed his use of illegal \ndrugs. All of his drug involvement occurred while he was working for his current employer \nand had held a security clearance for eight to ten years. Therefore, Applicant\u2019s assertions \nthat he has stopped using illegal drugs were insufficient to overcome the concerns with \nrespect to his past drug involvement. At this time, he did not demonstrate a lengthy \nenough pattern of abstinence, given the circumstances under which he chose to use \nillegal drugs. Applicant failed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-\nperson analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence, including his \nintent to seek counseling, his 2020 disclosure of his illegal use in his SCA and to the \nGovernment investigator, and his 2021 disclosure of his illegal drug use to his director. \nApplicant chose to use hallucinogenic mushrooms while working for his current \nemployer and holding a TS/SCI security clearance. He used illegal drugs while he was in \nhis mid-thirties, during marriage, and while he was a father. There has not been a \nsufficient passage of time to overcome the concerns with his drug involvement. I conclude \nApplicant has not met his burden of proof and persuasion. He did not mitigate the drug \ninvolvement or substance misuse security concerns or establish his eligibility to maintain \na security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

(Tr. 6-7, 29-30) She completed several post-graduate \nclasses; however, she has not received a master\u2019s degree. (Tr. 7) She has never served \nin the military. (Tr. 8) There is no evidence of security violations, arrests, convictions, use \nof illegal drugs, or abuse of alcohol. \nApplicant was married from 2016 to 2018, and she has custody of her five-year\u00ad\nold son. (Tr. 7-8) Her former husband lost his employment, and he was evicted from his \nresidence. (Tr. 26) She tried to financially assist her former husband.

(Tr. 22) She took some \nadditional college classes in 2014. (Tr. 30) She left her DOD-contractor employment \nbecause her husband wanted her to move. Next, she worked for an insurance company, \nand her pay was reduced about $20,000. (Tr. 22) She followed her employment with an \ninsurance company with work for a restaurant. (Tr. 23) \nIn 2016 to 2017, Applicant focused on saving money to pay off a single-wide mobile \nhome. (Tr. 36) In January 2019, she paid off her vehicle loan. (Tr. 39) She recently paid \nsome medical debts and paid off her single-wide mobile home. (Tr. 25, 41) In May 2021, \nshe sold the mobile home, and used $13,000 from the sale as a down payment to \npurchase some land and a house. Her mortgage was $91,000. (Tr. 38) She used about \n$20,000 to move a home on to the land she purchased and to make necessary repairs to \nthis home. (Tr. 45, 53) In September 2021, she moved into the home.

(Tr. 51) She did not timely pay her taxes because she \nowed money for her home repairs. (Tr. 52) \nStudent Loans \nAfter Applicant graduated from college in 2012, her student loans, which originated \nbefore 2013, were deferred for about one year. (Tr. 21, 30) Her student loans were a mix \nof federal-guaranteed loans and private loans. (Tr. 31) She considered student-loan \nconsolidation; however, she preferred to work with the loans on an individual basis. She \nrecognized that some of her payments were dispersed to all the loans. (Tr. 34; AE A; AE \nB) In May 2016, she began working for her current employer. (Tr. 23) She stopped making \npayments to her student loans around late 2016 or early 2017 because she was unable \nto work due to three of her hospitalizations for complications of pregnancy, and after her \nson was born, he had some medical problems.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d    \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is. well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. \nThe relevant financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as \nfollows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nApplicant has a history of negative financial information.

July 7, 2016) (citing \nISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act \nrequires removal of most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from \nthe first date of delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state \nstatute of limitations, whichever is longer. See Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade \nCommission website, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act Updates at Section 605, \nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. Debts may \nbe dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going \nto be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond to a credit reporting company\u2019s request for \ninformation, or when the debt has been charged off. Applicant contacted the creditor and \nasked for a payment plan. The student-loan creditor told her the three SOR debts were \ncharged off, and the creditor could not provide a payment plan. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

Feb. 17, 2017)). \nTwo Appeal Board decisions illustrate the analysis for applying AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and \n20(b) in cases where there are limited financial resources and circumstances beyond an \napplicant\u2019s control adversely affecting his or her finances. In ISCR Case No. 09-08533 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010), the applicant had $41,871 in delinquent credit-card debt and \ndefaulted on a home loan generating a $162,000 delinquent debt. Id. at 2. That applicant \nfiled for bankruptcy the same month the Administrative Judge issued her decision. Id. at \n1-2. The applicant in ISCR Case No. 09-08533 was recently divorced, had been \nunemployed for 10 months, and had childcare responsibilities. Her former husband was \ninconsistent in his child support payments to her. The Appeal Board determined that AG \n\u00b6 20(a) was \u201cclearly applicable (debt occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and [the debt] does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment)\u201d even though that applicant\u2019s debts were unresolved \nat the time the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision was issued. Id. at 3. The Appeal Board \nalso decided that the record evidence raised the applicability of AG \u00b6 20(b) because of \nthe absence of evidence of irresponsible behavior, poor judgment, unreliability, or lack of \ntrustworthiness. Id. at 4. I note that Applicant has the burden of proving the applicability \nof any mitigating conditions, and the burden to disprove a mitigating condition never shifts \nto the Government. \nSimilarly, in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) the Appeal Board \naddressed a situation where an applicant was sporadically unemployed and lacked the \nability to pay his creditors. The Appeal Board noted \u201cit will be a long time at best before \nhe has paid\u201d all of his creditors. Id. at 3. The applicant was living on unemployment \ncompensation at the time of his hearing. The Appeal Board explained that such a \ncircumstance was not necessarily a bar to having access to classified information stating: \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHowever, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required \nto be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or \nsimultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly given \nhis [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, \naccompanied by \u201cconcomitant conduct,\u201d that is, actions which evidence a \nserious intent to effectuate the plan.  \nISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) (citing ISCR Case No. 07-06482 \nat 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008)). The applicant in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 used his limited \nresources to (1) resolve some of his debts; (2) had a repayment plan for the remaining \ndebts; and (3) took \u201creasonable actions to effectuate that plan.\u201d Id. The Appeal Board \nremanded the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision because it did not \u201carticulate a satisfactory \nexplanation for his conclusions,\u201d emphasizing the Administrative Judge did \u201cnot explain \nwhat he believes that applicant could or should have done under the circumstances that \nhe has not already done to rectify his poor financial condition, or why the approach taken \nby applicant was not \u2018responsible\u2019 in light of his limited circumstances.\u201d Id.  \nApplicant experienced divorce, medical problems for herself, her father, and her \nson, underemployment, and her former spouse\u2019s failed to pay child support for their son. \nA fraction of the child support of $12,500 per year would have been enough to keep her \nstudent-loan accounts in current status. These are circumstances largely beyond her \ncontrol, which adversely affected her finances. However, \u201c[e]ven if applicant\u2019s financial \ndifficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his [or her] \ncontrol, the judge could still consider whether applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); \nISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \nApplicant presented some important mitigating information. Her credit reports \nreflect paid debts, debts with a zero balance, or debts in a current paid as agreed status. \nAll three SOR-alleged debts have been dropped from her credit reports. She paid several \nnon-SOR delinquent debts. Her single late filed tax return was an isolated occurrence. \nApplicant established mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d). She showed \ngood faith in her overall handling of her finances. I found her statement at her hearing to \nbe candid and credible. She promised to pay her debts and maintain her financial \nresponsibility. Her delinquent debts are unlikely to recur. There are clear indications her \nfinancial problems are under control. Her history of handling her finances does not cast \ndoubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Financial \nconsiderations security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 32-year-old senior scheduling manager and production control \nspecialist who has been employed by a DOD contractor for the previous six years. In \n2012, she received a bachelor\u2019s degree with a major in biology. She completed several \npost-graduate classes. She was married from 2016 to 2018, and she has custody of her \nfive-year-old son from that marriage. There is no evidence of security violations, arrests, \nconvictions, use of illegal drugs, or abuse of alcohol. \nApplicant has achieved significant pay raises for the last three years, which is an \nindication her employer is satisfied with her performance. In 2018, her pay was $60,000; \nin 2019, her pay was $69,000; in 2020, her pay was $78,000; and in 2021, her pay was \n$82,000. \nApplicant has a history of some negative financial information. She had delinquent \nmedical debts as recently as 2020, delinquent student-loan debts as recently as 2020, \nand currently owes federal income taxes of $800. She filed her 2020 federal income tax \nreturn in April 2022. \nThe overall record provides persuasive support for continued access to classified \ninformation. Her finances were harmed by several circumstances largely beyond her \ncontrol as discussed supra. She showed a track record of consistent payments to address \nmost of her debts. She acted responsibly under the circumstances, and all of her debts \nare now current or resolved. She understands that she needs to pay her debts, and the \nconduct required to retain her security clearance. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating: \n. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.

All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments \non all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a \ntime. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

Her efforts at debt resolution have established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d \nof debt re-payment. Security officials can check her credit reports and revoke her security \nclearance if she shows a lack of financial responsibility. I am confident she will resume \nher student-loan payments when the federal deferment ends, and she will maintain her \nfinancial responsibility. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations  \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history \nof not meeting financial obligations,\u201d relevant. Applicant has a history of not paying his \ndebts. Applicant AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are established. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 and considered \nthe following relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to his \nfinancial problems. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that \nhe acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has not provided \ndocumentation of his efforts to resolve any of his delinquent debts. There is no evidence \nthat he received any financial counseling. I find that Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are not applicable. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On November 24, 2021, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DODCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines G (Alcohol Consumption), \nJ (Criminal Conduct), and E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines, effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 2, 2021 (Item 2), and requested a \ndecision on the record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s written case on May 10, 2022. A complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was sent to Applicant, including documents identified as Items 1 \nthrough 5.

The case was assigned to me on August 9, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn her Answer to the SOR Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \nParagraphs 1.a., 1.c., and 2.b.~2.d. of the SOR, with explanations. She denied the \nfactual allegations in Paragraphs 1.b. and 3.b. Applicant failed to either admit or deny \nParagraphs 2.a. and 3.a. She also provided additional information to support her \nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is 35 years old, unmarried, and has a 14-year-old child. (Item 3 at \npages 7, and 26~27.) \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption, Guideline J: Criminal Conduct & Guideline E: \nPersonal Conduct \n1.a., 2.a., and 3.a. In October of 2016, Applicant admits that she was charged \nwith, and subsequently convicted of, Driving While Intoxicated (DWI). She was \nincarcerated for ten days, placed on probation for two years, and her license was \nrestricted for 12 months. Her restriction, in part, required the use of an Ignition Interlock \nSystem, of which Applicant claims she was unaware. This restriction is evidenced by \ncourt records. (Item 4 at page 2.) \n1.b., 2.a., and 3.a. About 11 months later, in September 2017, Applicant was \ncharged with and convicted of: Refusal of Breath Test \u2013 2nd Offense, Operating a \nVehicle on a Suspended or Revoked License, and Operating a Vehicle Without an \nIgnition Interlock System. (Item 4 at pages 7~16.) She was incarcerated for ten days, \nand placed on probation for three years. \n \n1.c., 2.a., and 3.a.

About a month after her Paragraph 1.c. allegation, noted above, in April of \n2018, Applicant admits she was charged and convicted of ASAP Non comply/Show \nCause (Operating a Vehicle Without an Ignition Interlock System). She was \nincarcerated for ten days, and placed on probation for two years. \n2.c.

See above discussion. \n3.b. In answer to \u201cSection 22- Police Record \u2013 In the last seven (7) years,\u201d \nApplicant answered \u201cNo,\u201d and failed to disclose any of her six convictions that occurred \nfrom 2016~2020. (Item 3 at page 33.) I find this to be a willful falsification. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. One condition may apply: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder. \nApplicant had three alcohol-related incidents between 2016 and 2018. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. One conditions may apply: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last alcohol-related conviction was more than four years ago. Alcohol \nConsumption is not the gravamen of Applicant\u2019s case; and as such, it is found for \nApplicant. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains five disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. One condition may apply, as discussed \nbelow: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \nApplicant has six convictions from 2016~2020. This evidence raises security \nconcerns under the above disqualifying condition, thereby shifting the burden to \nApplicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 32 contains two conditions that could mitigate criminal \nconduct security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nSufficient time has not passed since Applicant\u2019s most recent conviction, given the \nfact that she has five previous convictions. She was still on probation until six months \nafter the issuance of the SOR, and said probation only ended recently, about the time of \nthe issuance of the FORM. Criminal conduct is found against Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsification of his SCAs, the following \ndisqualifying condition applies under AG \u00b6 16: \n(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant denied intentionally falsifying her SCAs. When a falsification allegation \nis controverted, the Government has the burden of proving it. An omission, standing \nalone, does not prove falsification. An administrative judge must consider the record \nevidence as a whole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the \nomission.1 \nIn this instance, it is apparent from Applicant\u2019s comments that she was aware of \nher criminal record. She should have disclosed these facts to the Government. I find \n1  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubstantial evidence of an intent by Applicant to omit, conceal, or falsify facts from and \non her SCAs. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(a) is established. \nThe personal conduct security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by \nany of the following potentially applicable factors in AG \u00b6 17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAfter considering the mitigating conditions outlined above, none of them apply. \nApplicant did not make prompt or good-faith efforts to correct her falsifications or \nconcealments. While she discussed the falsifications with an investigator, she failed to \nestablish that her disclosure was prompt or in good-faith. She provided no information \nthat indicates she was ill-advised in completing her SCAs. (Item 5 at page 1.) Falsifying \ninformation is a serious offense, and Applicant has shown that similar lapses in \njudgment are likely to occur. Further, she failed to take responsibility for her actions. \nShe has not provided sufficient information in this record to demonstrate that she has \nmet her burden of proof for her personal conduct. Personal Conduct is found against \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from her Criminal Conduct, and Personal Conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a~2d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a. and 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n Guideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant filed for protection under Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2020, Chapter 7 in \n2014 and 2001. This is a legitimate means to resolve debts but not to avoid making any \nattempt to pay creditors. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nNone of these mitigating conditions apply to the three petitions for bankruptcy \nprotection. He supplied no evidence or explanation that this was beyond his control or \nthat it is unlikely to occur. The evidence in the record shows a pattern of Applicant \nhaving more debts that he could handle. The 2014 Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition \nincludes over $196,000 in delinquent accounts. \nApplicant has presented no evidence that he has any other means of managing \nhis finances and ensuring his financial security except for invoking the bankruptcy \noption. The record does not present Applicant as one who has the requisite good \njudgment and reliability needed for access to classified information. There is no \nevidence that he acted responsibly with his finances. There is nothing in the record to \nsupport a conclusion that Applicant made any good-faith efforts to pay or resolve his \ndebts before resorting to bankruptcy. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e. He denied the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 46 years old. He served in the military from 1994 to 1998 and was honorably discharged. He reenlisted in 2000 and was honorably discharged in the paygrade E-5 in January 2010. He experienced periods of unemployment from January 2010 to June 2011 and December 2011 to July 2013. He was attending school during this period. Applicant earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2015. He was also unemployed from January 2014 to February 2014 and from August 2017 to June 2018. He began working for his present employer, a federal contractor, in November 2018 until the present. His initial annual income was approximately $50,000 that has incrementally increased to approximately $70,000. (Transcript (Tr.) 17, 21-23, 25-26, 44-46; GE 1) Applicant married in 2001 and divorced in 2006. He has a 20-year-old child from the marriage. He has four other children from relationships, whose ages are 22, 18, 17 and 13. He does not have court orders for child support, but provides monthly payments of $300 for the 17-year-old and 13-year-old children. He also helps pay some college expenses for the 18-year-old. The other two children are adults and he does not provide financial support. (Tr. 18-22;",

DOHA received the hearing transcript on November 9, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e. He denied the SOR \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 46 years old. He served in the military from 1994 to 1998 and was \nhonorably discharged. He reenlisted in 2000 and was honorably discharged in the \npaygrade E-5 in January 2010. He experienced periods of unemployment from January \n2010 to June 2011 and December 2011 to July 2013. He was attending school during this \nperiod. Applicant earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2015. He was also unemployed from \nJanuary 2014 to February 2014 and from August 2017 to June 2018. He began working \nfor his present employer, a federal contractor, in November 2018 until the present. His \ninitial annual income was approximately $50,000 that has incrementally increased to \napproximately $70,000. (Transcript (Tr.) 17, 21-23, 25-26, 44-46; GE 1) \nApplicant married in 2001 and divorced in 2006. He has a 20-year-old child from \nthe marriage. He has four other children from relationships, whose ages are 22, 18, 17 \nand 13. He does not have court orders for child support, but provides monthly payments \nof $300 for the 17-year-old and 13-year-old children. He also helps pay some college \nexpenses for the 18-year-old. The other two children are adults and he does not provide \nfinancial support. (Tr. 18-22; GE 1) \nThe debts alleged in the SOR are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions, \ntestimony, and credit reports from April 2020, June 2021, and September 2022. (GE 1, 2, \n3, 4) \nApplicant attributed his financial issues to his unemployment. Since he began his \ncurrent job, he has had more financial stability. He testified that there were debts on his \ncredit report that he was unaware of and did not believe belonged to him. In 2018, he \ncontacted a debt relief company to address the negative information on his credit report \nand dispute it. The only debts he was aware he owed were his student loans. He did not \nmake payments on them from 2015, when he completed his degree, until 2019. Applicant \nadmitted that he made a mistake when he failed to begin timely repaying his student \nloans. He testified that in 2019, he contacted the creditor for his student loans and \nprovided a copy of his W-2 wage statement. At that time, he had not yet been working at \nhis present job for a full year, so the previous year\u2019s W-2 showed he earned about \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n$18,000. He arranged to pay $20 a month for six months to move the student loans out \nof their default status. He provided a document that shows that from August 2019 until \nMay 2020 he made 10 monthly payments. These consistent payments brought his \nstudent loans out of default status. He then contacted the creditor and was mailed a form \nto provide information to make a payment arrangement based on his current income at \nthe time. He anticipated his monthly payments would be about $300. However, before the \npayment plan started, the loans were place in a deferred status due to the COVID-19 \npandemic and moratorium on student loan payments. Applicant testified that when the \nmoratorium is lifted he would begin making monthly payments likely in January 2023. He \nhas also requested an application for the loan forgiveness program. (Tr. 24-37, 41, 48-\n54; AE B, C, D) \nThe SOR alleges two medical debts (\u00b6 1.c - $591 and \u00b6 1.d - $216). Applicant \ncredibly testified that he has medical insurance and is also covered by the Department of \nVeteran\u2019s Affairs (VA) for his medical services. He receives about $2,100 monthly in \ndisability payments that began in 2018. He disputes that he is responsible for these \nmedical debts. He said one is a hospital bill and he never went to the hospital. His children \nhave medical insurance under their mothers\u2019 insurance plans. Both debts are reported as \ncollection accounts on his June 2021 credit report. The last activity date on the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is November 2015 and for \u00b6 1.d the last activity date is September 2016. The \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.c is not reported on Applicant\u2019s most current credit report from September \n2022. Applicant testified that he spoke with the debt relief company that was disputing the \ndebts on his credit report about someone using his identity for medical services. He stated \nthat he uses the VA for all of his medical needs and did not incur medical expenses \noutside of the VA. (Tr. 39-41, 55-58) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($191) is a bill owed to a college that Applicant attended \nwhen he went back to school in 2019. He believed his college expenses were all covered \nby his GI Bill. He was unware he owed the bill and when he learned of it, he paid it. He \nprovided documentary proof that he resolved the debt. (Tr. 37-39; AE B) \nApplicant\u2019s current finances are stable. He has about $2,000 in savings and money \nin his pension plan. Each month after paying his expenses, he has about $2,800 \nremaining. He is confident that when the student loan payment plan begins, he will be \nable to make the required monthly payments. He has no other debts. He admitted he \nmade a mistake by not addressing his student loans when they became due, but he is \nback on track. (Tr. 43, 47, 59-60) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had delinquent student loans and other debts that he failed to pay. There \nis sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nApplicant acknowledged that he did not timely address his student loans after he \ncompleted college. He had periods of unemployment that affected his ability to make \npayments. This was a condition beyond his control. In August 2019, before receiving the \nSOR, he began addressing his student loans and participated in a rehabilitation program. \nHe completed the program and was to begin an income-based payment program when \nhis student loans were placed in a deferred status due to the COVID-19 pandemic \nmoratorium. Although delayed, Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \n\u00b6 20(b) applies. \nApplicant was unaware he owed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e because he thought it was \ncovered by the GI Bill. He has paid it. He is now in a stable job, saving money, and is \npoised to begin repaying his student loans when the moratorium is over. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problem are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) apply. There is no evidence \nApplicant has participated in financial counseling, but there are clear indications that his \nproblems are resolved and under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. \nApplicant disputed the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. He credibly \ntestified that he received all of his medical treatment through the VA and these debts do \nnot belong to him. SOR \u00b6 1.c is no longer on his most recent credit report. He has not \nprovided other documentary evidence to support that these debts do not belong to him. I \nbelieve due to the small amount of the debts that if they did belong to him, he would pay \nthem. I also find that these debts do not rise to the level of creating a security concern. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) partially applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with \nno questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nI conclude Applicant successfully mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline \nF, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges that, as of June 29, 2021, Applicant owed charged-off debts of $3,110 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); $15,894 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); $29,951 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and $23,545 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Additionally, the SOR alleges that Applicant owed collection debts of $1,770 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $42,233 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted the alleged debts but stated that he had sold his home and paid them off. (Item 1.) After considering Items 1 through 9, and Applicant\u2019s exhibits A through C, I make the following findings of fact: 3 Applicant is 54 years old and twice divorced. He was married to his first wife from December 1989 to July 1999 and to his second wife from December 2006 to January 2022. He has one daughter, age 17, from his second marriage. (Item 2; AE A.) Applicant served honorably on active duty in the United States military from June 1987 to April 1997. He was granted a DOD security clearance for his military duties and retained clearance eligibility throughout his career. (Item 3.) On his discharge from the military, he became employed by a defense contractor as a site manager. Over the next 17 years, he worked at various remote field sites overseas. He has been with his current employer, also a defense contractor, since September 2014. (Item 2.) He has no education beyond his general education diploma (GED). (Item 3.)

The SOR \nexplained why the DCSA CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DCSA CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations on September 17, 2021, and requested \na decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing before an administrative judge from the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On January 5, 2022, the Government \nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of a statement of the \nGovernment\u2019s position and nine documents pre-marked as Item 1 through Item 9. The \nSOR and Applicant\u2019s SOR response were included as Item 1. On January 7, 2022, DOHA \nforwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed him that any response was due \nwithin 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on January 18, 2022. Applicant \nresponded to the FORM on January 26, 2022, and February 3, 2022. \nOn March 18, 2022, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant. I received the case file and assignment on March 28, 2022. Applicant\u2019s \nFORM response was entered into evidence without any objections as an Applicant exhibit \n(AE A.) On April 12, 2022, I sua sponte reopened the record for additional documentation \nfrom Applicant to corroborate his assertion that the debts at issue in the SOR have been \npaid. Applicant forwarded documents on April 12, 2022, which were accepted into the \nrecord without objection as AE B and AE C. \nEvidentiary Rulings \nDepartment Counsel submitted as Item 3 in the FORM a summary report of a \npersonal subject interview (PSI) of Applicant conducted on October 19, 2020, by an \nauthorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The summary \nreport of the PSI was included in a DOD report of investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, a DOD personal background ROI may be received in \nevidence and considered with an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible \nunder the Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary report did not bear the authentication \nrequired for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the DOHA Appeal Board \nheld that it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of a \nPSI where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her opportunity to object to \nconsideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, Applicant\u2019s \nattention was directed to the following notice regarding Item 3: \nAlso, please note that the attached summary of your Personal Subject \nInterview (PSI) \u2014 is being provided to the Administrative Judge for \nconsideration as part of the record evidence in this case.

Alternatively, you can \nobject on the ground that the report is unauthenticated by a Government \nwitness. If no objections are raised in your response to this FORM, or if you \ndo not respond to the FORM, or if you do not respond to the FORM, the \nAdministrative Judge may determine that you have waived any objections to \nthe admissibility of the summary and may consider the summary as evidence \nin your case. \nConcerning whether Applicant understood the meaning of authentication or the legal \nconsequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process rights \nor protections beyond those afforded if he was represented by legal counsel. Pro se \napplicants are not expected to act like lawyers, but they are expected to take timely and \nreasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive. See ISCR Case No. 12-10810 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). See also ADP Case No. 17-03252 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2018) \n(holding that it was reasonable for the administrative judge to conclude that any objection \nhad been waived by an applicant\u2019s failure to object after being notified of the right to \nobject). \nApplicant was advised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that he may request a hearing. In \n\u00b6 E3.1.15, he was advised that he is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, \nor mitigate facts admitted by him or proven by Department Counsel and that he has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the \nDirective does not specifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, \nApplicant was placed on sufficient notice of his opportunity to object to the admissibility of \nthe interview summary report, to comment on the interview summary, and to make any \ncorrections, deletions, or updates to the information in the report. Applicant did not raise \nany objections to the PSI in his response to the FORM. \nGovernment officials are entitled to a presumption of regularity in the discharge of \ntheir official responsibilities. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07539 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2018). \nApplicant can reasonably be held to have read the PSI summary in Item 3, and there is no \nevidence that he failed to understand his obligation to file any objections to the summary if \nhe did not want the administrative judge to consider it. Accordingly, I find that Applicant \nwaived any objections to the PSI summary. Items 1 through 9 are accepted as evidentiary \nexhibits subject to issues of relevance and materiality in light of the entire record. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges that, as of June 29, 2021, Applicant owed charged-off debts of \n$3,110 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); $15,894 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); $29,951 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and $23,545 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). \nAdditionally, the SOR alleges that Applicant owed collection debts of $1,770 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nand $42,233 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted the alleged \ndebts but stated that he had sold his home and paid them off.

He was married to his first wife from \nDecember 1989 to July 1999 and to his second wife from December 2006 to January \n2022. He has one daughter, age 17, from his second marriage. (Item 2; AE A.) \nApplicant served honorably on active duty in the United States military from June \n1987 to April 1997. He was granted a DOD security clearance for his military duties and \nretained clearance eligibility throughout his career. (Item 3.) On his discharge from the \nmilitary, he became employed by a defense contractor as a site manager. Over the next 17 \nyears, he worked at various remote field sites overseas. He has been with his current \nemployer, also a defense contractor, since September 2014. (Item 2.) He has no education \nbeyond his general education diploma (GED). (Item 3.) \nShortly after returning to the United States in September 2014 for his current job, \nApplicant purchased a home in October 2014. He obtained a mortgage solely in his name \nfor $459,675. In February 2017, that loan was paid off, likely through a refinancing, as he \ntook on a mortgage of $485,510 with another lender at that time. The monthly payments on \nthat mortgage loan were $2,899. (Item 4.) In May 2016, Applicant was granted a top secret \nsecurity clearance. (Items 8, 9.) \nIn May 2017, Applicant and his second wife separated. In June 2020, they entered \ninto a formal separation agreement under which Applicant agreed to pay his now ex-wife \n$1,000 per month for 120 months. Applicant was given exclusive use and possession of \ntheir marital residence, which was deeded in his name. He also assumed sole legal and \nphysical custody of their daughter and agreed to cooperate with his ex-wife on all matters \nconcerning their daughter. He was responsible for all outstanding credit-card debts in his \nname and on those credit-card debts listed in his spouse\u2019s name as of the date of their \nseparation agreement, but not for any debts incurred by her subsequent to the agreement. \n(Item 3.) \nIn February 2020, Applicant\u2019s employer was informed that the DOD Continuous \nEvaluation Program developed unreported information that Applicant was delinquent on \nthree accounts totaling $57,523. (Item 8.) On April 4, 2020, Applicant completed and \ncertified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In \nresponse to SF 86 inquiries into his financial record, Applicant stated that he was working \nwith a bankruptcy lawyer to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition as he had a hard time \npaying all his bills in the past year and a half. Regarding any delinquency involving routine \naccounts, Applicant listed one debt \u2014 a debt consolidation loan for $42,233 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \u2014 \nthat he planned to include in a bankruptcy filing. (Item 2.) \nAs of June 17, 2020, Applicant was making his mortgage payment according to \nterms, although his account had been 30 days past due in February 2020 and March 2020. \nHis credit report showed that the $42,233 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c, account opened June 2016) \nwas placed for collection in October 2018. Additionally, a credit union had charged off \ncredit-card balances of $29,951 in April 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.e, account opened July 2002) and \n$15,894 in May 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.d, account opened April 2009).

Credit-card debts of $3,110 (SOR \u00b6 1.b, account opened \nSeptember 2017) and $12,180 (not alleged, account opened August 2006) were charged \noff in December 2018 and January 2019, respectively. (Item 4.) In July 2020, a fast cash \nlender placed a $1,770 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a) for collection. (Item 5.) \nWhen asked during his October 2020 PSI about the finances, Applicant stated that \nhe was in the process of filing for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy so that could consolidate his \ndebts totaling between $120,000 and $130,000. He explained that his second wife had bad \nspending habits, opened multiple credit-card accounts without his knowledge, and ran up \nbalances that she did not pay. He stated that he obtained a loan from a credit union to pay \noff some of his second wife\u2019s debts, although when confronted about the adverse \ninformation on his credit report, he stated that the loan in SOR \u00b6 1.c (which was not \nobtained from the credit union) was that debt. He asserted that his then spouse opened up \nnew credit-card accounts and ran up more debt. When he could not get his mounting debt \nunder control, he obtained legal counsel to file for bankruptcy. \nWhen confronted with the delinquencies on his credit report by the investigator, \nApplicant stated that the $3,110 credit-card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) was paid. He expressed his \nbelief that the charged-off balances in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.f were on credit cards used by \nhis second wife, but added that he may also have used the credit cards to pay some bills. \n(Item 3.) He asserted that the $12,180 charged-off credit-card debt (not alleged) was also a \ndebt incurred by his second wife, and that she opened most of the credit-card accounts \nwithout his knowledge. However, he had accepted repayment responsibility for all of the \ndebts. (Item 3.) \nDuring his PSI, Applicant reported annual gross income from his employment of \n$197,000 while his spouse\u2019s income was inconsistent. He estimated her earnings at \n$30,000 in 2019. He related that in addition to spousal support at $1,000 a month, he had \nmonthly expenses totaling $7,390, which left him discretionary income of $3,214 per \nmonth. He stated that he was living within his means and was willing and able to pay his \ndebts. (Item 3.) \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports show that all of the SOR debts as well as the $12,180 \nunalleged delinquency were opened as individual accounts in his name. (Items 4-6.) He did \nnot explain how his spouse could have opened accounts in his name and run up balances \nwithout his knowledge. \nOn October 26, 2020, Applicant was re-contacted by the OPM investigator. He \nexplained that his separation agreement with his second wife, which was executed in June \n2020, was not filed with the court until late October 2020. He explained that he had not \nfiled for bankruptcy as he had been advised to wait until his divorce was final to ensure that \nhis ex-wife was not included in his bankruptcy. (Item 3.) In December 2020, a default \njudgment was granted against Applicant for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Court records reflect \nthat Applicant had been served with the complaint on November 3, 2020.

It is unclear whether an incident report was filed with the DCSA CAF. \nIn October 2020, Applicant paid off in a lump sum the $5,022 balance on a $39,430 \ncar loan obtained in June 2015.

It is \nunclear whether Applicant knew about the judgment debt at that time. The $12,180 \ncharged-off debt (unalleged) was paid off in May 2021. Applicant was making timely \npayments on a credit-card account opened in May 2019 which had a $1,146 balance, and \non an automobile loan obtained for $32,629 in October 2015. The balance of the \nautomobile loan was $2,027 after his June 2021 payment. He was making timely payments \nof $2,421 per month on his mortgage. (Item 5.) \nApplicant asserted on September 17, 2021, that he sold his house, and with the \nproceeds paid off all of the debts alleged in the SOR. (Item 1.) A check of his credit on \nJanuary 5, 2022, reflected no progress toward resolving the $3,110 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a). \nHowever, his credit report showed that his mortgage loan was paid off in August 2021, and \nthat the $15,894 charged-off credit-card balance (SOR \u00b6 1.d) was settled for less than its \nfull balance at that time. The $23,545 unsecured loan delinquency (SOR \u00b6 1.f) and \n$29,951 credit-card delinquency (SOR \u00b6 1.e) were settled for less than their full balances in \nOctober 2021. The consolidation loan in SOR \u00b6 1.c was listed as having a zero balance \nafter charge off. His credit report reflected zero payments on that account since September \n2018. (Item 6.) \nOn January 26, 2022, Applicant asserted in response to the FORM that he had \nsettled and paid all his debts at issue with the proceeds from selling his house in lieu of a \nChapter 13 bankruptcy filing. He added that he was able to obtain a mortgage on a new \nhome for him and his daughter; that he had no other outstanding debt obligations; and that \nwith the finalization of their divorce, his second wife no longer had access to any of his \naccounts. (Item 1.) \nThe final order of divorce, entered in late January 2022, indicates that Applicant\u2019s \nex-wife was not required to pay child support for their daughter. The terms of their \nseparation agreement were incorporated within the divorce decree. Accordingly, Applicant \nis obligated to continue paying spousal support to his ex-wife of $1,000 a month until June \n2030. (AE A.) \nApplicant\u2019s current credit report shows that he bought a new home in January 2022, \ntaking on a mortgage obligation of $352,240 with repayment at $1,909 per month. He \nobtained an automobile loan of $22,756 in late February 2022, to be repaid at $410 per \nmonth. He also opened a new cellphone account in March 2022, incurring a $230 debt. \nWith the intention of rebuilding his credit, Applicant opened a credit-card account in \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 2021 with a $1,000 credit limit and a credit-card account in March 2022 with a \n$3,000 limit. Those accounts had zero balances as of April 2022. (AEs B, C.) The debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a was no longer on his credit report. The credit-card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b was \nreported as having been settled for less than its full balance in January 2022. The debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.c was on his current credit report as having a zero balance, but with no indication \nof any payments since the October 2018 charge off. (AE B.) Applicant completed a \nhomeownership education course in December 2021 as well as a financial management \ncourse. (AE C.) \nApplicant indicated in response to the FORM that he did not intend to be in debt or \nuse credit in the future unless he must. He regards dealing with the financial issues as a \n\u201clife changing event for [him] that resulted in a long divorce battle with [his] ex-wife so [he] \ncould change [his] life and take care of [his] daughter and provide for her better.\u201d (AE B.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing\nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative\njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also  EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual does not pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. Applicant admits that the six accounts in the SOR \nbecame seriously delinquent and were charged off or placed for collection. He attributes \nhis financial problems to his second wife, having stated during his PSI that she incurred \nmost of the debt without his knowledge. Available credit reports in evidence indicate the six \naccounts in the SOR, including the credit-card accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e), were \nopened as individual accounts, so he was solely legally liable for repayment. He provided \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nno proof that his ex-wife opened the credit-card accounts or took on loans in his name \nwithout his authorization. It was his responsibility to monitor the use of his credit cards, and \npay for credit extended on his accounts. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations,\u201d applies. The evidence for \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts,\u201d is less clear. Applicant indicated during his PSI that he had $3,214 in discretionary \nincome each month. Presumably, he could have used some of those funds to make \npayments directly to one or more of his SOR creditors and perhaps avoided collection on \none or more of the SOR accounts, such as the $1,770 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a was placed for \ncollection in July 2020. \nApplicant has the burdens of production and persuasion in establishing sufficient \nmitigation to overcome the financial concerns raised by his loan and credit-card defaults. \nOne or more of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply in whole or in part: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(a), Applicant had more than $116,000 in consumer-credit debts \ngo into default between October 2018 and July 2020. His record of delinquency is too \nrecent to conclude that it happened so long ago to not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some applicability. Applicant did not \nprove that his ex-wife incurred the SOR debts without his knowledge. However, he and his \nsecond wife began living apart in May 2017. In June 2020, he took responsibility for \nrepaying not only his debts, but also her debts incurred before their formal separation. He \nagreed to per her $1,000 a month in spousal support for the next ten years. \nYet Applicant did not demonstrate financial responsibility in some aspects. \nAssuming that his second wife incurred significant debt in her name during their marriage \nthat he had to repay, he handled some of his loans irresponsibly. He obtained the loan in \nSOR \u00b6 1.f in June 2017, when he and his second wife were no longer cohabiting. The loan \nwas charged off around June 2020.The creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c obtained a default judgment \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nagainst him in December 2020. He was served with notice on November 3, 2020, and then \napparently elected to not appear in court. He listed the debt on his April 2020 SF 86 and \nindicated that he planned to include it in a bankruptcy filing, so he clearly knew about that \n$42,233 delinquency. A component of financial responsibility is keeping one\u2019s creditors \ninformed and attempting to resolve debts. As previously discussed, his income was \nsufficient to make some debt payments, and there is no evidence that he tried to negotiate \nrepayment terms with his creditors or informed them of his intention to file a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy petition once his divorce was final.  \nAG 20(c) is partially established in that Applicant settled the debts owed the credit \nunion: the credit-card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d in August 2021, and the credit-card and loan debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f in October 2021, apparently with some of the proceeds from the sale \nof his marital home. The credit-card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b was settled for less than its full \nbalance in January 2022. The record is unclear as to the amounts paid to settle those \naccounts, but they are no longer a source of financial pressure for Applicant. \nApplicant asserts that his April 2022 credit report (AE B) establishes that all of the \nSOR debts have been either settled under terms acceptable to his creditors or paid in full. \nThe $1,770 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a was no longer on his credit report. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c \nwas on his credit report as having a zero balance, but as a transferred or sold charged-off \ndebt. Date of last payment reported is May 2018. The fact that a debt has dropped off a \ncredit report is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution. See ISCR Case No. 14-05803 \nat 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, \n2015)). Debts may be dropped from a credit report when creditors believe the debt is not \ngoing to be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond to a credit reporting company\u2019s request \nfor information, a debt has been charged off, or for another reason. His credit report does \nnot prove that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c have been resolved, although I note that \nApplicant was able to obtain a new mortgage of $352,240 in January 2022 and a car loan \nof $22,756 in late February 2022, so the $42,233 charge-off did not prevent him from \nobtaining new credit in significant amounts. \nAs for his delay in resolving his known debts, Applicant explained that he was told to \nwait for his divorce to be final to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. Before his divorce \nwas final, he elected instead to sell his marital home because it was a faster way to resolve \nhis financial issues. Information of record about his mortgage loans shows he sold the \nhouse in August 2021 and settled the $15,894 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d at that time. In October \n2021, the credit union accepted less than the full balances for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and \n1.f, so those accounts were resolved under terms favorable to Applicant. The $3,110 \ncredit-card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b went unpaid until January 2022. Applicant did not provide an \nexplanation for the delay in debt resolution. There is no evidence showing that the default \njudgment for the $42,233 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) has been satisfied. AG \u00b6 20(c) has not been \nshown to apply to the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. \nApplicant exhibited some good faith under AG \u00b6 20(d) with respect to the debts that \nhave been settled. He obtained financial counseling at the advice of an attorney. While that \nevidence is viewed favorably, I remain concerned about his financial judgment, given the \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrecency of his financial problems and the extent to which his finances were out of control. \nHe had a sizeable mortgage obligation in recent years ($459,675 loan in October 2014, \n$485,510 loan in February 2017, and $461,579 loan in December 2020). In June 2015, he \nobtained a vehicle loan for $39,430 that he paid off with a $5,022 payment in October 2020 \nwhile other debts were delinquent, such as the $1,770 cash loan that went to collection in \nJuly 2020. \nApplicant indicated in response to the FORM that he had to file for divorce so that \nhe could better care for his daughter, and that he was on track toward a simpler life. In that \nregard, he purchased a new home and a small commuter car for work. His April 2022 credit \nreport shows that, in January 2022, he took on a mortgage of $352,240, to be repaid at \n$1,909 per month. In February 2022, he obtained a car loan for $22,971, to be repaid at \n$404 per month. It is unclear what happened to the vehicle that he paid off with a lump-\nsum payment of $5,022 in October 2020. That being said, Applicant has reduced his \nexpenses. Yet he lacks proof that the default judgment for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c has been \npaid, and lacks a recent track record of timely payments to ensure that he can manage his \nfinances responsibly going forward. The financial considerations security concerns are not \nsufficiently mitigated at this time. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some \nof the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \nThe security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an \napplicant\u2019s personal debts. It is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness with regard to his fitness or suitability to handle classified \ninformation appropriately. See ISCR Case No. 09-92160 at 5 (App. Bd. June 21, 2010). I \ndo not doubt that Applicant\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s spending habits causes significant issues for \nApplicant. At the same time, he did not show sound financial judgment in taking control of \nthe issue. He allowed his accounts totaling more than $116,000 to go into default. He \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n_____________________ \ndemonstrated serious financial irresponsibility, which is inconsistent with the judgment \nexpected of someone holding a top secret clearance. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Perhaps at some \nfuture date, Applicant will be able to show a track record of timely adherence to his \nfinancial obligations sufficient to warrant a favorable adjudication. Based on the evidence \nof record, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or \ncontinue security clearance eligibility for Applicant at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice \nof Video Teleconference Hearing on March 30, 2022. The case was heard as scheduled \non April 25, 2022. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf. She presented no \ndocuments at the hearing. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on May 17, 2022. \n(Tr. at 10-14.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 32 years old and single. She graduated from high school in 2007 and \ntook some college courses in 2009 and 2010 and again in 2012 and 2013, but she has \nnot yet earned a degree.

Due to the passage of time, Applicant was unable to explain at the hearing why \nshe failed to file tax returns for the four years in question. Applicant was able to locate the \ndocumentation she needed to file for TY 2014. In early 2022 she mailed her Federal and \nstate tax returns for that year. She owed no additional taxes for TY 2014.

She \nis currently paying past-due state taxes pursuant to a recent voluntary payment plan she \nnegotiated, which provides for the automatic withdrawal of $100 from her biweekly \npaychecks. She is uncertain what tax year is being paid under this plan. The state tax \ndebt is about $500. She has timely filed all of her returns for TYs after 2015 and has an \nextension to file her TY 2021 returns. (Tr. at 17-22.) \nWith respect to TY 2010, 2011, and 2013, Applicant has been unable to reach an \nIRS employee to obtain the needed information for the prior years. The IRS phone \nmessage states that tax information is only available for TYs 2018 and later. She has \nconsidered seeking help from the tax professional who prepared her most recent returns, \nbut has not yet done so. She noted that she was a full-time student in 2009 and 2010 and \nhad no income. (Tr. at 17-24.) \n1.c. Collection debt in the amount of about $315. This debt is for a payday loan \naccount that Applicant opened in 2017 or 2018 and could not repay. Before she applied \nfor a security clearance, she contacted this creditor and tried to resolve the debt with a \npayment plan. The collection agency refused and demanded full payment. Since then she \nhas not repaid this loan. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 24, 26-27.) \n1.d. Collection debt in the amount of about $377. This debt is owed for internet \nservices and unreturned equipment. Applicant could not pay the original creditor in about \n2016 or 2017. The collection agency for the creditor demanded full payment of the debt, \nwhich Applicant could not pay. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 27-28.) \n1.e. Collection debt in the amount of about $172. This debt is also owed for internet \nservices and unreturned equipment. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 28-30.) \n1.f. Collection debt in the amount of about $178. Applicant testified that this \naccount is with the same creditor and the same collection agency as the debt in SOR 1.e, \nbut it is not a duplicate of SOR 1.e. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 30-31.) \n1.g Delinquent medical debt in the amount of $1,168. This debt is for emergency \nroom medical services in 2017 or 2018. Applicant\u2019s insurance company paid its share of \nthe bill, and the unpaid balance is Applicant\u2019s share of the bill. The creditor refused to \naccept partial payments pursuant to a payment plan. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 31-\n32.) \n1.h Delinquent medical debt in the amount of $2,044. This debt is for medical \nservices. Applicant is unsure what services are covered by this bill. Applicant has not paid \nthis debt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 32.) \n1.i.

This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at \n33.) \n1.k Student loan debt in the amount of about $4,770 placed for collection. Applicant \ninitially tried to repay this student loan with small payments, but was unable to continue \npaying it. She has not tried to rehabilitate the student loan and begin paying on normal \npayment terms. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 34, 42.) \n1.l Student loan debt in the amount of about $8,101 placed for collection. The \ncurrent status of this debt is the same as the debt in SOR 1.k. This debt is not resolved. \n(Tr. at 34.) \nGovernment Exhibit 3, the most recent credit report in the record, lists three \nadditional delinquent debts. One is a credit-card debt in the amount of $578. This account \nwas opened in 2019 and was sold to a collection agency in November 2021. The second \ndebt is also for a credit-card account that was opened by Applicant\u2019s mother under \nApplicant\u2019s name. The amount of the delinquent debt is $658. Her mother has agreed to \nrepay this debt. Applicant is also delinquent on her car loan. She is paying that delinquent \ndebt and has retained possession of the car. (Tr. at 34-38; GE 3 at 4-6.) \nMitigation \nApplicant admitted that she was irresponsible with her credit when she was young. \nShe would take out loans to pay debts and then be unable to repay the loans. Applicant \ntestified about her plan to pay the debts she believes she owes. She recently received a \npromotion and a pay raise and has just begun working at a second job that permits her \nto work flexible part-time hours. She now has the additional income to begin paying her \ndebts and repairing her credit in the future. (Tr. at 25-26.) \nApplicant has not sought financial counseling though her mother has encouraged \nher to talk to a counselor at Applicant\u2019s bank. After she pays her monthly living expenses, \nshe has little or no money left over. She expects to make a gross amount of about $600 \nper week working at her second job and intends to use that money to begin paying down \nher debts. She hopes to pay off her debts by the end of 2022, with the exception of her \nstudent loans, which are too large to repay without a payment schedule.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nAs of the date the SOR was issued, Applicant owed approximately $15,600 for ten \npast-due debts, including two delinquent student loans. She also failed to file her Federal \nand state tax returns for four years, the most recent of which was TY 2014. These facts \nestablish prima facie evidence for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the \nburden to Applicant to mitigate those security concerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nOverall, Applicant has not established any of the above mitigating conditions. Her \nplans for the future may help her begin to pay her debts, but until she has established a \ntrack record of earning additional income through her new second job and begun paying \nher debts, it is too soon to apply any of the above mitigating conditions. She partially \nmitigated her tax filing delinquency, but she also disclosed at the hearing that she has \ntwo previously undisclosed tax debts. \nIn support of this conclusion, I cite the Appeal Board\u2019s decision in ISCR Case No.\n07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) for the proposition that the adjudicative guidelines \ndo not require that an applicant be debt-free, but that more than a plan is required. The \nBoard\u2019s guidance for adjudications in cases such as this is the following: \n \n. . . an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has \npaid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is \nno requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts \nsimultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may \nprovide for the payments of such debts one at a time. ISCR Case No. 07-\n06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation marks \nomitted).  \nGiven her available resources, Applicant has developed a pragmatic approach to \nthe repayment of her past-due debts. She has not shown, however, that her current \nfinancial status is stable. She has recently incurred additional delinquent commercial and \ntax debts that also need to be repaid. Moreover, she has not taken significant actions to \nimplement her plan and to determine how she will file her back tax returns and rehabilitate \nher delinquent student loans.

The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the security concerns raised by her financial situation. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for \nnational security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

At the end of the hearing, I left the record open at the request \nof Applicant\u2019s counsel to allow her to submit documents.

The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 12, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 53-year-old married woman. She has been legally separated from her \nhusband since 2017. (AE A) A previous marriage ended in divorce. She earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in business accounting in 2001, and she earned a master\u2019s degree in \ninformation systems management in 2005. (Tr. 23-24) Since earning her master\u2019s degree, \nshe has worked for various contractors as an information technology security subject-\nmatter expert. (Tr. 27). She has been with her current employer for the last three years. \nApplicant is a veteran of the U.S. Army National Guard, where she served from 1989 to \n2001. She was discharged honorably. (Tr. 21) \nApplicant is highly respected in the community and on the job. One friend described \nher as a person with a steadfast character and resolute demeanor. (AE B) Other friends \ncharacterize her as hard working (AE E), responsible, and honest. (AE G) Per her \nsupervisor, she \u201cis one of the most dedicated, hardworking, and innovative people with \nwhom [he has] had the pleasure to work.\u201d (AE H)  \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. They began in the mid-2010s when \nher marriage began to deteriorate. By the time the government initiated the background \ninvestigation in January 2021, she had incurred approximately $35,000 of delinquent debt, \nas alleged in the SOR. (GE 3) \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.a, totaling approximately $15,800, was initially \nowed to a credit card lender. It was subsequently transferred to a collection agent. \nApplicant clarified her SOR answer, testifying that she agreed that the debt was delinquent, \nbut contested the amount overdue (Tr. 39).  Applicant contacted the creditor, but was \nunable to settle the account because they requested a lump-sum which she was unable to \nafford. (Tr. 40-41) After the issuance of the SOR, she retained an attorney to help her \nsettle this account, as well as her other debts. (Tr. 41-42) She provided no evidence of any \nprogress made thus far. \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.b, totaling approximately $7,400, is another \ncredit card balance. She contacted the credit card company, and was told the debt had \nbeen transferred to another lender. (Tr. 44) When she contacted the new debt holder, they \nproposed a payment plan that she could not afford.

(Tr. 52) She recently \ncontacted the creditor to arrange a payment plan. (Tr. 51) \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.e, totaling $96, is owed to a cable television \ncompany, allegedly for the balance on an account that had been closed. (Tr. 52, 54) \nApplicant contends that she \u201cmust have provided them with something\u201d because they \nclosed the account after their conversation. (Tr. 52-53) Applicant has no documentation \nthat the account was closed. (Tr. 53) \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.f, totaling $277 is a gas station credit card. \nApplicant contends that she satisfied this debt through an electronic payment. (Tr. 55) It is \nlisted as settled on a credit bureau report of February 2021. (GE 3 at 4) \nApplicant contends that she satisfied multiple other delinquent debts, as her \nfinancial situation gradually stabilized after her legal separation. (Tr. 17, 41) She did not \nelaborate, nor provide any documentation. Also, she contends that the amounts owed to \nthe creditors alleged in the SOR are lower the Government alleged. In addition, she \ncontends that she lost many of her financial records when she relocated from the home \nshe shared with her husband. \nIn August 2019, Applicant went on a two-week vacation to Europe, visiting three \ncountries. (Tr. 71; GE 1 at 47-49) The trip cost approximately $2,400. (Tr. 72) \nIn 2021, Applicant\u2019s mother passed away. (Tr. 92) Applicant exhausted her savings, \ntotaling approximately $9,000, on burial expenses. (Tr. 19) She contends that the money \nshe had to spend on her mother\u2019s interment impeded her ability to make better progress \nresolving her delinquent debts. (Tr. 91) \nApplicant earns $182,000 annually. (Tr. 33) She has been earning more than \n$100,000 per year since 2016. (Tr. 33) Applicant maintains a budget. (Tr. 85; AE J) She \nhas $1,000 of discretionary income remaining at the end of each month. She testified that \nshe is using her discretionary income to make extra payments on her bills. (Tr. 85) She \nprovided no evidence supporting this contention. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant satisfied the debt\n \n alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.f. I resolve it in her favor. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe remaining delinquent debt, totaling approximately $35,000, triggers the \napplication of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling s ervice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are still outstanding. Consequently, AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \nThe period when Applicant incurred delinquent debt corresponded with the \ndeterioration of her marriage and her ultimate separation from her husband. Her ability to \nsatisfy them after they became delinquent was hampered by the costs she incurred after \nher mother passed away in 2021. Conversely, since Applicant\u2019s marital separation, she has \ntaken an overseas vacation to three countries. Moreover, she provided minimal evidence \nsubstantiating her contention that she has satisfied or begun satisfying the SOR debts. \nSimilarly, her contention that she has satisfied debts that are unalleged in the SOR is not \nsupported by the record evidence. Under these circumstances, I am unable to conclude \nthat AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. \nAlthough Applicant now maintains a budget, it is unclear how long she has been \nadhering to it because she did not submit it until after I extended the record. Absent \nsupporting evidence that she is adhering to a budget and paying down her debt, it remains \nunclear whether her financial problems are under control. Under these circumstances, \nnone of the other mitigating conditions apply, and I conclude that Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the whole-person concept in my analysis of the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions and it does not warrant a favorable conclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

He is single and has no children. He has been \nemployed as an engineering technician since December 2019. He reports no military \nservice. (Item 3) This is his first request for a security clearance. He completed his \nsecurity clearance application (SCA) on December 20, 2019. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline H that Applicant used cocaine at least four \ntimes from March 2018 to March 2020; used marijuana with varying frequency from \nJune 2006 to March 2020; purchased marijuana with varying frequency from 2011 to \nMarch 2020. (SOR 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c) The SOR also alleged that in July 2019 Applicant \ntested positive for THC and was terminated from his employment (SOR 1.d); that he \nmisused the prescription medication Norco from about April 2019 to December 2019 \n(SOR 1.e); and that he used LSD approximately three times from 2013 to 2014. (1.f) \n(Item1) \nThe SOR also cross-alleged under Guideline E, the SOR items 1.a through 1.f \nunder Guideline H and that Applicant intentionally falsified material facts on his \nDecember 20, 2019 SCA in Section 23, by not disclosing the drug use that occurred in \nthe last seven years; that he was involved in the illegal purchase of any drug or \ncontrolled substance; and intentionally engaged in the misuse of prescription drugs \nwithin the last seven years. (SOR 2.a through 2.d) However, Applicant disclosed that \nhe was terminated from his employment in 2019 due to a positive drug test on the SCA. \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted all SOR allegations with no explanation. (Item 2) \nApplicant was interviewed in 2020 related to his background investigation. He \ntold the investigator he smoked marijuana and only stopped when it was time to be \ntested for a new employer. Applicant admitted that he \u201ccleaned\u201d himself for a test and \nthen continued to use marijuana daily. (Item 4) He began using marijuana in high school \nand his usage has been consistent to the present. \nIn that 2020 subject interview, Applicant told the investigator that he signed \npaperwork on the first day of employment, but he is uncertain of the policy regarding \nillegal drugs because he did not read the paperwork. Also, he is unclear about the use \nof marijuana when employed, but he knows it is not approved upon hiring. (Item 4) \nIn 2014, Applicant used LSD about three times with his younger brother and his \nfriends. (Item 4) In addition, Applicant told the subject investigator that in April 2019, he \nintentionally misused a prescribed medication \u2013 the opioid Norco for two weeks, taking \nthree pills at once about three times per week. He stole some of the pills from his \nmother. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nIn 2020, on weekends he used cocaine with his brother and friends. Applicant \nstated that he is usually drunk when he uses cocaine. (Item 4) His mother, brother and \nclose friends use illegal drugs. Applicant does not believe that his drug use has had had \na negative impact on his life other than when he was terminated from employment. He \nhas not had any counseling or treatment for drug use. (Item 4) \nIn the attached interrogatories, Applicant states that he has no intention of further \nuse of illegal drugs and that he stopped immediately following his subject interview. \nApplicant wants to continue with a professional career and hopes that his previous \nactions do not affect or jeopardize his chance to obtain a security clearance. (Item 4). \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he stated that he was completely honest in \nhis interview and was nervous when he was completing his application. He stated that \nhe believed he could change his answers on the SCA during his interview. He wanted to \nleave all dishonesty and poor judgment in the past. Applicant claimed he has distanced \nhimself from anyone who uses. His career is important to him and obtaining a security \nclearance is his highest priority. (Answer to FORM) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for this guideline is set forth in AG \u00b6 24, where it is noted \nthat the illegal use of a controlled substance, and the use of other substances that can \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. This is because such behavior may lead to physical or psychological \nimpairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. Such use also raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions establish the basis for disqualification under Guideline H. \nHe has a history of using several different types of illegal drugs since 2006. The record \nalso establishes that Applicant used illegal drugs after completing his SCA until 2020. \nHe signed a policy for employment concerning drug use but claims he did not read it. \nHe failed a 2019 drug test and was terminated from prior employment. Applicant\u2019s \nproblematic judgment is also evident when he disclosed that he cleans his system to \navoid testing positive on a drug screen, and then resumes daily use. This shows a \nrecklessness. His avoidance of drug use detection speaks volumes about Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, lack of good judgment, and trustworthiness. This is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 \n25(a): any substance misuse, AG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, \nincluding \u2026 purchase or sale; AG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to \nclassified information or holding a sensitive position; and AG 25(g) expressed intent to \ncontinue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly \ncommit to discontinue such misuse. The Government\u2019s substantial evidence, as \nprovided by Applicant\u2019s admissions, thus raises security concerns under Guideline H. \nTherefore, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate related security concerns. \nUnder Guideline H, conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \ndrug involvement and substance misuse are enumerated. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome this problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing \nor avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse \nis grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.   \nApplicant\u2019s last use of illegal drugs or controlled substance was in 2020 after his \nsubject interview and after he completed his SCA. At the time he was seeking to obtain \na security clearance. He has not identified any circumstances that would suggest the \ndrug use is unlikely to recur. He stated that he stopped because he wants to obtain a \nclearance and continue his career. This casts doubt about his judgment and reliability \nbecause he used a technique to cleanse himself after the use of marijuana to avoid \nfuture detection. I find that none of the mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \nApplicant admitted in his answer that he intentionally falsified his SCA regarding \nany drug use. He claimed that he could change his answers on his SCA when he had \nan interview. He knew he had used the illegal drugs over an extensive period of time. \nHe stated in his response to the FORM that now he knows the importance of answering \neverything on the SCA truthfully. He did not know that previous drug use would affect \nhis ability to progress in his career. I find that Applicant intentionally falsified material \nfacts on his 2019 SCA regarding his illegal drug use. He stopped just after his subject \ninterview. Even if his claim is found to be credible, the period of abstinence is too short \ngiven the extended history of illegal drug use over a period of a decade. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole \nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nApplicant intentionally provided false information. He has not identified sufficient efforts \nthat he made to correct the falsifications. The offenses are not minor, and he has not \nexpressed any remorse. His lack of candor and inconsistent statements do not \npersuade me that his illegal drug use will not recur. It casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. He has not presented sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the personal conduct concerns. Any doubts must be resolved in favor of the \nGovernment. I find none of the mitigating conditions apply in this case. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, one must evaluate security clearance eligibility \nby considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. \nConsideration shall be given to the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nThe final determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and conducted a whole-person \nanalysis based on the record. \nI have doubts as to Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, and reliability. Any \ndoubts must be resolved in favor of the Government. Under these circumstances, I find \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, nor under personal conduct due to intentional falsification of his \nSCA. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nNoreen A.

From March 1991 until March 1999, he served in the Army Inactive Reserve and was honorably discharged. Since August 2019, Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor. (Item 3.) Under Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant (1) used marijuana with varying frequency from about February 1994 to present; (2) currently uses marijuana daily; (3) has grown marijuana from about 2002 to present; (4) used marijuana after completing his SCA on June 9, 2020; (5) purchased marijuana from about February 1994 to at least 2002; (6) was arrested in about August 1998 for possession of marijuana and charged with violating the Uniform Controlled Substances Act and possessing instruments of a crime. (Item 1.) Applicant admitted the Guideline H allegations, noting that his use was primarily medicinal and personal, which is legal in his home state. He also corrected the year he began growing marijuana to 2012, not 2002, as alleged. Finally, Applicant answered that he did not recall the exact charges of his 1998 arrest. (Item 3.) The record supports the SOR offenses charged in Applicant\u2019s 1998 arrest. (Item 6.) In his SCA, Applicant stated that he grows his own marijuana in quantities that are within his home state\u2019s legal limits. He has not sold or purchased marijuana in a decade. (Item 4.)

The \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) on November 30, 2020, detailing security concerns under \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse, and Guideline E, Personal \nConduct. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec.

The SOR and the Answer (Items 1 and 3, respectively) are the \npleadings in this case. Items 2, and 4 through 6 are admitted without objection. The case \nwas assigned to me on June 24, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 48 years old. He is married and has two children, a 7-year old daughter \nand a 15-year old son. Applicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree (2002). From March 1991 until \nMarch 1999, he served in the Army Inactive Reserve and was honorably discharged. \nSince August 2019, Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor. (Item 3.) \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant (1) used marijuana with \nvarying frequency from about February 1994 to present; (2) currently uses marijuana \ndaily; (3) has grown marijuana from about 2002 to present; (4) used marijuana after \ncompleting his SCA on June 9, 2020; (5) purchased marijuana from about February 1994 \nto at least 2002; (6) was arrested in about August 1998 for possession of marijuana and \ncharged with violating the Uniform Controlled Substances Act and possessing \ninstruments of a crime. (Item 1.) \nApplicant admitted the Guideline H allegations, noting that his use was primarily \nmedicinal and personal, which is legal in his home state. He also corrected the year he \nbegan growing marijuana to 2012, not 2002, as alleged. Finally, Applicant answered that \nhe did not recall the exact charges of his 1998 arrest. (Item 3.) The record supports the \nSOR offenses charged in Applicant\u2019s 1998 arrest. (Item 6.) In his SCA, Applicant stated \nthat he grows his own marijuana in quantities that are within his home state\u2019s legal limits. \nHe has not sold or purchased marijuana in a decade. (Item 4.) \nApplicant uses marijuana daily, because it helps relax him and controls his anxiety. \nHe only uses it in the evening after his children have been put to bed. Applicant has never \nengaged in drug trafficking or the misuse of prescription drugs. His use has not affected \nhis personal, professional, emotional health, reputation, judgment, or financial \nresponsibility. Applicant could stop his use at any time, if it were required by his \nemployment. (Item 5 at Personal Subject Interview (PSI).) He intends to use marijuana in \nthe future, unless he is actively holding a security clearance. (Item 4.) \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR cross-alleged SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d. Applicant \nanswered that he \u201cwas completely honest and forthcoming \u2026 and did not attempt to hide \nanything.\u201d (Item 3.) The SOR did not allege any falsification issues.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \nA2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nGuideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nUnder AG H for drug use, suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put into \nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG \n\u00b6 24 sets forth the concern, as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person's \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C.\u00a7 802. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any \nof the behaviors listed above. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions or factors: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance . . . including \ncultivation . . . ; and \nAG \u00b6 25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nabuse . . . . \nThe only potentially applicable mitigating factor here is quoted below: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \nApplicant admitted that he has been using marijuana with varying frequency from \nabout February 1994 to present, including daily use currently, that he has grown\nmarijuana from about 2012 to present for his personal use, and purchased marijuana from\nabout February 1994 to at least 2002. He was arrested in about August 1998 in\npossession of marijuana and charged with violating the Uniform Controlled Substances\nAct and possessing instruments of a crime. He also admitted he intended to continue\nusing marijuana in the future, unless it is prohibited by his employer or he is actively\nholding a security clearance. Facts admitted by an applicant in an SCA, an answer to an\nSOR, or in an interview require no further proof from the Government. ISCR Case No.\n94-1159 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1995) (\u201cany admissions [applicant] made to the SOR\nallegations . . . relieve Department Counsel of its burden of proof\u201d); ISCR Case No. 94-\n0569 at 4 and n.1 (App. Bd.

In an October 25, 2014 \nmemorandum, the Director of National Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is \na security concern. James R. Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, Memorandum: \nAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use (October 25, 2014).

It emphasizes that federal \nlaw remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production and \ndistribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position \nare prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior medicinal, or recreational marijuana use) remains \nrelevant, but not determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant\u2019s \nbehavior raises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s past use of marijuana and his expressed intent to use in the \nfuture, disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), and (g) apply here. The next inquiry is \nwhether any mitigating factors apply. \nI have considered mitigating factor AG \u00b6 26(a). Applicant began using marijuana \nalmost 30 years ago. Therefore, the inception of his use was long ago. He has, however, \ncontinued his regular use to the present day. And Applicant intends to continue to use \nmarijuana. His use has been frequent, and Applicant plans to continue using marijuana \nin the future, unless it conflicts with his employment or his security clearance. His use is \nnot mitigated by AG \u00b6 26(a). \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nIn assessing an allegation of detrimental personal conduct, I consider not only the \nallegation and applicant\u2019s answer but all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1)-(9) and \n2(f)(1)-(6) (explaining the whole person concept). Under Guideline E for personal conduct, \nthe concern is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment \u2026 or unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability classified or sensitive information.\u201d Guideline E and Guideline \nH have common concerns relevant to an applicant\u2019s care in handling classified or \nsensitive information. Those concerns must be carefully observed in the national security \narena. Therefore, Applicant\u2019s conduct has not been mitigated. \nWhole Person Concept \nThe record raises doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, \nand ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6). Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant has not \nmet his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the SOR allegations: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.- 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant access to classified information. \nPhilip J.

He was previously \nself-employed as a part-time security installation contractor (July 2016 \u2013 June 2020); or \nemployed by other employers as a senior account manager (January 2019 \u2013 November \n2019); sales representative (November 2016 \u2013 July 2017); senior account manager (July \n2015 \u2013 July 2016); and sales engineer (May 2012 \u2013 July 2015). His preliminary education \nwas not reported. He attended a technical school for six months and a university for eight \nmonths, but never received a degree. He has never served with the U.S. military. He was \ngranted a confidential clearance in 2013. He was married in 2010 and divorced in 2019. \nHe has one daughter, born in 2013. He has been cohabiting since August 2017. \nFinancial Considerations  \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 3 (SF 86, dated June 30, 2020); Item 4 \n(Enhanced Subject Interview, dated August 10, 2020); Item 6 (Combined Experian, \nTransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated July 30, 2020); Item 5 (Verato Credit \nReport, dated February 3, 2021); and Item 2 (Answer to the SOR, dated September 21, \n2021). \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his SF 86, Applicant reported having a number of financial issues, including \nfederal and state income tax issues, child support issues, and various delinquent \naccounts. He contended that the major factors leading to his financial problems were a \ndivorce, child custody battle, and a loss of income when he opened a restaurant that failed \nto generate income. He acknowledged that he had taken no action regarding most of his \naccounts and stated an intention to file for bankruptcy \u201cin the next 30 days.\u201d (Item 3 at 42-\n52) Eight months later, on August 10, 2020, he was interviewed by an investigator from \nthe U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). During that interview, Applicant initially \nacknowledged a number of delinquent accounts, but had to be confronted with other \naccounts that he failed to address. He repeated both the factors he claimed caused his \nfinancial problems as well as his intention to file for bankruptcy. (Item 4 at 8-12) \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he decided that it would be in his \nbest interest to make efforts to pay off his debts rather than filing for bankruptcy. In that \nregard, shortly before receiving the SOR, he finally started to contact some of his creditors \n(Item 2 at 1) \nThe SOR alleged 16 still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $59,631, as \nset forth below: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. is a state tax lien in the amount of $7,016 that was entered against \nApplicant in June 2018. (Item 7 at 1) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant contended that \nhe had moved out of the state in November 2007, and that there was no obligation to file \nin his previous state of residence for 2008. An audit was supposedly ordered and \nApplicant claimed that he would hear the final result up to 90 days after the review. He \nsubmitted a copy of his 2008 income tax return (Exhibit A), but while it has been more \nthan 90 days after the audit was to have been completed, he has not submitted ---\nany \ndocumentation to support his contentions about the audit or his liability regarding the lien. \nThe lien has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. is a civil judgment on an automobile loan in the amount of $13,084 \nobtained by a federal credit union against Applicant in July 2018. (Item 4 at 10; Item 5 at \n5; Item 6 at 11; Item 7 at 2) On August 18, 2021, Applicant paid the creditor $10,300 to \nsettle the account for less than what was owed, and the creditor acknowledged that it \nwould release the judgment. (Exhibit B) The judgment has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. is a civil judgment on an unspecified type of account in the amount of \n$8,626 obtained by a federal credit union against Applicant in December 2018. (Item 4 at \n10; Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 11; Item 7 at 2; Item, 3 at 49) On August 18, 2021, Applicant \npaid the creditor $10,300 to settle the account for less than what was owed, and the \ncreditor acknowledged that it would release the judgment. (Exhibit B) The judgment has \nbeen resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. is a civil eviction judgment in the amount of $2,980 obtained by a \nproperty management company in October 2019. (Item 7 at 4) Applicant contacted the \ncreditor on September 13, 2021, after the SOR was issued, and he disputed the amount \nowed. As of one week later, he had not heard a response. No other activity regarding the \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naccount has been reported since that time. (Item 2 at 2) The judgment has not been \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. is a child-support-arrearage in the approximate amount of $14,768 on \nan account that was opened in 2016. (Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 8) Applicant admitted the \nallegation, but claimed he was making additional payments over and above the required \npayments to reduce the arrearage. As of September 2021, he had reduced the balance \nto approximately $11,925, including arrears, interest, and fees. (Exhibit C) The account \nis in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. is an alarm-system account with an unpaid balance of $2,065 that was \nplaced for collection in 2018. (Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 8; Item 3 at 48-49) He initially refused \nto pay for the service claiming that he did not agree to a five-year contract. In his Answer \nto the SOR, Applicant contended that he had reached a settlement agreement with the \ncontractor, and that he would pay the contractor $1,400 within 30 days of October 1, 2021. \n(Item 2 at 2) Applicant failed to submit any documentation such as a written agreement, \nreceipt, cancelled check, or credit-card payment to support his contention. In the absence \nof any verifiable documentation, the account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $992 that was placed \nfor collection in 2019. (Item 4 at 11; Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 9; Item 3 at 50-51) In his Answer \nto the SOR, Applicant contended that he had reached a settlement agreement with the \ncontractor, and that he would pay the contractor $694.62 within 30 days of October 1, \n2021. (Item 2 at 2-3) Applicant failed to submit any documentation such as a written \nagreement, receipt, cancelled check, or credit-card payment to support his contention. In \nthe absence of any verifiable documentation, the account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h. is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $881 that was placed \nfor collection in 2019. (Item 4 at 11; Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 9) In his Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant contended that he had reached a settlement agreement with the contractor, \nand that he would pay the contractor $661.92 within 30 days of October 1, 2021. (Item 2 \nat 3) Applicant failed to submit any documentation such as a written agreement, receipt, \ncancelled check, or credit-card payment to support his contention. In the absence of any \nverifiable documentation, the account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i. is a department store charge-account with an unpaid balance of $836 \nthat was placed for collection and charged off in 2012. (Item 4 at 9; Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at \n9; Item 3 at 45) Applicant acknowledged the account during his OPM interview, but now \ndisputes the account. (Item 2 at 3) Applicant failed to submit any documentation such as \na written dispute stating the basis for the dispute. The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j. is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $494 that was placed \nfor collection and charged off in 2009. (Item 4 at 9; Item 5 at 4; Item 6 at 9; Item 3 at 45-\n46) On September 22, 2021, Applicant paid the creditor an unspecified amount to settle \nthe account for less than what was owed, and the creditor acknowledged that it would \nreduce the unpaid balance to zero.  (Exhibit D) The account has been resolved. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k. is a cable-television account with an unpaid balance of $426 that was \nplaced for collection in 2016. (Item 4 at 9; Item 5 at 4; Item 6 at 10; Item 3 at 46-47) In his \nAnswer to the SOR, Applicant contended that he had reached a settlement agreement \nwith the contractor, and that he would pay the contractor $256.18 within 30 days of \nOctober 1, 2021. (Item 2 at 3) Applicant failed to submit any documentation such as a \nwritten agreement, receipt, cancelled check, or credit-card payment to support his \ncontention. In the absence of any verifiable documentation, the account has not been \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.l. is a cable-television account with an unpaid balance of $383 that was \nplaced for collection in 2019. (Item 4 at 10; Item 5 at 4; Item 6 at 10; Item 3 at 49-50) On \nSeptember 20, 2021, Applicant paid the creditor an unspecified amount to settle the \naccount for less than what was owed, and the creditor acknowledged that the account \nwas satisfied.  (Exhibit E) The account has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m. is an automobile-loan account with an unpaid balance of $374 that \nwas placed for collection and charged off in 2009. (Item 4 at 11; Item 5 at 4; Item 6 at 10) \nOn August 18, 2021, Applicant paid the creditor $374.27 to pay off the account, and the \ncreditor acknowledged that the account was paid in full. (Exhibit B) The account has been \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.n. is an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance of $341 that \nwas placed for collection in 2017. (Item 4 at 11; Item 5 at 4-5; Item 6 at 10) In his Answer \nto the SOR, Applicant contended that he had reached a settlement agreement with the \ncontractor, and that he would pay the contractor $238.64 within 30 days of October 1, \n2021. (Item 2 at 4) Applicant failed to submit any documentation such as a written \nagreement, receipt, cancelled check, or credit-card payment to support his contention. In \nthe absence of any verifiable documentation, the account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.o. is an automobile-loan account with an unpaid balance of $5,415 that \nwas placed for collection after a vehicle was repossessed. (Item 4 at 11; Item 5 at 5; Item \n6 at 5; Item 3 at 51-52) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant contended that he had \nreached a settlement agreement with the contractor, and that he would pay the contractor \n$1,355 within 30 days of October 1, 2021. (Item 2 at 4) Applicant failed to submit any \ndocumentation such as a written agreement, receipt, cancelled check, or credit-card \npayment to support his contention. In the absence of any verifiable documentation, the \naccount has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.p. started out as an unpaid balance of $950 on an unspecified type of \naccount that was placed for collection, charged off, and sold. It transitioned into a civil \njudgment in the amount of $1,464.94 plus $55 in costs obtained by purchaser of the \naccount against Applicant in 2019. (Item 4 at 14; Item 6 at 11) Applicant contended that \nhis wages were garnished in 2019 to satisfy the judgment. (Item 2 at 4) While he did not \nsubmit evidence of such garnishment action regarding this particular creditor, the court \nrecord indicates that the judgment was satisfied on October 21, 2020. (Exhibit F) The \naccount and successor judgment have been involuntarily resolved.  \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or anything to describe with \nany specificity Applicant\u2019s current financial situation. Applicant did not report his net \nmonthly income, his monthly household expenses, or any monthly debt payments. In the \nabsence of such information, I am unable to determine if he has any monthly remainder \navailable for savings or spending. There is a paucity of evidence to indicate that his \nfinancial problems are now under control, and it is difficult to determine if Applicant is \ncurrently in a better position financially than he had been. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe SOR alleged 16 still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $59,631. \nApplicant attributed his inability to maintain those accounts in a current status to a divorce, \na child-custody battle, and a loss of income when he opened a restaurant that failed to \ngenerate income. Although he offered an explanation for his 2007 state income tax issue, \nhe failed to submit any documentation to support his contentions that it was a mistake \nmade by the state. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) have been established, but there is no \nevidence that Applicant has been unwilling to satisfy his debts regardless of an ability to \ndo so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) minimally apply, but none of the other conditions apply. \nApplicant\u2019s marital difficulties and child-custody battle appear to have commenced in \n2016, and while he may have fought with his wife over custody, for reasons that he never \nfully explained, his new restaurant expenses took priority over his child-support \nresponsibilities. Over a multi-year period, Applicant avoided contact with his creditors. In \nhis June 2020 SF 86, and again during his OPM interview in August 2020, Applicant \nstated an intention to file for bankruptcy \u201cin the next 30 days.\u201d That action never took \nplace. It was not until his September 2021 Answer to the SOR that he claimed to have \nreconsidered and decided to address his debts and not seek bankruptcy. While he did \naddress several of his delinquent debts, he did not do so for the majority of them until \nafter his OPM interview. Of the 16 alleged delinquent accounts, he settled or otherwise \nresolved (by voluntary payment or involuntary garnishment) 6 of them. In addition, the \nchild-support arrearage was reduced from approximately $14,768 to $11,925. Applicant \ncontended that several other accounts were resolved, but he failed to submit any \ndocumentation to support his contentions. He also disputed several accounts, but failed \nto provide any reasonable basis to do so. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant actually ignored his delinquent \naccounts (and his child-support obligations) for a substantial multi-year period. Because \nof his failure to confirm resolution of a number of delinquent accounts that he claimed he \nhad settled, and his failure to furnish documentation regarding those accounts, the \noverwhelming evidence leads to the conclusion that his financial problems are not under \ncontrol. Furthermore, he is still substantially in arrears regarding his child-support \nobligations. He has not acted responsibly by failing to address his delinquent accounts \nwhile employed and by failing to make limited, if any, efforts of working with his creditors. \nThe Appeal Board has previously commented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests.

Sept. 18, 2018) In this instance, \nApplicant failed to offer any evidence that he began making such efforts before his OPM \ninterview. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant repeatedly claimed \nthat he would file for bankruptcy. He then changed his mind and chose to address some \nof the delinquent accounts, apparently motivated by the issuance of the SOR. One \naccount was resolved by involuntary garnishment. \nThe nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties, and his \ngeneral failure to voluntarily and timely start to resolve them until substantial investigatory \naction was taken, is sufficient to conclude that his financial difficulties were not infrequent. \nThe timeliness of his efforts to resolve his debts is not good, and the delay in commencing \nto do so, is another negative factor. The subsequent verifiable positive and partially \nsuccessful efforts are good, but not timely. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or current financial \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s in-action under the circumstances casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. \nBd.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nsupport technician with his current employer since June 2020. He was previously self-\nemployed as a part-time security installation contractor (July 2016 \u2013 June 2020); or \nemployed by other employers as a senior account manager (January 2019 \u2013 November \n2019); sales representative (November 2016 \u2013 July 2017); senior account manager (July \n2015 \u2013 July 2016); and sales engineer (May 2012 \u2013 July 2015). He attended a technical \nschool for six months and a university for eight months, but never received a degree. He \nwas granted a confidential clearance in 2013. Of the 16 alleged delinquent accounts, he \nsettled or otherwise resolved (by voluntary payment or involuntary garnishment) 6 of \nthem. In addition, the child-support arrearage was reduced from approximately $14,768 \nto $11,925. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant had 16 still-delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $59,631. Included in that amount was a child-support arrearage of $14,768 \nthat was caused when Applicant prioritized a new restaurant over his child\u2019s welfare. Over \na multi-year period, he avoided contact with his creditors. He repeatedly stated an \nintention to file for bankruptcy \u201cin the next 30 days.\u201d That action never took place. It was \nnot until late 2021 that he claimed to have reconsidered, and decided to address his debts \nand not seek bankruptcy. Although he offered an explanation for his 2007 state income \ntax issue, he failed to submit any documentation to support his contentions that it was a \nmistake made by the state. \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s failure to confirm a significant number of purported \nsettlement agreements with his creditors, and his failure to furnish documentation \nregarding those particular accounts, the overwhelming evidence leads to the conclusion \nthat his financial problems are not under control. He has not acted responsibly by failing \nto address his delinquent accounts while employed and by failing to make limited, if any, \nefforts of working with his creditors over a multi-year period. There are lingering questions \nif Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had been, as well as \ncontinuing doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nWhile Applicant did eventually resolve several of his delinquent debts, and he has \nreduced his child-support arrearage, his track record of unverifiable efforts to resolve a \nnumber of his delinquent debts, and the lengthy period of non-contact with his creditors, \nis negative and disappointing. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b., 1.c., and 1.e.: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d., 1.f. through 1.i.: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j., 1.l., and 1.m.: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k., 1.n. and 1.o.: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Items 2, \n3, 4, 5) \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged in its SOR that Applicant had 10 \ndelinquent debts totaling about $63,500. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts consisted of child-\nsupport payments due to State A, credit cards, and personal loans. Applicant admitted \nall the debts described in the SOR.

His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. Applicant alleged \nthat his financial issues arose as a result of his having to pay more than he could afford \nfor medical bills in about mid-2019. As of late 2019, he has been working with a debt \nconsolidation company in order to resolve his delinquent debts. The Guideline F SOR \nallegations are established through the Government\u2019s evidence and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions. (Items 1-4, 6-8) \nThe $7,880 child-support debt to State A listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a has been resolved \nthrough payments. Applicant presented documentary evidence in his response to the \nSOR that, in March 2021, he made three payments on this debt for a combined total of \n$3,700. His 2022 credit report reflects that this account is current. (Items 1-4, 6, 8) \nThe $23,764 personal loan listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b, has not been resolved. Applicant \nclaimed that he has been making payments on this debt since late 2019 and that he has \nsatisfied it. He provided what may be documents from his debt consolidation company \npurportedly showing that he has made 24 of 24 settlement payments on this debt. \nHowever, his 2022 credit report still shows this debt as charged off with a last payment \ndate in March 2019. He provided no documents from the creditor showing the debt has \nbeen resolved. Moreover, his documents that may be from his debt consolidation \ncompany lack sufficient context such as the amounts of the alleged payments or an \nagreement with the creditor to conclude the debt has been satisfied. (Items 1-4, 6-8) \nThe personal loan and credit-card debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.i have been \nresolved. Applicant claimed that he has been making payments on these debts since \nlate 2019 and that he has satisfied them. He provided what may be documents from his \ndebt consolidation company showing settlement payments made on these debts.

He \nprovided what may be documents from his debt consolidation company purportedly \nshowing that he has made his settlement payment on this debt. However, his 2022 \ncredit report still shows this debt as charged off with a last payment date in April 2019. \nHe provided no documents from the creditor showing the debt has been resolved. \nMoreover, his documents that may be from his debt consolidation company lack \nsufficient context such as the amounts of the alleged payments or an agreement with \nthe creditor to conclude the debt has been satisfied. (Items 1, 2, 4, 7, 8) \nAs evidenced by his 2014 clearance interview, Applicant had delinquent debts \nwhen that interview was conducted.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had many financial delinquencies. These delinquencies included child-\nsupport payments, credit cards, and personal loans. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions and shifts the burden to Applicant to provide \nevidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThere is documentary evidence that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.i \nhave been resolved through payments and are now current or satisfied. The debts in \nthose SOR subparagraphs are concluded for Applicant \nThe evidence shows that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g is the same account as that \nalleged in in SOR \u00b6 1.d. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g is concluded for Applicant. \nDespite having made some payments to address some of the debts in the SOR, \nApplicant still has financial delinquencies. The delinquent debt described in SOR \u00b6 1.h \nremains unaddressed. As evidenced by the information in his 2014 clearance interview, \nhe has failed to stay current on a number of his credit obligations in the past. Applicant \nhas not met his burden of showing that his financial issues are a thing of the past, are \ninfrequent, or are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant attributed his financial issues to having to pay medical bills for an \nunspecified medical issue in mid-2019. An unexpected medical emergency is normally \nconsidered a circumstance beyond one\u2019s control, and I find as such in this instance. \nApplicant did not specify the nature of the medical issue, nor did he specify how much \nhe paid in medical bills. Applicant also did not provide an overview of his budget, \nincome, or expenses. Without more information, such as the timing of the payments, or \nthe amount of his medical debt, I cannot determine whether his efforts can be \nconsidered acting responsibly under the circumstances. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20(b) does not \napply. \nApplicant has presented evidence that he is receiving some form of financial \ncounseling through a debt consolidation company in order to address his financial \nissues. Applicant\u2019s payments on some of his debts are corroborated by documents and \nappear to have been made prior to the date the Government issued its SOR. For \nexample, for several SOR debts, Applicant alleged he made payments through a debt \nconsolidation company and his 2022 credit report reflected payments. However, several \nof the SOR debts on which Applicant alleged payments are not conclusively \ncorroborated by documents. For example, Applicant alleged payments on some SOR \ndebts and provided documents that he claimed are from a debt consolidation company \nthat show payments, but his 2022 credit report does not reflect these payments. It is \nreasonable to expect Applicant to present documentation about the resolution of \nspecific debts. As he has provided evidence of his use of a debt consolidation company \nand adequate proof of payments on some of his debts, he has partially shown that he is \nresolving his financial problems. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and (d) partially apply. \nNone of the mitigating factors fully apply. Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his \nfinancial issues through payments, while a step in the right direction, do not constitute a \ntrack record of financial responsibility. His financial issues continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant\u2019s 2019 criminal charges for destruction of property, entering property to \ndamage, and dumping trash on a highway or private property establish the above \ndisqualifying condition. The evidence does not establish the basis for the 2019 \nprotective order, and I cannot assume that it was entered because of Applicant\u2019s \ncriminal conduct. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence that the 2019 protective order \nissued against Applicant was criminal in nature, and that portion of SOR \u00b6 2.a does not \nestablish the above disqualifying condition. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s misdemeanor criminal charges relate to an incident that occurred two \nand a half years ago. There is insufficient evidence that he has engaged in criminal \nbehavior before or since. This passage of time since the criminal behavior occurred, \nalong with the lack of evidence of earlier criminal conduct convinces me that criminal \nconduct is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. It also convinces me that there is evidence of \nsuccessful rehabilitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and (d) apply. The Guideline J allegations are \nmitigated and SOR \u00b6 2.a is concluded for Applicant. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant failed to list his aforementioned criminal charges on his January 2020 \nSF 86 despite being required to do so. He admitted that he did not disclose this \ninformation but claimed the omission was unintentional as he had never been arrested, \nbut merely charged. While Applicant disclosed one required debt, he also failed to \ndisclose all of the debts that he was required to on his January 2020 SF 86. He \nadmitted this allegation, but alluded to his understanding that those undisclosed debts \nwere no longer delinquent. While Applicant\u2019s apparent understanding of what he was \nrequired to report on the relevant portions of his January 2020 SF 86 is inaccurate, his \nmisunderstanding and explanation of that misunderstanding is plausible. Given \nApplicant\u2019s plausible explanations, I find he did not deliberately omit or falsify \ninformation on his January 2020 SF 86. Guideline E is not established and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a \nand 3.b are resolved in favor of Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

Despite having a month to further address this \nconcern, Applicant has submitted nothing in this regard. (TR at page 27 line 24 to page \n28 line 7.) \n1.t. Applicant denies that he had a past-due debt to Creditor T in the amount of \nabout $1,809. As this debt does not appear as past-due on the Government\u2019s most \nrecent May 2022 credit report, this allegation is found for Applicant. (TR at page 28 lines \n8~25, and GX 7.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has a long history of \ndelinquencies. He has about $57,000 of past-due debt that he has yet to address. He \nhas not demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n20 has not been established. Financial Considerations is found against Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.s: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.t: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c and denied 1.d. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 49 years old. He married in 2009 and has two children, ages 12 and 10 years old. He served in the military from 1993 to 1997 and was honorably discharged. He has worked for the same employer since 2008. Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to a period in 2018, when the tenants living in a property he rented failed to pay the rent, and he was unable to pay the mortgage. The property was foreclosed. In his background investigation with a government investigator, he indicated once the property was foreclosed and sold, he had no future issues with it. He also stated that his financial problems were due to paying daycare expenses, and he had too much debt. (GE 4) In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted he owes the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($27,302). The debt, which is listed on his credit report as a line-of-credit has been charged off. Applicant did not provide any information of his efforts to resolve the debt. It is unclear if Applicant believes this debt was included with his mortgage foreclosure, which occurred in 2018.

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn September 9, 2021, Applicant\u2019s answered the SOR, and he elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

(Item 1 is the SOR) Applicant \ndid not submit a response to the FORM or file objections to any evidence offered. All \nItems are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on March 2, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c and denied 1.d. After \na thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is 49 years old. He married in 2009 and has two children, ages 12 and \n10 years old. He served in the military from 1993 to 1997 and was honorably discharged. \nHe has worked for the same employer since 2008. \nApplicant attributes his financial difficulties to a period in 2018, when the tenants \nliving in a property he rented failed to pay the rent, and he was unable to pay the \nmortgage. The property was foreclosed. In his background investigation with a \ngovernment investigator, he indicated once the property was foreclosed and sold, he had \nno future issues with it. He also stated that his financial problems were due to paying \ndaycare expenses, and he had too much debt. (GE 4) \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted he owes the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a \n($27,302). The debt, which is listed on his credit report as a line-of-credit has been \ncharged off. Applicant did not provide any information of his efforts to resolve the debt. It \nis unclear if Applicant believes this debt was included with his mortgage foreclosure, \nwhich occurred in 2018. He did not provide evidence as to the debt\u2019s current status. It is \nunresolved. (Item 2, 4) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($10,867) is credit card debt. During Applicant\u2019s \nJune 2020 background interview, he told the government investigator that he had too \nmuch debt and was unable to make payments on this account. He began receiving \ncollection notices and phone calls regarding the debt in about 2017. He made no attempt \nto pay the debt and forgot about it, but now had enough earnings to begin paying it in \nAugust 2020. He would arrange an automatic payment plan. He did not provide any \nevidence that he has made arrangements to pay this debt. It is unresolved. (Item 4, 5, 6) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($8,328) is a credit card debt. Applicant \nacknowledge to the government investigator that he owed the debt and was unable to \npay it. He began receiving collection notices by mail and phone in 2016. He forgot about \nthe debt. He told the investigator that he now is earning enough to pay the debt and would \nbegin paying $150 a month beginning in August 2020. He did not provide any evidence \nthat he has made arrangements to pay this debt. It is unresolved. (Items 4, 5, 6) \nApplicant provided documentation that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($57) is resolved. \n(Item 2). Credit reports from May 2020 and March 2021 corroborate the delinquent debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 1.c.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has three delinquent debts that began accumulating in 2016 that he is \nunable to pay. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted he owes the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c and they are \nunresolved. He attributed his financial problems to tenants that failed to pay their rent and \nhe had his property foreclosed. He also admitted he had daycare costs and did not have \nthe money to pay his debts. He has not provided any evidence to show that he has made \nefforts to resolve any of the alleged debts. Although, the foreclosure may have been due \nto circumstances beyond his control, his credit card debts were in collection in 2016 and \n2017, before the tenant issue arose. Applicant has not provided evidence that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. \nDuring his background interview Applicant told the investigator he was making \npayment arrangements to resolve the two credit card debts alleged, but failed to provide \nevidence that he is making the promised payments. The circumstances surrounding the \nforeclosure may have been beyond his control, but Applicant failed to act responsibly \nunder the circumstances even after promising to make payments. His delinquent debts \nare recent and there is no evidence he has received financial counseling, that he made \ngood-faith efforts to resolve the debts, or that there are clear indications his financial \nproblems are being resolved. The above mitigating conditions do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph     1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant denied all the allegations in the SOR, except for SOR allegation \u00b6 1.d. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 65-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been employed with the defense contractor \u201cfor 22 years.\u201d He is married, and has three adult children. (TR at page 35 line 3 to page 46 line 6, and GX 2 at page 7.) Guideline F - Financial Considerations 1.a. and 1.b. Applicant denies that he is indebted to Creditor A, as the result of student loans he incurred on behalf of his son. These student loans totaled about $272,000. Applicant paid these student loans in August of 2021, prior to the issuance of the SOR. (TR at page 72 line 21 to page 73 line 23, at page 108 line 24 to page 109 line 5, and AppXs C~E and G.) 1.c. and 1.d. Applicant admits that his wages were garnished, at the rate of $800 a month, to pay back delinquent student loans to the Department of Education. Unbeknownst to Applicant, that garnishment stopped (his wife handled their finances), and he has an outstanding debt of about $84,000. (TR at page 74 line 8 to page 75 line 5, and AppX I.) Applicant made a one-time payment of $5,000 towards this past-due debt, and is now making monthly payments of $500 to the Department of Education.

DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on June \n15, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied all the allegations in the SOR, except for SOR allegation \u00b6 1.d. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 65-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor \u201cfor 22 years.\u201d He is married, and has three adult \nchildren. (TR at page 35 line 3 to page 46 line 6, and GX 2 at page 7.) \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n1.a. and 1.b. Applicant denies that he is indebted to Creditor A, as the result of \nstudent loans he incurred on behalf of his son. These student loans totaled about \n$272,000. Applicant paid these student loans in August of 2021, prior to the issuance of \nthe SOR. (TR at page 72 line 21 to page 73 line 23, at page 108 line 24 to page 109 line \n5, and AppXs C~E and G.) \n1.c. and 1.d. Applicant admits that his wages were garnished, at the rate of $800 \na month, to pay back delinquent student loans to the Department of Education. \nUnbeknownst to Applicant, that garnishment stopped (his wife handled their finances), \nand he has an outstanding debt of about $84,000.  (TR at page 74 line 8 to page 75 line \n5, and AppX I.) Applicant made a one-time payment of $5,000 towards this past-due \ndebt, and is now making monthly payments of $500 to the Department of Education. \n(TR at page 109 line 6 to page 110 line 10, and AppXs G~I.)   \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n2.a. and 2.b. Applicant denies that he \u201cdeliberately failed to disclose\u201d his \ndelinquencies and Federal Debt, noted in Paragraph 1, when he answered Section 26 \non his August 2020 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). \nApplicant credibly avers that he was going through \u201cfamily issues\u201d at the time and made \n\u201can honest mistake.\u201d It is important to note that Applicant made these disclosures when \nhe executed his January 2016 e-QIP, four years earlier. (TR at page 75 line 6 to page \n77 line 20, at page 110 line 11 to page 111 line 6, and GX 1 at pages 29~31.) \nAccordingly, the Government was aware of these delinquencies, which Applicant has \nnow addressed. Based on all the available evidence, I find that Applicant did not have \nany intent to deceive the Government about these debts. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations \nApplicant had substantial student loan debts The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has addressed all of his alleged financial delinquencies. He has paid \nthose student loans not held by the Federal Government, and is making monthly \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npayments to the Department of Education for the rest. He has demonstrated that future \nfinancial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has been established. \nFinancial Considerations is found for Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant failed to correctly answer Section 26 on his 2020 e-QIP. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. However, for \nthe following reasons, I find that they are unnecessary to apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial omissions on his 2020 e-QIP were a serious oversight; but I \nfind that he did not deliberately withhold this information from the Government, as he \nhad fully disclosed his delinquencies on his 2016 e-QIP. Therefore, as stated earlier, he \ndid not have any intent to deceive. Personal Conduct is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has a distinguished history \nof working in the defense industry, as testified to by his supervisor. (TR at page 16 line \n18 to page 33 line 2.) He performs well at his job. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct \nsecurity concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 62 years old and married to his second wife. He has two children and one stepchild. Applicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree. He has been employed by a defense contractor since September 2019 as a Manager and seeks to obtain or retain national security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment. (Item 2 at Sections 13A, 15, and 17.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Applicant admitted all the allegations under this guideline. The SOR alleged that Applicant has three debts that are past due, charged-off, or in collection, in the total amount of approximately $39,000. The existence and amount of these debts is supported by his admissions to all SOR allegations in his Answer and by credit reports dated November 25, 2020; and April 17, 2021.

As of November 21, 2021, Applicant \nhad not made any attempt to resolve this debt. In Applicant Exhibit A he stated, \u201cI fully \nintend to work with the listed company, Cavalry Portfolio Service to settle these debts.\u201d \nNo further information was provided. This debt is not resolved. \n1.c. Applicant admitted owing a charged-off debt to a cell phone provider in the \namount of $1,145. Applicant made a payment arrangement with the successor creditor \nand paid the debt in full in July 2021. This is confirmed by documentation from the creditor. \n(Applicant Exhibit A.) Accordingly, this allegation is found for Applicant. \nApplicant submitted no information concerning his current income or debts. He \nsubmitted no documentation detailing his plans for resolving the remaining past-due \nindebtedness. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national\nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.\nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under\nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest\nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has incurred over $39,000 in past-due indebtedness over the last several \nyears. He paid one of the debts alleged in the SOR. (SOR allegation 1.c.) However, the \nremaining two debts, totaling almost $38,000, are unresolved. These facts establish prima \nfacie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant \nto mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAs stated, Applicant provided evidence showing he had resolved the $1,145 debt \nset forth in SOR allegation 1.c. Accordingly, that allegation is found for him. \nThe evidence does not establish that any of the above mitigating conditions apply \nto Applicant\u2019s other two debts. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s medical issues, and his reasonable \nreaction to them, obviously had a serious impact on his finances. Those facts have been \nconsidered. However, that is only one part of the equation. Applicant did not provide any \nevidence showing that he is engaging in a good-faith effort to responsibly resolve the two \nremaining debts. A statement that he intends to work with the collection agency is not \nsufficient. As also stated, Applicant did not submit any financial information from which I \ncan make a finding that he is capable of avoiding additional delinquencies or resolving \nthese debts in a reasonable, responsible, and timely fashion. Paragraph 1 is found \nagainst Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nconcerns over his considerable past-due indebtedness. The potential for pressure, \nexploitation, or duress remains substantial. Overall, the record evidence creates \nsubstantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance at the present time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

At the time the SOR was issued Applicant was engaged to Ms. A. He has a high school education and has been employed by a defense contractor since 2007. (Answer; Item 3 at Sections 1-4, 12 and 13A.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has failed to meet his financial obligations and is therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 2 Specifically, the Government alleged that Applicant had not filed his 2015, 2017, or 2019 Federal tax returns as required. Applicant admitted the sole allegation under this guideline. He also submitted additional information to support the granting of national security eligibility. Applicant answered DOHA interrogatories on May 25, 2021. With regard to his tax situation he stated: For the years that I didn\u2019t file my taxes (2015, 2017, 2019) I was working overseas in [Country One] (2015), [Country Two] and [Country Three] (2017), and [Country Four] (2019).

With regard to his tax \nsituation he stated: \nFor the years that I didn\u2019t file my taxes (2015, 2017, 2019) I was working \noverseas in [Country One] (2015), [Country Two] and [Country Three] \n(2017), and [Country Four] (2019). I had difficulty with obtaining my W2s \noverseas and in the case of 2017, when I was living on . . . Island off of the \ncoast of Country Three, I had actually filled out my return but wasn\u2019t able to \ne-file it and I wasn\u2019t aware of any reliable way of mailing it from the village \nthere. I pre-paid $1,200 on my 2015 tax return because I knew I might have \ndifficulty getting taxes filed on time. For 2019 we had just merged with \nanother company and my W2, which was no longer available online, was \nnot sent to me in [Country Four]. I had planned to get all of my back taxes \ntaken care of when I returned to the States in 2020 but I just got so busy \nwith setting up two new . . . Training Centers and then getting Covid that it \nkind of got put on the back burner. On January 31, 2021 I got in contact with \na tax accountant from . . . Tax Services to get myself caught up. I am now \nall caught up on my tax returns through 2020. As an overseas worker I \nqualified for the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion during 2014, 2015, 2017, \n2019 and 2020. I knew that I would be getting a refund so there were never \nany financial concerns about my ability to pay my taxes. For tax years 2016 \nand 2018 I was back in the USA at tax time and I was able to file my returns \non time. (Item 5 at 2-3.) (See Item 3 at Section 11.) \nTurning to the specific tax years at issue: \n2015 - IRS records dated May 25, 2021, show that Applicant made an estimated \ntax payment of $1,200 on April 14, 2015, for the 2015 tax year.

(Answer \nat 35-39.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline B -  Foreign Influence) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for national \nsecurity eligibility because he has foreign contacts that may create circumstances in \nwhich the individual may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e (Ms. A) is a citizen the Philippines. She \nand Applicant are now married. He admitted this allegation in his Answer stating, \u201cMy \nfianc\u00e9e and now wife, is from the Philippines but she does not ask me about the nature \nof my work and I don\u2019t discuss it.\u201d \nApplicant first reported contact with Ms. A on his 2020 e-QIP under Section 19, \n\u201cForeign Contacts.\u201d At the time they met, in August 2019, Ms. A was living in Country \nFour, as was Applicant. He reported daily contact with her to his security officer at that \ntime. (Item 3 at Section 19.) \nApplicant was subsequently interviewed by an investigator from the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) on August 10, 2020. Applicant informed the investigator \nthat he was now engaged to Ms. A and intended to sponsor her entry into the United \nStates. Applicant further stated that he had reported his Ms. A to his security office. (Item \n4 at 3.) \nThe Philippines \nApplicant\u2019s wife is from the Philippines. Therefore, it is appropriate to examine the \nsituation with regard to the Philippines. The Philippines is a multiparty, constitutional \nrepublic. There are serious issues with terrorism in certain parts of the Philippines, and \nthe State Department recommends that American citizens not travel to those areas. \nDepartment Counsel submitted evidence that certain individuals were criminally \nconvicted for violating United States laws regarding exports of munitions. There are \nreports of human rights violations by parts of the Philippines government. \nThe Philippines has been a United States ally for many years, dating back to the \nsigning of the Mutual Defense Treaty on August 30, 1951. Most recently, an article from \nthe Defense Department website dated April 18, 2022, stated, \u201cSecretary of Defense \nLloyd J. Austin III and Philippine Defense Secretary Delfin N. Lorenzana met today at the \nPentagon to strengthen the deep alliance between the two countries.\u201d (Jim Garamone, \nU.S, Philippines Look at Ways to Strengthen Alliance, https://www.defense.gov/ \nNews/News-Stories/Article/Article/3002700/us-philippines-look-at-ways-to-strengthen-\nalliance/ (accessed July 10, 2022). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe United States/Philippines alliance was also the subject of the 9th United States-\nPhilippines Bilateral Strategic Dialogue.

We resolve \nto further fortify our mutual trust and respect, ensuring that the relationship \nremains relevant and mutually beneficial in the face of the changing \ngeopolitical landscape and the emergence of new challenges and \nopportunities, especially those brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. \n(Office of the Spokesperson, Department of State, Joint Vision for a 21st  \nCentury United States-Philippines Partnership, https://www.state.gov/joint-\nvision-for-a-21st-century-united-states-philippines-partnership/ (November \n16, 2021) (accessed July 10, 2022). \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file Federal income tax returns, as required, for tax years \n2015, 2017, and 2019. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing \ndisqualifying condition and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes one condition in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns: \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant had been delinquent in filing his tax returns due to the fact that he was \nliving overseas during tax filing season for those years and had difficulties filing the tax \nreturns. He did file his taxes in the intervening years because he was in the United States \nat tax time. The facts show that Applicant had prepared or filed all of his tax returns \nmonths before the date of the SOR, and had taken responsible steps to ensure that he \npaid more than sufficient funds to the IRS in advance of each of the pertinent filing \ndeadlines. Applicant fully mitigated the concerns over his income tax return issues. \nParagraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are arguably applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant\u2019s wife, formerly his fianc\u00e9e, is a citizen of the Philippines. The above \ndisqualifying conditions apply and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate them. \nThe Philippines has internal issues that may be of concern to the United States. \nAccordingly, Applicant\u2019s family connections to that country have the potential to generate \na heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion \nunder AG \u00b6 7(a). The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign \ncountry is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one \nrelative lives in a foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this \nfactor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially \nresult in the compromise of classified information. (See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).) \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country. \nApplicant\u2019s wife is from the Philippines, which is a major and long-standing United \nStates ally. While there is some concern over terrorism, Department Counsel has not \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubmitted any evidence that the government of the Philippines has attempted to influence \nor coerce Americans. Indeed, as recently as April of this year the Secretary of Defense \nhas reiterated the desire of the United States to improve relations with the Philippines. \nAlso of note is the fact that Applicant consistently and timely reported his growing \nrelationship with Ms. A while preparing his e-QIP, during an interview with OPM, to his \nsecurity office, and in his Answer to the SOR. Based on the available evidence the \npossibility of foreign influence in this case is minimal to none. Applicant has completely \nmitigated the security significance of his connections to the Philippines. Paragraph 2 is \nfound for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant provided sufficient \nevidence to show that he has resolved his tax issues, and that they will not recur in the \nfuture, and that they were under circumstances that negate resulting security concerns. \nHe has also mitigated any possible adverse foreign influence of his Filipino-born wife. The \npotential for pressure, exploitation, or duress has been resolved. Overall, the evidence \ndoes not create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and suitability for \na national security eligibility. Applicant has met his burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under the guidelines for Financial Considerations and Foreign Influence. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he denied all of the allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.q). Applicant is a 67-year-old employee of a DOD contractor who has worked as an engineer for the same employer since February 1984. His current annual salary is about $125,000, and his spouse earns approximately $10,000, after taxes, as a nail technician. Applicant earned two bachelor\u2019s degrees in 1980 and 1981, and two master\u2019s degrees in 1983 and 1995. He has held a DOD security clearance since 1984. He was first married in 1979, and subsequently divorced in 1994. He married again in 2006. He has four adult children and a 17-year-old son. (Tr. 16-26, 64-65; GE 1) Financial Considerations The SOR alleges 17 delinquent debts totaling approximately $71,000, of which 14 debts stem from unpaid medical accounts in the approximate amount of $25,420. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j, 1.l, 1.m, 1.p, and 1.q) Two debts are unpaid utility accounts totaling $267 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.n and 1.o), and the last debt is a delinquent mortgage account totaling $44,475. (\u00b6 1.k) All of the delinquent accounts are established by the credit reports in the record. Applicant stated that his financial problems arose in 2018 following his spinal surgery and six-month recovery. He was unable to properly maintain his financial obligations for several of his rental properties during this time. In 2021, he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, which he stated in a treatable type of blood cancer. (Tr. 27-35; GE 2-6) In August 2020, Applicant",

On June 24, 2022, DOHA received a copy of the transcript (Tr.). \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he denied all of the allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.q). \nApplicant is a 67-year-old employee of a DOD contractor who has worked as an \nengineer for the same employer since February 1984. His current annual salary is about \n$125,000, and his spouse earns approximately $10,000, after taxes, as a nail technician. \nApplicant earned two bachelor\u2019s degrees in 1980 and 1981, and two master\u2019s degrees in \n1983 and 1995. He has held a DOD security clearance since 1984. He was first married \nin 1979, and subsequently divorced in 1994. He married again in 2006. He has four adult \nchildren and a 17-year-old son. (Tr. 16-26, 64-65; GE 1) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges 17 delinquent debts totaling approximately $71,000, of which 14 \ndebts stem from unpaid medical accounts in the approximate amount of $25,420. (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j, 1.l, 1.m, 1.p, and 1.q) Two debts are unpaid utility accounts totaling $267 (\u00b6\u00b6 \n1.n and 1.o), and the last debt is a delinquent mortgage account totaling $44,475. (\u00b6 1.k) \nAll of the delinquent accounts are established by the credit reports in the record. Applicant \nstated that his financial problems arose in 2018 following his spinal surgery and six-month \nrecovery. He was unable to properly maintain his financial obligations for several of his \nrental properties during this time. In 2021, he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, \nwhich he stated in a treatable type of blood cancer. (Tr. 27-35; GE 2-6) \nIn August 2020, Applicant participated in a background interview with an \nauthorized Department of Defense (DOD) investigator. Applicant\u2019s 14 delinquent medical \ndebts from his May 2020 credit report were discussed. Applicant told the investigator that \nhe had paid every medical bill. He denied receiving any communication from any medical \nprovider that an account was overdue. (Tr. 43-46; GE 6) \nAt the hearing Applicant admitted that he may be responsible for some of the 14 \nunpaid medical accounts that were incurred in 2018. During that time, he had consulted \nwith approximately 30 doctors, endured surgery, and participated in physical therapy. (\u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a-1.j, 1.l, 1.m, 1.p, and 1.q) He surmised that some of the doctor consultations may \nhave been considered an out-of-network provider by his medical insurance, and not fully \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ncovered. He never contacted any of the medical creditors to determine whether he was \nresponsible to pay the outstanding balance. He admitted that he prioritized his physical \nrecovery over addressing and resolving his financial matters. He promised to pay all of \nthe outstanding bills that were his responsibility once he has fully recovered. (Tr. 35-42, \n76) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s August 2020 background interview, there were two foreclosures \nlisted on the credit report that were discussed. Applicant told the investigator that \nunbeknownst to him, the bank did not cash his checks for several months and initiated \nforeclosure proceedings on one of his rental properties. He consulted with an attorney \nand later decided to allow the property to go into foreclosure because it was located in a \ndeclining neighborhood. A second delinquent mortgage loan was reviewed with Applicant, \nand he denied that he had ever heard of this creditor. He also refuted that he owed any \nmoney after a different rental property was repossessed by the bank. (Tr. 43-46; GE 6) \nApplicant reiterated during the hearing that he did not owe the mortgage creditor \nalleged in the SOR in the amount of $44,475. (\u00b6 1.k) Applicant was asked if he knew the \nname of the bank that financed this particular rental property, but he could not recall. He \nwas also asked whether there was any deficiency balance owed to the bank after \nforeclosure, and Applicant could not recall that information either. Applicant was \nrequested to submit substantiating documentation to support his contention that he is not \nliable for this debt. No documentation was provided while the record was held open for \ntwo weeks. (Tr. 43-51) \nApplicant testified that he consistently remained current on all of his financial \nobligations until he suffered from medical complications beginning in 2018. Department \nCounsel submitted 11 judgments that had been entered against Applicant from 2000 to \n2017. The judgments were from the city\u2019s sewer district for unpaid sewer services \nprovided to his rental properties. Applicant stated that he had a good reason for not paying \nhis sewer bills in a timely manner. He purchased several rental properties from the late \n1990s to the early 2000s. Many of these properties required rehabilitation. If the electric \nor water bills were not paid on these properties, the services were soon disconnected. He \ndiscovered; however, that if he ignored the sewer bills, the sewer services continued \nwithout interruption. He was over-extended financially, and he discovered that postponing \nthese sewer payments allowed him to have additional money to use on the rehabilitation \nof these properties. (Tr. 51-65, 71-72; GE 6, GE 7) \nThe city\u2019s sewer district started garnishing Applicant\u2019s wages in about June 2001, \nbecause he failed to voluntarily pay these bills or satisfy the judgments. His pay was \ngarnished on multiple occasions to at least 2017, before his health declined. He stated \nthat he was not aware that his pay had been garnished on multiple occasions, and he \nwas uncertain whether his pay was currently being garnished. He admitted that he had \ndelinquent sewer bills as of the date of the hearing, but he did not know the amount. He \nsaid the overdue sewer accounts could possibly be related to about ten of his rental \nproperties, but he was unsure. He asserted that sewer expenses would be paid one way \nor another. For example, about eight years ago he sold a rental property, and the bank \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwithheld $16,000 to pay the city\u2019s sewer district before a check was provided to him. (Tr. \n51-65, 71-72; GE 6, GE 7) \nApplicant stated that only three or four houses were currently rented by tenants, \nbut the remaining rental properties were uninhabited and closed by him. He claimed that \nhis income was reduced by 50 percent due to the loss of rental income. He acknowledged \nthat he is currently working 40 hours a week from home and getting paid his full salary. \nHe intended to retire later this year. Department Counsel suggested that Applicant fill out \na personal financial statement (PFS). There were some unanswered questions about his \nfinances since there was no evidence in the record as to Applicant\u2019s salaried income, \nrental income, and monthly expenses, and he could not recall detailed information. \nApplicant did not provide a PFS by the time the record closed. (Tr. 35-42, 76) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had two overdue utility accounts with AT&T \ntotaling $267. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.n and 1.o) Applicant stated during his August 2020 background \ninterview that his youngest son may have used these services, but he would have to look \ninto the matter to determine if he was liable for them. At the hearing, Applicant denied \nresponsibility for these accounts and stated that he had no idea why these two delinquent \naccounts were listed on his credit report. He admitted that he has not communicated with \nany of the creditors alleged in the SOR, nor had he settled, paid, or made arrangements \nto pay on any of the delinquent debts. (Tr. 75-85) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation.

Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to\nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The SOR alleges 17 delinquent debts totaling approximately \n$71,000, which are supported by the credit reports in evidence. The record establishes \nthe disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about \nthe possible applicability of mitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying \nconditions is contained in the mitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant established several circumstances beyond his control, which adversely \naffected his finances; however, he did not establish that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. In 2018, he suffered a back injury that required surgery and physical \ntherapy. It took him about six months to recover. Thereafter, he soon suffered other \nailments that continue to the present time. Applicant admitted he has prioritized his \nphysical recovery over addressing and resolving his financial delinquencies. He currently \nworks 40 hours a week; however, there is no evidence of a debt-resolution plan or \nsignificant steps in furtherance of such a plan. However, \u201c[e]ven if applicant\u2019s financial \ndifficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his [or her] \ncontrol, the judge could still consider whether applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005). \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-\n0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).    \nThere is no requirement that an applicant immediately resolve all financial issues \nor make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan and \ngood-faith efforts to pay delinquent debts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time, is \nsufficient. An applicant\u2019s mere promises to pay debts in the future, without further \nconfirmed action, are inadequate. In this case, Applicant has not initiated a responsible \nfinancial plan or made any good-faith efforts to resolve his delinquent accounts. His \npromise to pay his outstanding financial obligations at some point in the future is \nineffective and holds little value. \nApplicant did not provide a monthly budget, PFS, or other documentation about \nhis financial resources, or show he has acted responsibly in addressing his financial \ndelinquencies. The combined salaries of his and his spouse totaled in the six-figure range. \nAt the hearing, he admitted that he is currently delinquent in paying for the sewer services \nprovided to his rental properties. As such, there is insufficient assurance or supporting \ndocumentation in the record that his financial problems are under control and will not \nrecur in the future. Under all the circumstances, Applicant failed to establish mitigation of \nthe financial considerations security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nAlthough Applicant did provide some mitigating information of circumstances \nbeyond his control, he did not overcome the security concerns raised by his financial \ndelinquencies. He did not provide documentation about why he was unable to make \ngreater documented progress resolving any of the delinquent SOR debts. Applicant has \nnot initiated a responsible financial plan or made any good-faith efforts to resolve his \ndelinquent accounts. His financial history raises unmitigated questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.

He has a 12-year-old child from the marriage. \n(Transcript (Tr.) at 13-16; GE 1) \nApplicant attributed his alcohol issues at least partially to PTSD and dealing with \nthe effects from his two combat deployments. By 2013, he was drinking almost every \nday. He was arrested in January 2016 and charged with driving while impaired (DWI). \nHe pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three days in jail, a fine, and court costs. (Tr. at \n17-21; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1) \nApplicant was arrested in September 2019 and charged with DWI with a blood \nalcohol concentration (BAC) of more than .15%. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced \nin March 2021 to fines, costs, and probation. (Tr. at 10-11, 21-28, 36; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1, 2) \nShortly after his arrest in September 2019, Applicant entered a veterans \ntreatment program for PTSD and alcohol use disorder. He reduced his alcohol \nconsumption throughout his treatment until he stopped drinking in March 2021. He \nreceived treatment from the program through about May or June 2022. His therapist \n(M.A., LPC (licensed professional counselor), LCDC (licensed chemical dependency \ncounselor)) wrote in October 2021 that Applicant was \u201cextremely engaged and \nconsistent with his treatment.\u201d He made significant progress and displayed an \nawareness of the negative impact his previous alcohol use had on his wellbeing. The \ntherapist concluded: \n[Applicant] has developed healthier coping strategies for managing his \nPTSD symptoms as well as coping strategies for managing his urges to \nuse alcohol. He has displayed an increased ability to express difficult \nemotions related to his past trauma and effectively manages these \nemotions without the use of alcohol. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) \nApplicant went through a court-monitored veterans program (separate from the \nprogram discussed above) as part of his probation. He is required as a condition of his \nprobation to abstain from alcohol. He completed therapy and group sessions under the \nprogram. The court certified that he graduated from the program in March 2022, and he \ncompleted the aftercare program in October 2022. His probation runs to about March \n2023.

He later admitted that he violated his probation in June 2022 by drinking.1  He \nstated he had significant stressors, including the death of his brother-in-law, and he had \nabout four beers. He was required to write a \u201cthink piece\u201d to the court explaining what \nhappened, and the court increased his monitoring, He has been abstinent since June \n2022 and plans to remain sober. He relies on the skills he learned through therapy and \na strong support system through his friends and family. (Tr. at 10, 12, 17, 32-37, 48) \nThe SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling about $15,475, including $3,841 \nin child support arrearages. The debts are established through credit reports and \nApplicant\u2019s admissions. \nApplicant has been paying $1,060 a month since October 2017 toward his child \nsupport. Part of each payment goes to the arrearages. (Tr. at 12, 37-40; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR) \nApplicant settled the $6,020 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.b with a $5,500 payment in \nDecember 2021. He paid the $2,565 (SOR \u00b6 3.c) and $1,842 (SOR \u00b6 3.d) debts. He \ncontacted the Defense Finance and Accounting Service about the $1,210 debt (SOR \u00b6 \n3.e), but the agency was unable to locate the debt. His current finances are stable as \nverified by a recent credit report with no adverse entries. (Tr. at 12-13, 16, 40-46; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE B, C) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n1 Any matter not alleged in the SOR will not be used for disqualification purposes. It may be considered in \nassessing Applicant\u2019s credibility, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in the whole-person \nanalysis. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant was arrested for DWI in 2016 and 2019. He received treatment for a \ncondition diagnosed as alcohol use disorder. It is unclear who made the diagnosis, but it \nwas confirmed by an M.A., LPC, LCDC. The above disqualifying conditions are \napplicable. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant attributed his alcohol issues at least partially to PTSD and dealing with \nthe effects from his two combat deployments. His service to this country is \ncommendable and is given considerable weight. He received extensive counseling for \nPTSD and alcohol use disorder. His second DWI was in September 2019, more than \nthree years ago. However, he remains on probation until about March 2023, and he \nviolated the terms of that probation in June 2022 by drinking. None of the mitigating \nconditions are sufficient to overcome concerns about his alcohol abuse, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand  \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related arrests were cross-alleged under criminal conduct. He \nis on probation until March 2023. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe discussion above under alcohol consumption applies equally here. He \nviolated probation in June 2022 by drinking. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct continues to \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. The above mitigating conditions, individually or \ncollectively, are insufficient to alleviate those concerns. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including child support arrearages \nand delinquent debts. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant paid or otherwise resolved all of the delinquent debts. His current \nfinances are stable as verified by a recent credit report with no adverse entries. His \nfinances do not cast doubt on his current judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information. Security concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F, G, and J in my whole-person analysis. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s honorable military service, his combat deployments, and \nhow that service contributed to his alcohol and legal problems. However, Applicant \nviolated probation in June 2022, and he remains on probation until March 2023. The \nprotection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires \nthat \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns, but he did not mitigate the \nalcohol consumption and criminal conduct security concerns. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.e: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",
