Bohn, Attorney At Law\nOctober 28, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing,\n(e-QIP) on August 7, 2008.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On May 11, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe security concerns under Guideline H for Applicant. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 2, 2009, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on July 8, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on July 13, 2009,\nscheduling the hearing for August 20, 2009.  The Government offered two exhibits,\nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 and 2, which were received without objection.\n\n2\nApplicant offered ten exhibits, referred to Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through J and testified\non his own behalf.  The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on August 28, 2009.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 23 years old, unmarried, and has a Bachelors Degree in\nEngineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Radar Signaling Processing\nEngineer, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement). The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs.\nThe Applicant graduated from college in May 2008, and has been working for his\ncurrent employer for the past thirteen months.  He testified that during his freshman\nyear in college, in April 2005, he started using marijuana.  Many of the students used it\nand it was readily available.  The effects of the drug increased his appetite, he felt \u201ccool\u201d\nand he enjoyed it.  Marijuana did not adversely affect his grade point average.  His\nfrequency of marijuana use varied from as much as two to three times a week, to as\ninfrequently as one to two times a month.  Government Exhibit 2, a statement from a\npersonal interview of the Applicant, indicates that he used marijuana approximately 120\ntimes.  He restricted his use of marijuana to social occasions at college.  He obtained\nthe marijuana from fellow students.  On at least ten occasions he purchased it for his\nown use.  (Tr. p. 31).  He last used marijuana in May 2008.  (Tr. p. 30). \nAt the time he was using marijuana, he did not foresee any negative\nconsequences, although he knew it was illegal.  The Applicant has not used any\nmarijuana since starting his current employment.  (Tr. p. 34).  He testified that he has no\nintentions of ever using any illegal drug again.  (Tr. p. 47).  He has decided that he no\nlonger wants to use marijuana or any illegal drug again because he could lose his job.\nHe now has a job, an apartment, auto insurance and responsibilities and wants to\nmaintain an independent lifestyle as an adult.  (Tr. p. 39).\nThe Applicant also consumed mushrooms on three occasions between\nNovember 2007, and March 2008.  He tried them because he heard it would be crazy\nwith psychedelic effects, hallucinations and real intense things.  (Tr. pp. 38-39).  He\nenjoyed the experiences.  \n    \nThe Applicant also used valium without a prescription as a college sophomore in\nJune 2006.  He explained that he was peer pressured by one of his roommates.  He\nbelieves that the pill had no effect on him.  \nIn June 2008, the Applicant underwent a company drug test and the results were\nnegative.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits H and I).  \n\n3\nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s program manager and\ncoworkers, attest to his good character, work ethic and honesty.  They believe that he\nhas learned from his mistakes of the past and that he has greatly matured since college.\nThey have never witnessed the Applicant under the influence of any illegal drug or\nalcohol.  He is highly recommended for a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A, B, C\nand D).   \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisal of 2008, reflects overall that he \u201cfrequently\nexceeds expectations.\u201d (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F).  \n     \nApplicant has received a certificate for completing a security awareness and\neducation course administered by his company in February 2009.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nE).\nApplicant, in coordination with his company security officer, prepared and signed\na memorandum dated August 18, 2009, wherein it indicates that if the Applicant is found\nto be in violation with of the Department of Defense or his company drug policy, or if he\nviolates the policies, he must report the incident to the security office.  The company will\nthen notify DISCO of the incident and DISCO my take action by revoking the Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity clearance.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J).\nApplicant has a 401(k) with his employer that is increasingly growing.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G).  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\n24. The Concern. Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n25.(a) any drug abuse;\n25.(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\n\n4\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n26. (b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:\n(1) disassociation form drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;\n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any\nviolation.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\n\n5\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d                                              \n      \nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in drug abuse that demonstrates poor judgment or\nunreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has  engaged in drug involvement (Guideline H).  The totality of this evidence\nindicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\nBecause of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus\nor connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is not sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guideline H of the SOR.\nThis is a close case.  However, the evidence shows that the Applicant\u2019s history of\nillegal drug use is recent.  He used marijuana, mushrooms and valium without a\nprescription during college, from 2005 to 2008, and up until he obtained his current\nemployment.  He believes that he has greatly matured since college, however, he is still\nvery young and immature.  He appears to now recognize the negative effects the use of\nillegal drugs has on his job and his ability to adequately protect classified information.\nHowever, there is no track record to demonstrate that he can remain drug free and that\nhe will not succumb to peer pressure.  Although he states that he has no intentions of\nusing any illegal drugs in the future, he has only been drug free for thirteen months.\nGiven this short period of abstinence, I am not certain that he will remain drug free.  At\n\n6\nthis time, the Applicant is not eligible for a security clearance.  If he can continue to\nremain drug free, at some point in the future, he may be eligible for a security clearance,\nbut not now.  His last use of illegal drugs occurred in 2008, just last year, and  prohibits\na favorable determination in this case.     \nUnder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, Disqualifying Conditions, 25(a) any drug\nabuse, and 25(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution or possession of drug paraphernalia apply.  Mitigating\nCondition 26(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1)\ndisassociation form drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the\nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a\nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation\narguably applies, but under the particular circumstances of this case falls short and is\nnot mitigating given the extent of his illegal drug use, his insufficient period of\nabstinence, and his immaturity and youth.  I find his past use of illegal drugs to be\nrecent and of security significance.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant is just 23 years old.\nAlthough he is intelligent and educated, he is also young and immature.  He last used\nillegal drugs in 2008, and now states that he has no intentions of using it in the future.\nSufficient time has not passed to demonstrate that he will remain drug free.  Under the\nparticular facts of this case, the totality of the conduct set forth under all of the\nguidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole person assessment of poor judgement,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, a lack of candor, an unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations, and/or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard classified information.  \nThis Applicant has demonstrated that he is not trustworthy, and does meet the\neligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find against\nthe Applicant under Guideline H (Drug Involvement).       \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.                                                            \n                                                                 \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\n\n7\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Mendez, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nApril 23, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on March 29, 2007.  (Government 4.)  On August 10, 2009, the Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines H, G and E for Applicant. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on September 8, 2009, in which\nhe elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) to\nthe Applicant on October 14, 2009.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information\nin rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the\nFORM on October 22, 2009, and he submitted no reply.  The case was assigned to the\n\n2\nundersigned for resolution on January 11, 2010.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 29 years old.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a\nGraphics Specialist, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.\nDepartment Counsel, pursuant to Paragraph E.3.1.13. of DoD Directive 5220.6,\nmoved to amend the Statement of Reasons by striking portions of the original SOR.\nSpecifically, to strike subparagraph 2.d in its entirety, and in subparagraph 3a, to strike\nthe language \u201cand 2d\u201d.  Applicant made no objection.  Said amendments were so\nordered.  \nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nhis personal background during the clearance screening process.  \nThe Applicant admitted each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nguideline.  The Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for National Security\nPositions (e-QIP) on March 29, 2007.  Question 24(a), asked him if since the age of\nsixteen or in the last seven years which is shorter, had he used any illegal substance?\nThe Applicant answered, \u201cNO.\u201d  (Government Exhibit 4.) This was a false answer.  The\nApplicant failed to list that he used marijuana from about 1999 to about 2006.\n(Government Exhibits 3 and 5.)  \nQuestion 24(c), asked him if in the last seven years, had he been involved in the\nillegal purchase, manufacture, trafficking, production, transfer, shipping, receiving, or\nsale of any narcotic depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen, or cannabis for his own\nintended profit or that of another?  The Applicant answered, \u201cNO.\u201d  (Government Exhibit\n4.)  This was a false answer.  The Applicant failed to list that he had purchased and sold\nmarijuana from about 2001 through about 2006, as set forth below.  (Government\nExhibits 3 and 5.)      \nThe Applicant completed the security clearance application in March 2007, less\nthan a year since his last admitted drug use.  He told the government investigator that\nhe failed to disclose his drug sales history because he was never charged or arrested.\n(Government Exhibit 5.)  The question does not ask about arrests or convictions, merely\nif an Applicant has been involved in the illegal purchase or sale.  (Government Exhibit\n4.)      \nParagraph 2 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement). The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs.\nThe Applicant admitted each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nguideline.  The Applicant used marijuana twice in high school in 1999.  His marijuana\n\n3\nuse increased in college to about two to three times per month.  He states that he\nlimited his marijuana use to the weekends, and continued using it until at least April\n2006, after leaving college.  During this period, the Applicant purchased the marijuana\nfor his own use, or obtained it from his roommate.  He states that he used marijuana out\nof boredom and it was just something to do before going out and partying with friends.\n(Government Exhibit 5.)\nFrom 2001 to 2006, the Applicant became involved in the sale and distribution of\nmarijuana.  In 2001, while attending college, he met an individual (A) who sold him 5\npound increments of marijuana.  Applicant would in turn break it up into smaller\namounts, usually 1/4 ounce to sell at the university and in the surrounding areas.\nApplicant estimates that he sold marijuana to three to five persons per weekend from\nhis apartment.  Applicant used the proceeds of his drug sales for general entertainment\nactivities and to buy marijuana for his own use.  (Government Exhibit 5.)  \nIn April 2006, Applicant\u2019s friend (A), was arrested and charged with Conspiracy to\nDistribute and Possess With Intent to Distribute Cocaine and Possession with Intent to\nDistribute Cocaine resulting in significant prison time and forfeiture of significant assets.\n(Government Exhibit 6.)  As a result of (A)\u2019s arrest, the Applicant was admittedly\nbrought in for questioning by the FBI in late 2006, and questioned regarding his\ninvolvement in the buying and selling of drugs.  Applicant has not admitted any cocaine\ndrug sales and states that he did not know the details of A\u2019s drug operation.  Applicant\nstates that his last contact with A was in April 2006 and has had no further contact with\nhim since then.         \nParagraph 3 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal activities. \nThe Applicant admitted each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nguideline.  The Applicant deliberately sought to conceal his marijuana use from 1999 to\n2006, and his purchase and sale of marijuana from 2001 to 2006.  By intentionally\nconcealing this information from the Government on his security clearance application\nof March 2007, he violated federal law, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, a\nfelony.   \nThe Applicant admits that he has made a series of poor decisions in the past.  He\nregrets his actions and is now trying to move forward with his life in a positive direction.\nHe is going back to school, and redirecting his life and has no desire to ever engage in\nthe criminal activities of the past.  He states that he is trying to reconcile his former\ntransgressions.  (Government Exhibit 3.)  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\n\n4\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16. (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\nThe Concern. Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair\njudgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n25.(a) any drug abuse;\n25.(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\n25.(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n30.  The Concern.  Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability,\nand trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\n\n5\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n31.(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; \n31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole-person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  The Administrative\n\n6\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in drug abuse, alcohol abuse and poor personal conduct that\ndemonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has falsified his security clearance application, (Guideline E), has a history of\ndrug involvement (Guideline H), and criminal conduct (Guideline J).  The totality of this\nevidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the\nApplicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there\nis a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines E, H and J of the SOR.  \nThe Applicant intentionally failed to disclose his marijuana use, and his purchase\nand sale, in response to questions 24.(a) and 24.(d) of his security clearance application\nof March 2007.  Under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, Disqualifying Condition 16.(a)\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities applies.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.\nConsequently, I find against the Applicant under Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  \n\n7\nThe evidence also shows that the Applicant used, purchased and sold marijuana\nfor profit as recently as 2006, and was questioned by the FBI regarding this illegal\nconduct.  Under Guideline H, Drug Involvement, Disqualifying Conditions 25.(a) any\ndrug abuse, 25.(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale or distribution, or possession of drug paraphernalia, and\n25.(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance apply.  None of the\nmitigating conditions are applicable.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement. \nThe Applicant\u2019s use, purchase and sale of marijuana is criminal and dangerous.\nBy falsifying his security clearance application, the Applicant violated federal law, Title\n18, United States Code, Section 1001, a felony.  Under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct),\nDisqualifying Conditions 31.(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, and\n31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted apply.  None of the mitigating\nconditions are applicable.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline J,\nCriminal Conduct.   \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole-person assessment of poor judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, a lack of\ncandor, an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \nThis Applicant has demonstrated that he is not trustworthy, and does not meet\nthe eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline H (Drug\nInvolvement), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).     \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the SOR.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \n\n8\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 3: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nSamuel Bluck, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 3, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\n\n2\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On December 31, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Henry Lazzaro\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to consider record\nevidence favorable to Applicant; whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was erroneous; and\nwhether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nFinding no error, we affirm.  \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:  Applicant is a research analyst and\nwriter for a Defense contractor.  He enlisted in the Navy.  He subsequently attended college on a\nROTC scholarship and served in the Navy as a commissioned officer.  He retired as an 0-4, having\nbeen approved to leave the service about one year in advance of his actual retirement date. \nApplicant\u2019s first marriage ended in divorce, and his ex-wife died in 2006.  He remarried in\n2007 and has a four-year-old stepson.  After retiring from the military, Applicant experienced a\nperiod of underemployment, which affected his financial condition.\nApplicant has significant delinquent debt for credit cards, medical treatment, and a\nrepossessed recreational vehicle (RV).  He had intended to live in the RV following his retirement.\nHowever, after he retired, he did not make enough money to make payments on the RV, and it was\nrepossessed.  At the close of the record he owed over $27,000 for the vehicle.  He also has at least\nfour delinquent debts not listed in the SOR, the balance owed on them being approximately $16,000.\nHe has entered into repayment plans for these debts.\nApplicant considered filing for bankruptcy protection, but an attorney advised him that he\nmade too much money for Chapter 7, and he did not want to pursue Chapter 13.  Applicant\u2019s net\nmonthly salary is approximately $4,000.  He also receives a monthly payment of $2,900 in military\nretirement.  Although he has a positive cash flow each month, he cannot account for how the\nremainder of his income is spent.  Applicant held a security clearance while on active duty, with no\nincident or concern.  He enjoys an excellent reputation for the quality of his character.\nIn the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge explicitly considered Applicant\u2019s honorable\nservice in the Navy and his good security record.  However, he concluded that Applicant\u2019s decision\nto retire from the military without first reducing his debt or obtaining adequate replacement income\nreflected poorly upon his judgement.  \u201c[C]onsidering the disregard he has demonstrated since retiring\nfrom the Navy for keeping his financial affairs in order and the continuing disregard he has shown\nfor resolving the financial problems he is experiencing, I find the whole person analysis is\ninsufficient to overcome the financial considerations concern that exists.\u201d  Decision at 7.  \nIn support of his appeal, Applicant has cited to other Appeal Board cases which he contends\nsupport his case for mitigation.  We give due consideration to them.  However, we conclude that they\n\n3\nare distinguishable from Applicant\u2019s.  Unlike the prior cases, in this one the Judge reasonably\nexplained his conclusion that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by his own actions and\nthat he had not demonstrated sufficient attention to resolving his problems.  Moreover, each case\n\u201cmust be decided upon its own merits.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider all the record evidence.  Applicant cites\nto evidence that he suffered financial loss when a mobile home he owned was destroyed.  He also\ncites testimony that he experienced some financial pressure due to his having cared for his ex-wife\nduring her final illness.  However, a Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the\nrecord.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553\nat 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  Applicant\u2019s argument is not sufficient to rebut this presumption, in\nview of the totality of the record evidence.  We conclude that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis\ncomplies with the requirements of Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1, in that the Judge considered the totality of\nApplicant\u2019s circumstances in reaching his decision.  See ISCR Case No. 08-02464 at 3 (App. Bd.\nJul. 16, 2009); ISCR Case No. 05-03948 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 21, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-09959\nat 6 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006).   \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

He has failed to take any action to resolve most of the debts listed in the\nStatement of Reasons (SOR), and his testimony and the evidence he presented give little\nreason to anticipate he will resolve those debts in the foreseeable future. Clearance is\ndenied.\nOn June 3, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an\nSOR to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The SOR alleges a security\n1\nconcern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant submitted a response to\nthe SOR, dated July 6, 2009, admitted all SOR allegations except the allegation contained\nin subparagraph 1.b, and requested a hearing.\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nDecember 31, 2009\n\n2\nThe case was assigned to me on September 9, 2009. A notice of hearing was\nissued on October 9, 2009, scheduling the hearing for October 26, 2009. The hearing was\nconducted as scheduled. The government submitted six documentary exhibits that were\nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6 and admitted into the record without objection.\nApplicant testified and submitted 14 documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits (AE) 1-14 and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was\nreceived on November 4, 2009.     \nProcedural Matters\nFollowing the close of the record in this case, I received an envelope, postmarked\nDecember 19, 2009, containing: \n1) an unsigned note from Applicant, dated December 18, 2009 (AE 15); \n2) an unsigned letter from Applicant, dated December 17, 2009 (AE 16); \n3) an unsigned letter from Applicant\u2019s wife, dated December 16, 2009 (AE 17); \n4) a list of creditors, dated December 17, 2009 (AE 18); \n5) a letter from one of Applicant\u2019s creditors, dated December 17, 2009 (AE 19); \n6) a payment receipt from one of Applicant\u2019s creditors, dated December 17, 2009 (AE 20);\n7) a note from Applicant\u2019s wife, dated December 17, 2009 (AE 21); and \n8) a credit report, dated December 15, 2009 (AE 22). \nThe documents were marked as indicated above.\nDepartment Counsel submitted a memorandum in which he points out that AE 15-\n22 were submitted after the close of the record and the submission of these documents\nis therefore untimely. However, he also specifically stated he did not object to the\ndocuments being admitted into evidence. Accordingly, AE 15-22 are admitted into the\nrecord without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s memorandum has been marked as\nAppellate Exhibit (App. Ex.) I, and is included in the record.\n  \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 48-year-old man who has been employed as a research analyst and\nwriter by a defense contractor since August 2008. From August 2004 until February 2008,\nhe worked with his brother installing heating and air conditioning equipment. He was\nunemployed from February 2008 until August 2008.\n\n3\nApplicant graduated from high school in May 1979. He enlisted in the Navy in May\n1981, and he served as an enlisted Sailor until he was given a Navy Reserve Officer\nTraining Corps scholarship in August 1986. He attended college from August 1986, until\nhe was awarded a bachelor of science degree in history and commissioned as an ensign\nin the Navy in November 1989. After commissioning, Applicant attended flight school to\nbecome a Naval Flight Officer but he was unable to complete the training due to a medical\ncondition. He then became a surface warfare officer and served as such until he retired as\na lieutenant commander in August 2004.\nApplicant decided to retire at the time he did because he realized he would not be\npromoted to commander because he had failed to attend certain training. However, he\ncould have remained on active duty for at least two more years as a lieutenant\ncommander. Applicant submitted his request to retire from the Navy about one year in\nadvance of his actual retirement.\nApplicant was first married in January 1982. That marriage ended in divorce in\nJanuary 2000, and his ex-wife died in April 2006. No children were born of the marriage.\nApplicant\u2019s first wife was also a retired Naval officer and, as a result, she did not receive\nany part of his military pension when they divorced. Applicant has been remarried since\nAugust 2007. He has a four-year-old stepson from this marriage. \nApplicant purchased a recreational vehicle in August 2001, at a cost of\napproximately $43,500. He had intended to live in the vehicle on some vacant land he\nowned after his retirement. Applicant was current on the payments on the vehicle while he\nwas in the Navy, but he was unable to continue making the payments after he retired and\nfound himself underemployed. The vehicle was repossessed in February 2008, and there\nis now a $27,325 deficit owing after the resale of the vehicle. Applicant has not made any\npayments on this debt.\nThe SOR alleges a credit card debt, owing in the amount of $5,037, that was\ncharged off as a bad debt. Applicant\u2019s credit bureau report (CBR), dated April 9, 2009,\ndiscloses $1,453 was past due on that account as of the date of that CBR. The date of last\nactivity on this account is listed in that CBR as September 2007. Applicant\u2019s CBR, dated\nDecember 15, 2009, discloses the past due amount has increased to $2,095. Applicant\nsubmitted a note, dated December 17, 2009, in which he claims to have entered into a\nrepayment agreement with this creditor. However, he did not submit any verification of that\nalleged agreement or any proof that he had actually made a payment in accord with the\nalleged agreement.\nThe SOR alleges a second credit card debt, owing in the amount $6,655, that is\nlisted in Applicant\u2019s CBR, dated September 26, 2008, as over 120 days late. The date of\nlast activity is listed in that CBR as January 2008. Applicant submitted verification that he\nmade one $100 payment on this account on December 17, 2009.   \nThe SOR alleges a medical bill that has been submitted for collection in the amount\nof $2,476. Applicant\u2019s CBR, dated April 9, 2009, indicates this account dates back to\nOctober 2007. His CBR, dated December 15, 2009, discloses this account was transferred\nto a collection agency as of December 2008, and the past due amount had increased to\n\n Applicant crossed out the entry in this CBR that listed the account as a medical bill and wrote a note about\n2\nhaving made a payment arrangement with a gasoline charge card company. However, the account number listed in the\nCBR, dated December 15, 2009, is identical to the account number listed in the CBR, dated April 9, 2009. \n4\n$2,620.  Applicant denies he is responsible for this bill and claims to have no knowledge\n2\nof how it came to be listed in his credit report. He has had health insurance through the\nmilitary since he retired and now has additional health insurance through his current\nemployer. He admits his stepson has recurring medical problems that require treatment but\nasserts that treatment should be covered by one or both of his health insurance carriers.\nHe has not disputed this account through the credit reporting agencies nor has he done\nanything else to either satisfy or challenge the account.\nApplicant has at least four accounts not listed in the SOR that were severely\ndelinquent. He has entered into repayment plans on those accounts and is making the\nagreed upon payments. The balance owing on those accounts is approximately $16,000.\nApplicant attributes his financial problems to his having acquired substantial debt\nwhile on active duty in the Navy that he was unable to remain current on after he retired.\nHe thought he would earn more money working with his brother in the heating and air\nconditioning business than he did. When he figured out he could not earn enough to pay\nhis debts he unsuccessfully sought other employment for several years until he was hired\nby his current employer. His financial problems increased when a mobile home he had\npurchased was destroyed by a tornado. While insurance paid for the trailer, he had to\nobtain a federal emergency loan to clean up the property the trailer had been on before he\ncould sell the property. He is now paying $108 a month on that loan which has a balance\nowing of almost $8,000.\nApplicant spoke with an attorney about filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection last\nyear. The attorney advised him that he earned too much money to file for Chapter 7\nprotection and instead recommended that he seek Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection.\nApplicant decided he did not want to pursue the Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Applicant has not\nobtained any financial counseling nor has he attempted to establish a budget. He admits\nhe lacks the ability to manage his finances and he has no plan to resolve his inadequacy\nin this area.\nApplicant\u2019s net monthly salary is approximately $4,000. He additionally receives\nabout $2,900 each month in retirement pay. He submitted a personal financial statement\nin which he listed his monthly living expenses as $2,450, and his monthly debt payments\nas $730. He valued his total assets at $2,250. He does not have any savings and he\ncannot account for where the rest of his income is spent. However, although Applicant\u2019s\nwife does not work, she does maintain separate accounts which she pays from Applicant\u2019s\nincome. He does not know what accounts she has or what amount of money she spends\non them.   \n  \nApplicant\u2019s Certificate of Release from Active Duty (DD 214) discloses his Naval\nawards include a Joint Service Commendation Medal, five Navy and Marine Corps\nCommendation Medals, three Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals, and a Good\nConduct Medal. He possessed a security clearance, including a top secret clearance with\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at 3 (citations omitted).\n6\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at 2.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n5\nsensitive compartmented information (SCI) access, for most of the time he was on active\nduty. There is no information to indicate he ever mishandled or risked the compromise of\nclassified information while possessing a security clearance. \nApplicant  submitted letters of recommendation from a neighbor and several co-\nworkers. Each of those persons attest to his outstanding good character and believe he\ncan and should be entrusted with access to classified information.\nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Each clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial decision based upon the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6\nof the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or\nagainst clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be\nfollowed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Guideline F\n(financial considerations), with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant\nin this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n6\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n7\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n10\n Id. at 531.\n11\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n12\n6\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant owes $27,325 on the deficit remaining after the sale of his repossessed\nrecreational vehicle. He has two delinquent credit card debts owing in the total amount of\n$11,692. He has a medical debt that has been submitted for collection owing in the amount\nof $2,476. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\nand DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.\nApplicant acquired substantial debt while he was on active duty that he was able to\nservice with his active duty pay. However, he freely chose to retire at least two years earlier\nthan he had to without either reducing his debt or acquiring sufficient replacement income\nto remain current with his debt payments after his retirement. Instead, he opted to work\nwith his brother without determining if he would be able to earn enough to pay his bills. As\na result, Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(a): the behavior . . . occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and MC 20(b): the conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances do not apply.\nApplicant made a $100 payment on a delinquent debt that is listed in the SOR about\ntwo months after the hearing. He has been making payments on several debts that are not\nlisted in the SOR. He submitted a letter verifying he has entered into a repayment\nagreement with a creditor that is not listed in the SOR, but he did not submit proof that he\nhas actually made a payment to that creditor. It will be many years before he has satisfied\nthe debts on which he has been making payments, and he has no plan to make any\npayments on three of the debts listed in the SOR until after he has satisfied the ones he\nis now working on.\n\n7\nApplicant admits he is unable to properly manage his finances, but he has not\nsought out any assistance in dealing with his financial problems other than to obtain a\nrecommendation that he seek Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection which he rejected. Finally,\nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement discloses that he should have substantial\ndiscretionary income to apply to his debts, but he has no idea where that money is being\nspent. I have considered MC 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for\nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; and MC 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts and conclude they do not apply.  \nApplicant disputes the medical debt based on his having health insurance that he\nbelieves would have paid for any medical treatment he, his wife, or his stepson would have\nreceived. This debt predates Applicant\u2019s current employment, so the only possible\ninsurance coverage would have been through his military insurance. However, this debt\narose only two months after Applicant married his current wife and he failed to submit any\nproof that he timely added his wife and/or stepson to his military insurance. Further, he has\nnot taken any meaningful action to resolve or dispute this debt. Accordingly, MC 20(e): the\nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is\nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the\ndispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue does not apply.\nApplicant is entitled to substantial consideration under the whole person concept for\nthe many years that he served honorably in the Navy and the many awards he received\nin recognition of his outstanding Naval career. Additionally, he has a proven track record\nof being entrusted with access to classified information, including SCI, without a blemish.\nThe letters of recommendation he submitted attest to his reputation as a trustworthy and\nhonorable man. However, considering the disregard he has demonstrated since retiring\nfrom the Navy for keeping his financial affairs in order and the continuing disregard he has\nshown for resolving the financial problems he is experiencing, I find the whole person\nanalysis is insufficient to overcome the financial considerations concern that exists.     \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant failed to mitigate the\nfinancial considerations security concern. He has not overcome the case against him nor\nsatisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-d:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

She submitted a second application on June 5, 2008 (SF 85P #2).  On \nSeptember 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B \nJune 11, 2010\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n(Foreign Influence) and Guideline C (Foreign Preference). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 30, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On February 18, 2010, DOHA assigned the \ncase to me. On February 25, 2010, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing setting the case \nfor March 26, 2010. The case was heard as scheduled.  Department Counsel offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 into evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified and called four witnesses. She offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through N into \nevidence without objection. The record remained open until April 16, 2010, to give \nApplicant an opportunity to submit additional information. On April 9, 2010, Applicant \nsubmitted three documents that were marked as AE O, P, and Q. I admitted them into \nevidence without objection.

After finishing \ncollege, she worked at an Iranian university in the field of information technology from \nJuly 1991 until June 1996. (Tr. 90.)  \n \n \nApplicant immigrated to the United States in 1996. At the time, her parents were \nliving here. From October 1996 to January 2000, she worked as a programmer for a \nprivate company. (GE 2.) From January 2000 to June 2004, she worked as a director of \ndevelopment for another private company. In May 2002, she earned a master\u2019s degree \nin computer science from a U.S. university.  (Tr. 85.) She became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen in September 2002 and obtained a U.S. passport in October 2002. (GE 2.) \n \n \nApplicant began employment with a federal contractor in July 2004, as a software \ndevelopment manager. Her annual salary is $106,000. (Tr. 102.) She owns a house and \n\n \n \n \n \n3\ncondominium in the United States. (Tr. 103.) She contributes to a 401(k) retirement plan \nthrough her employer. (Tr. 104) Her assets total approximately $687,000 and are \nlocated in the United States. She does not have any assets in Iran. (Tr. 104; GE 3 at \n23.) She does not receive any form of pension or retirement benefits from Iran. (Tr. \n102.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents were born in Iran. Her father worked as an accountant for a \ngovernment agency from October 1960 to May 1980. Her mother taught school from \nJuly 1964 to June 1984. (GE 3.) They moved to the United States in 1990 and later \nbecame U.S. citizens. They reside with Applicant, who provides their financial support. \n(Tr. 88.)  They do not receive any monies from the Iranian government. They do not \nown property in Iran. (Tr. 103.) They do not have active Iranian passports. (Tr. 86.) The \nlast time they traveled to Iran was in 2008 with Applicant. (Tr. 89.) \n \n \nApplicant has one sister, who was born in Iran. She is a naturalized U.S. citizen, \nresiding in the United States. (Tr. 87.) At this time, she has two cousins, who are \ncitizens and residents of Iran.  One of them works for a pharmaceutical company and \nthe other owns an orchard. (Tr. 101.) They have telephone contact a couple times a \nyear. (GE 2 at 11, 12.) She visited them on her trips to Iran. One of her Iranian cousins \nis studying in Sweden. Another Iranian cousin immigrated to the United States with his \nwife. (Tr. 100-101.) Her aunts and uncles live in the United States. (Tr. 100.) \n \n \nApplicant has two friends from college who are Iranian citizens. (Tr. 96.) One of \nthem works for a private company there. They have not spoken for about a year, but \nhave emailed one another over the years. (GE 3 at 8.) She visited her in 2008. (Tr. 98.) \nAnother college friend lives in Dubai. She is married to U.S. immigrant, and is waiting to \nmove to the United States. They email one another occasionally.  (Tr. 97.)   \n \n \nApplicant renewed her Iranian passport in November 2007, which is valid until \nNovember 2012. (GE 4 at 2.) She did so, in order to enter Iran, which will not recognize \nany foreign passport for an individual born in Iran. (GE 3.) After becoming a U.S. citizen, \nshe used that passport to enter and exit Iran in January 2004, March 2006, and April \n2008. (Tr. 92.) She has not used that passport for travel to any other country. (Tr. 92.) \nOn a couple trips, her parents accompanied her. All of them stayed with family or \nfriends. (Tr. 93.) In Interrogatories that Applicant completed in July 2009, she indicated \nthat she was willing to destroy the passport, if necessary. (Id. at 28.) On April 6, 2010, \nApplicant\u2019s employer destroyed her Iranian passport. (AE P, O.) She is willing to \nformally renounce her Iranian citizenship, but does not know how to legally do so. (Tr. \n94-95.) She has no intention to return to Iran in the future. (Tr. 76.) Her closest friends \nare no longer there and it is dangerous to visit Iran. (Tr. 105.) \n \n \nFour witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant, all of whom work for her \nemployer. The vice-president of operations, a retired Army colonel, has daily contact \nwith Applicant. He previously held top secret clearances and now holds a secret \nclearance. As a former military officer, he understands the security clearance process \nand security concerns. He is aware that Applicant\u2019s Iranian background and passport \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nhave raised concerns. He does not question her loyalty and considers her performance \nto be \u201cunequivocally outstanding.\u201d (Tr. 30.)  He believes that should she be confronted \nwith having to choose between a relative or a friend in Iran and American interests, she \nwould choose the United States. (Tr. 31, 16-28.) The vice president of the reserve \nhealth readiness program testified.  He has worked with Applicant at both her current \nand previous place of employment. He has a secret clearance. He considers her a \u201cvery \ntrustworthy individual. And I wouldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t believe that 100 percent. \u201c(Tr. 41; \n36-42.)  \n \n \nThe director of event management testified. He met Applicant in February 2005. \nHe considers her to be honest and a person of high integrity. He has no reason to \nbelieve that she should not have access to sensitive information. (Tr. 47; 43-53.)  \nAnother former employer testified. He met Applicant 15 years ago, when she applied for \na position in 1996 with a company he co-founded.  He now works for her current \nemployer and is her direct supervisor. Based on his observation of her over the years, \nhe believes she is loyal to the United States and prefers it to Iran. (Tr. 57; 56-65.) \n \n \nApplicant submitted copies of her 2007, 2008 and 2009 performance evaluations. \nAppellant\u2019s performance appraisal reflected that she consistently met the expected \nstandard of the critical elements of her job and often exceeded the standards.  (AE L, N, \nand M.) She also submitted recommendation letters from eight co-workers. All of the \nletters compliment her work ethic and integrity. (AE B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I.)   \n \n \nApplicant expressed her loyalty to the United States. She stated, \u201cThere is no \nquestion or no, really no doubt in my mind about the preference that I have between \nU.S. and Iran. I mean U.S. is where I live and I want to live. And that\u2019s where I came to \nlive to have this life.\u201d (Tr. 111.) \n \nIran \n \n \n \nIran is a constitutional Islamic republic with a theocratic system of government in \nwhich Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures, and ultimate political \nauthority is vested in a learned religious scholar. The U.S. has not had diplomatic \nrelations with Iran since 1980. 1 \n \n \nThe U.S. Government has defined the areas of objectionable Iranian behavior as: \n(1) Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction; \n(2) Its support for and involvement in international terrorism; (3) Its support for violent \nopposition to the Middle East peace process; (4) Its dismal human rights record; and (5) \nIran\u2019s intervention in the internal affairs of Iraq.2 The U.S. has designated and \n                                            \n1 U.S. Department of State, Background Note: Iran, dated March 2010. \n \n2 Id.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\ncharacterized Iran as the most active state sponsor of terrorism. Iran provides critical \nsupport to non-state terrorist groups.3 \n \n \nThe government of Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses \nagainst the Iranian people. Abuses include political killings and incarceration; summary \nexecutions, including of minors; disappearances; religious persecution; torture; arbitrary \narrest and detention, including prolonged solitary confinement; denial of due process; \nsevere restrictions on civil liberties - speech, press, assembly, association, movement \nand privacy; severe restrictions on freedom of religion; official corruption; violence and \nlegal and societal discrimination against women, ethnic and religious minorities, and \nhomosexuals; trafficking in persons; and child labor.4  \n \n \nThe State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens to consider carefully the \nrisks of travel to Iran. U.S. citizens who were born in Iran and the children of Iranian \ncitizens, even those without Iranian passports who do not consider themselves Iranian, \nare considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities, since Iran does not recognize dual \ncitizenship. Therefore, despite the fact that these individuals hold U.S. citizenship, under \nIranian law, they must enter and exit Iran on an Iranian passport, unless the Iranian \ngovernment has recognized a formal renunciation or loss of Iranian citizenship. U.S.-\nIranian dual nationals have been denied permission to enter and depart Iran using their \nU.S. passports; they even had their U.S. passports confiscated upon arrival or \ndeparture. U.S.-Iranian dual citizens have been detained and harassed by the Iranian \ngovernment. Iranian security personnel may place foreign visitors under surveillance. \nHotel rooms, telephones and fax machines may be monitored, and personal \npossessions in hotel rooms may be searched.5 \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.) \u201cThe standard that must be met for . \n. . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \n \n                                            \n3U.S. Department of State, State Sponsors of Terrorism, April 30, 2009.  \n \n4U. S. Department of State, 2009 Human Rights Report: Iran, Country Reports on Human Rights \nPractices, dated March 11, 2010.  \n \n5 U.S. Department of State, Travel Warning: Iran, dated July 1, 2009. \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he \napplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] \ndecision.\u201d \n \n \nA person who applies for access to sensitive information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information.  \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201c[a]ny determination under this \norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified \nor sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, and then he or she may be prone \nto provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests \nof the United States. \nAG \u00b6 10 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; and  \n (b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen. \nApplicant was born in Iran. She arrived in the United States in 1996 and became \na naturalized U.S. citizen in September 2002. She obtained a U.S. passport in October \n2002. In November 2007, she renewed her previously issued Iranian passport, which \nshe was able to do because she was born in that country. Renewing her passport was \nan action she took in order to obtain recognition of Iranian citizenship, so she could \ntravel there. In January 2004, March 2006, and April 2008, she used that passport to \nenter and exit Iran. She possessed that current passport until April 2010, when it was \ndestroyed. These facts are sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nAfter the Government raised a potential disqualification, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to establish any appropriate mitigating condition. AG \u00b6 11 provides three \nconditions that could mitigate those concerns: \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n (b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; and \n (e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nApplicant\u2019s previous Iranian citizenship was based on her parents\u2019 citizenship \nand her birth in Iran. Applicant expressed her willingness to formally renounce her \nIranian citizenship during the hearing, but does not know how to legally do so. In April \n2010, she surrendered her current Iranian passport to her employer, who then \ndestroyed it. She has no intention to return to Iran. Accordingly, the above mitigating \nconditions provide mitigation of the security concerns that were raised. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;6 and, \n (b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \nSince leaving Iran, Applicant periodically telephones two cousins, residing in Iran. \nBoth are citizens of Iran. She also contacts a college friend periodically.  Applicant\u2019s \nconnections to these two family members and one friend could create a potential \nconflict of interest between her security obligations and desire to help them, only in a \n                                            \n6 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of \nlaw, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nsituation wherein they were taken hostage or otherwise threatened with harm if she did \nnot cooperate with terrorists or their governments. None of these people have \nconnections with the Iranian government or have positions in which they could \notherwise benefit from her access to sensitive information or technology. However, \nunder either disqualifying condition, security concerns in this case could arise in \nconnection with the potential that hostile forces might seek protected information from \nApplicant by threatening harm to her family members and her long-standing friend who \nare citizens of and reside in Iran.  \n  \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these disqualifying conditions, \nand the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of the \nresulting security concerns. AG \u00b6 8 provides three conditions that could mitigate the \nabove security concerns:  \n (a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nIn this case, Applicant has contact with two cousins and one friend, who are \nresidents and citizens of Iran. The current positions and activities of those people do not \ninvolve the government or military and they would have no interest in acquiring \nprotected information. However, her relationships and contact with them potentially \ncreate a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because terrorists \nin Iran seek intelligence and are hostile to U.S. interest. Their physical presence in Iran \ncreates the potential that their well-being could be threatened to the point that Applicant \nwould confront a choice between safeguarding their interests versus those of the United \nStates. Hence, AG \u00b6 8(a) has limited application to the raised security concerns.   \n \nApplicant produced significant evidence establishing AG \u00b6 8(b). Based on her \nrelationship and depth of loyalty to the United States, she can be expected to resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the United States. She has lived in the United States \nsince 1996 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2002. She received an advanced \ndegree from a U.S. university. Her parents are U.S. citizens, residing in the United \n\n \n \n \n \n10\nStates with her. Her sister and other family members are citizens and residents of the \nUnited States. She owns property and holds bank accounts in the United States. Her \nU.S. assets total more than over $600,000 and no financial interests in Iran. She has \nlimited contact with two cousins and friend, residing in Iran. She is a valued employee at \nher current position, earning a good salary and accolades from her employer.   \n \nSince leaving Iran, Applicant has maintained ongoing, albeit sporadic, \ncommunication with two cousins and one friend in Iran. She visited them in 2002, 2004, \n2006, and 2008. Hence, AG \u00b6 8(c) cannot apply, as those contacts have been \nsufficiently frequent and not casual over the years.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a public trust position must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. The Appeal \nBoard requires the whole-person analysis address \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s personal \nloyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family ties to the U.S. relative to his [or \nher] ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the U.S.; and many others \nraised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, \n2007).   \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Four circumstances weigh against \nApplicant in the whole-person analysis.  First, there is a significant risk of terrorism and \nhuman rights abuses Iran. More importantly for security purposes, terrorists are hostile \nto the United States and actively seek classified information. Terrorists could attempt to \nuse Applicant\u2019s two cousins and friend to obtain such information. Second, she had \nnumerous connections to Iran before she immigrated to the United States in 1996. \nFollowing her birth, she spent her formative years there. She was educated at an \nIranian university where she subsequently worked for several years. Third, two cousins \nand one friend are citizens and residents of Iran. Fourth, she visited friends and family \n\n \n \n \n \n11\nin Iran in 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008, using her Iranian passport for three of those trips \nafter becoming an American citizen. \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant access to \nsensitive information. She is a mature person, who has lived in the United States for 13 \nyears, and has been a naturalized citizen for seven years. Her parents have lived in the \nUnited States since the early 1990s and subsequently became U.S. citizens. They \nreside with her. Her only sibling is a naturalized U.S. citizen and resident. Her aunts and \nuncles are U.S. citizens and residents, as are some of her cousins. Her familial and \nfinancial ties to the United States are much stronger than her ties to two cousins and \none friend residing in Iran.  She is successfully working for a federal contractor, as \nimpressively documented by her supervisors\u2019 testimony and numerous letters of \nrecommendation from other colleagues. The witnesses that testified at her hearing \nuniformly believed Appellant to be dependable, honest, trustworthy, and dedicated to \nher job. None of the witnesses had any reservations about Applicant having access to \nsensitive information. She credibly asserted her allegiance to the United States and \ndesire to renounce her Iranian citizenship. Her Iranian passport was destroyed and she \ndoes not intend to return there. There is no derogatory information about her in the \nrecord. \n \nOn balance, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to fully mitigate reliability \nand trustworthiness concerns arising under the guidelines for foreign preference and \nforeign influence. Overall, the record evidence leaves no doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present \neligibility and suitability for a public trust position. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:           For Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n12\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.  Eligibility for access to ADPI/II/III is granted. \n \n \n                                  \n \n          \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Applicant\u2019s use of illegal substances began at the age of 14, with marijuana. It escalated at age 17 or 19, and led to his use of methamphetamines. He used methamphetamines from approximately 1995 through 2007; benzodiazepines, a prescription drug he misused, from approximately 1994 to February 2007; codeine, a prescription drug he misused, from 1994 through 2006; and opioids, a prescription drug he misused, from 1994 to 2007; and cocaine once in approximately 1996, despite the fact that he knew it was against the law to take illegal substances and misuse prescription drugs.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 14, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nH, Drug Involvement; J, Criminal Conduct; and E, Personal Conduct . The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases after \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 17, 2010, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 22, 2010. DOHA issued \na notice of hearing on August 16, 2010, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on \n\n \n2 \n \nSeptember 8, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were \nadmitted without objection. The Applicant offered Exhibit (AE) A, called five witnesses, \nand testified on his own behalf. The record was left open for the submission of \nadditional documentation and on September 23, Applicant submitted 26 pages, marked \nAE B. Department Counsel had no objection to AE B and it was admitted. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 16, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, through 1.g., 1.i. through 1.m., \n2.b., and 3.a. through 3.c. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h., and 2.a. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Applicant\u2019s use of \nillegal substances began at the age of 14, with marijuana. It escalated at age 17 or 19, \nand led to his use of methamphetamines. He used methamphetamines from \napproximately 1995 through 2007; benzodiazepines, a prescription drug he misused, \nfrom approximately 1994 to February 2007; codeine, a prescription drug he misused, \nfrom 1994 through 2006; and opioids, a prescription drug he misused, from 1994 to \n2007; and cocaine once in approximately 1996, despite the fact that he knew it was \nagainst the law to take illegal substances and misuse prescription drugs. Applicant \nexplained that he got into drug use because he had problems with self-worth and self-\nesteem. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 4; Tr. 60-65, 98, 107-110.) \n \n \nAt age 19, in April 2003, he was arrested and charged with Felony Possession of \na Controlled Substance and Possession of Smoking Device. Applicant pled guilty to \nPossession of a Controlled Substance and was placed on a deferred entry of judgment \nfor a period of 18 months. On this occasion, Applicant was in a vehicle that ran out of \ngas on the side of the road. A police officer stopped and asked for identification. The \nofficer conducted a search of the vehicle and found paraphernalia in the vehicle. \nApplicant maintained approximately six months of sobriety after this arrest. (GE 1; GE 2; \nGE 5; GE 6; Tr. 66-68, 99-101, 109.) \n \n \nApplicant was also charged with reckless Driving with Bodily Injury in May 2003. \nHe had made an unsafe lane change and ran another vehicle off of the road. Applicant \nreceived a summons to appear in court in the mail. He pled guilty to the charge and he \nentered a deferral program where he was fined $140 and placed on probation for 36 \nmonths. He abstained from methamphetamine use during the beginning of his term on \nprobation, but resumed its use prior to the termination of probation. (GE 2; GE 5; Tr. \n102-104.) \n \n \nApplicant was treated at a residential in-patient drug treatment facility for 30 days \nfrom November to December of 2003. Applicant successfully completed the \nrehabilitation program. When he left the program, he fully intended to abstain from the \nuse of alcohol and illegal substances. He was successful in abstaining from drugs and \nalcohol for approximately one year. However, as time passed, he began to feel hat he \nwas \u201ctoo young\u201d to have a problem with addiction and gradually returned to consuming \n\n \n3 \n \nalcohol when he turned 21. His alcohol consumption led him back to drugs. (GE 1; Tr. \n109-110.) \n \n \nApplicant began working for a defense contractor in February of 2006. At that \ntime, he applied for a security clearance and was granted an interim clearance in early \n2006. He was aware of both his employer\u2019s policy against drug use and the \nGovernment\u2019s policies against drug use, and he attempted to refrain from using illegal \nsubstances. However, he was unable to abstain for long, and soon found himself using \nillegal substances including methamphetamines again. In July 2006, co-workers \nwitnessed Applicant with drug paraphernalia in the workplace and confronted him. He \nwas referred to the employee assistance program, which referred him to outpatient \ntreatment. He was also subjected to a drug test by his employer. Applicant failed that \ndrug test and was terminated by his employer. His drug use increased after his \ntermination. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 51, 81, 104.) \n \n \nApplicant received outpatient treatment in August 2006, but he failed to \nsuccessfully complete it. He was unable to make himself get to his outpatient classes. \nHe continued to use illegal substances. (Tr. 68-69, 81-84.) \n \n \nIn February 2007, Applicant was arrested and charged with Under the Influence \nof Controlled Substances, Possession of Controlled Substances, and Possession of \nSmoking Device. He was convicted of Possession of a Controlled Substance. Applicant \nclaims he was traveling with people who had paraphernalia, \u201cand stuff,\u201d including \nprescription medications not prescribed to Applicant in the car. They got pulled over. \nThe car was searched and paraphernalia was discovered, and they \u201cput it on \n[Applicant].\u201d Applicant was sentenced to one year probation, with the stipulation that he \nhave no further arrests and he was required to attend out-patient drug treatment. (GE 1; \nGE 2; GE 5; GE 6; Tr. 84-86, 104.) \n \n \nApplicant attended a drug and alcohol treatment facility for 21 days from \nFebruary 14, 2007 to March 8, 2007. He was diagnosed with Chemical Dependency to \ninclude amphetamine dependence and sedative dependence. Prior to his 2007 \ntreatment, he had made four prior attempts to stop using drugs, but his attempts were \nunsuccessful and he eventually relapsed. However, he successfully completed the \ntreatment program in 2007, and has abstained from drugs and alcohol since entering \ntreatment. At the time of discharge, his prognosis was \u201cgood-providing client maintains \n12-step meetings and follows [medical] after care plan.\u201d (GE 2; GE 3; AE B; Tr. 71-77.) \n \n \nAfter completing treatment, Applicant chose to move into a sober-living \nenvironment, on the same city block as the treatment center, with 12 other people for \none year. During that year, he attended five to six 12-step meetings per week and \nvisited the treatment center on a daily basis. He realized that alcohol is a drug and that \nhe needed to abstain from alcohol use. He presented a letter from the sober-living \nhouse that noted he was \u201can ideal tenant.\u201d He was drug tested on a weekly basis, the \nentire time he lived there, and required to attend at least 4 12-step meeting per week. \nAfter a successful year at the sober-living house, he moved into a shared apartment \nwith others from his treatment program. He now lives with his parents, who are very \n\n \n4 \n \nsupportive of his sobriety. Applicant still attends 12-step meetings three to five times per \nweek. (AE B; Tr. 58-59, 71-76.) \n \n \nApplicant has not used any illegal substances or misused prescription drugs \nsince February 2007. Further, he has not associated with any drug users since \nFebruary 2007. He attributes the success of his treatment program in 2007 to the \nsupport he got after treatment. His pledge not to use illegal substances again is \ncredible. He speaks publicly about his drug problem, goes to hospitals, and does house \ncalls, to speak about rehabilitation. He has sponsored six to ten other men in a 12-step \nprogram. He does volunteer activities with the treatment facility including visiting Skid \nRow and feeding the homeless there. He takes 12-step meetings to the jails and tries to \nhelp others that need help. He now uses the gym, his spirituality, and sporting events to \nfill his time productively. (AE A; Tr. 58-59, 63, 69-70, 75, 112-120.) \n \n \nIn May 2008, Applicant was rehired by the same defense contractor, after a year \nof sobriety. He was subject to a probationary employment period of one year, during \nwhich time he underwent random drug urinalysis tests. He presented documentation \nthat shows he passed each test. Further, he voluntarily submitted to a drug test on \nSeptember 14, 2010, to verify he is still drug free. He presented documentation of this \ndrug test showing he tested negative for illegal substances. Since May 2008, Applicant \nhas received no disciplinary write-ups. In fact, he received performance awards in \nOctober 2008 and January 2009, and an Employee Suggestion Award in January 2009. \n(AE A; AE B; Tr. 87-91.) \n \n \nApplicant has the support of his supervisors and colleagues. His witnesses and \ncharacter letters attest to the change Applicant has undergone since he was rehired in \nMay 2008. He is now considered to be a dedicated and reliable worker who is \nconscientious about his work. One supervisor opined Applicant \u201calways displays a high \ndegree of integrity, responsibility, and ambition; his work ethic was top notch.\u201d \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s uncle and father testified about Applicant\u2019s accomplishments \nand commitment to remaining sober. (AE A; AE B; Tr. 10-30, 123-141.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n\n \n5 \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to Drug Involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \n \nI have considered all of the evidence in this case and the disqualifying conditions \nunder Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 25 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) any drug abuse; \n \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; \n\n \n6 \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence; \n \n(f) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by \na duly qualified medical professional; and  \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance. \n \n \nThe Government presented sufficient information to support all of the factual \nallegations under Guideline H (SOR 1.a.-1.m.). Applicant used illegal substances from \napproximately 1994 through 2007. His drug uses lead him to treatment on three \noccasions and resulted in a diagnosis of chemical dependency. He continued his drug \nuse, as established by failed urinalysis administered by his employer, despite being \ngranted an interim security clearance in 2006. The facts established, through the \nGovernment\u2019s information and through Applicant\u2019s admissions, raise a security concern \nunder all of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nI have considered all of the evidence in this case and the mitigating conditions \nunder Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 26 and especially considered the following: \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate \nperiod of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nApplicant used illegal drugs over a period of 13 years, which is a considerable \namount of time. He also has relapsed back into drug use after treatment in the past. \nHowever, since 2007, he has demonstrated a firm commitment to abstaining from the \nuse of illegal substances. He no longer associates with drug users and he has \ncompletely changed his environment since he used drugs. He now surrounds himself \nwith people focused on recovery. He voluntarily participated in an inpatient treatment \nprogram in 2007 and was given a \u201cgood\u201d prognosis, if he followed up with after care. He \ndid in fact participate in after-care, choosing to live in a sober-living house for a year \nafter his treatment. He continues to go to 12-step programs weekly. He not only devotes \nhis efforts to remaining sober, but he volunteers in many activities to help others in their \nefforts to maintain sobriety. Applicant has demonstrated in the past three years that he \nis committed to a sober life style and has not had any relapses since 2007. AG \u00b6 26(b) \nand (d) apply. \n\n \n7 \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \nApplicant has a history of criminal offenses including his illegal drug use, his April \n2003 arrests, his May 2003 arrest, and his 2007 conviction. The above disqualifying \nconditions have been established.  \n \nTwo Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of criminal behavior. However, his offenses occurred \nwhen he was young and less mature. Three years have passed since his last offense. \nDuring that time, he has committed himself to sober living. He attends 12-step meetings \nseveral times a week, surrounds himself with people committed to a sober lifestyle, and \nhas redeemed himself in the eyes of his employer. His supervisors support Applicant\u2019s \napplication and speak highly of Applicant. Due to the recent, positive changes in \nApplicant\u2019s life, further Criminal Conduct is unlikely to recur. He has demonstrated that \nhe has successfully rehabilitated himself. His past criminal behavior does not cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) \napply. \n \n\n \n8 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s past drug use and criminal behavior, to include using illegal \nsubstances, after being granted an interim security clearance, demonstrates \nquestionable judgment. AG \u00b6 16(e) applies. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \n \n \nApplicant has been sober for over three years now. His co-workers, supervisors, \nfamily, and friends are all aware of his past problems with drugs. He conducts public \nspeaking engagements about sobriety, and works publically to assist others in getting \ntreatment. Applicant is committed to sober living, and has demonstrated that his past \ndrug and criminal involvement does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. Further, he has successfully rehabilitated himself \nand has taken steps to avoid ever using drugs in the future, including continuing to \n\n \n9 \n \nattend his 12-step program several times a week. He is unlikely to return to his criminal \npast including the use of illegal substances. AG \u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H, J, and E in my whole-person analysis. Independent of my analysis \nunder those Guidelines, I find that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns under \nthe whole-person concept. \n \nApplicant\u2019s life has drastically changed in the past three years. He has accepted \nthat he has a chemical dependency, and has worked hard to maintain sobriety. He had \na serious drug problem, but has dedicated himself to his recovery. He surrounds himself \nwith good influences and helps others to fight their addictions. These changes, as \nattested to by Applicant\u2019s friend, uncle and father, are permanent. The potential that he \nwould be subject to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is unlikely, given his \nlifestyle choices since February 2007. There is little likelihood of recurrence as Applicant \nhas taken his after care responsibilities seriously and his prognosis is good.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Drug Involvement, Criminal Conduct and Personal \nConduct security concerns.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.c.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nJune 24, 2011\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on August 13, 2008. (Item 4.) On August 6, 2010, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed security concerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement) and E\n(Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on August 31, 2010, and requested a\ndecision without a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Material\n(FORM) to Applicant on December 16, 2010. Applicant received the FORM on\nDecember 27, 2010, and was given 30 days to submit any additional information.\nApplicant submitted additional information on January 15, 2011, which was not objected\nto by Department Counsel and is entered into evidence as Applicant Exhibit A. The\n\n2\ncase was assigned to me on February 3, 2011. Based upon a review of the pleadings\nand exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 32, recently married with a child, and has also recently received a\nbachelor\u2019s degree. (Applicant Exhibit A.) He is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement)\nThe Government alleges under Guideline H that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has used illegal drugs. He admitted all the allegations in the\nSOR. (1.a. through 1.l.) Those admissions are deemed findings of fact. His admissions\nand responses to DOHA interrogatories are incorporated into the findings. (Items 5, 6.) \nApplicant admits that he used illegal drugs from about 1996 until May 2006. His\nprimary drug of choice was the prescription drug Oxycontin, which he used from 2001 to\nMay 2006. (1.b.) During that same period he also illegally purchased and used\nmethamphetamines and methadone. (1.c. and 1.d.) From 1996 through 1998 Applicant\nused marijuana on multiple occasions. (1.a.) Applicant stopped all drug use in May 2006\nand has not used any illegal drugs since that time. Applicant states that he does not\ncurrently use drugs and has no desire or intent to use drugs in the future. (Applicant\nExhibit A.)\nApplicant was arrested for drug-related offenses in 1998 and 2001. The 1998\narrest was for Possession of a Controlled Substance, Less than 20 grams of Marijuana\nand Possession of a Controlled Substance. He pled nolo contendere to the charges,\nwas sentenced to probation for one year and fined. (1.l.) (Items 8 and 9.)\nThe December 2001 arrest was for Possession of a Controlled Instrument and\nCriminal Intent to Commit a Controlled Substance Crime. In that case, Applicant\nattempted to buy Oxycontin using a forged prescription. He pled guilty to Obtaining\nDrugs by Fraud and was sentenced to five years in prison, suspended pending\ncompletion of a Diversion Program. (1.k.) (Items 10, 11 and 12.)\nApplicant attended the Diversion Program from June to August 2002. (1.j.) While\nworthwhile, Applicant was unable to shake his addiction at that time. (Items 13 and 14.)\nIn 2003, he again attended a drug treatment facility. (1.i.) This treatment was of\nshort duration, and was also unsuccessful as Applicant was not ready to face his\naddiction. (Item 15.)\nFinally, in 2006, Applicant was ready to take the major steps necessary to\ncombat his addiction. From May to November 2006 he successively received intensive\ninpatient treatment, intensive outpatient treatment and finally he lived for three months\n\n3\nin a halfway house. (1.f., 1.g. and 1.h.) At the conclusion of his intensive outpatient\ntreatment Applicant was given a good prognosis. (Items 16, 17 and 18.)\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nGovernment alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance\nbecause he has made false statements during the clearance screening process.\nRegarding both allegations under this paragraph Applicant stated in his Answer, \u201cADMIT\n-the answers were false, but not done intentionally.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)\nQuestion 23.d. of Applicant\u2019s e-QIP asks whether he had ever been charged with\nor convicted of any offense related to alcohol or drugs. Applicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d This\nwas a false answer to a relevant question about his prior drug history. Applicant stated\nin Applicant Exhibit A that this was a mistake on his part, and not done with intent to\ndeceive. He was not a veteran, had never worked for the Federal Government or a\ngovernment contractor before, and was very confused when filling out the form. He\ncould not find a supervisor to talk to, and mistakenly listened to a co-worker who said\nthat he only had to go back seven years on the form. \u201cI should have asked more\nquestions because I wasn\u2019t familiar with security clearances.\u201d Applicant also informed\nthe government investigator of the 1998 arrest during his interview two months later The\ninvestigator did not know about that arrest. Applicant further stated:\nI also was under the belief that my records were expunged or\nsealed. My attorneys were paid a lot of money to have this done in the\npast and they always told me I could answer NO to application questions\nregarding criminal history. I know now that all of this is irrelevant and I was\nsupposed to disclose everything, but all these things made me feel\njustified in my response on the SF86. (Applicant Exhibit A at 4.)\nQuestion 24.a. asks Applicant about his drug use history in the seven years prior\nto filling out the form. He said, \u201cYes.\u201d In addition, he specified his use was from \u201c01/2004\n(estimated)\u201d to \u201c06/2006 (estimated);\u201d that he used drugs 25 times. He also stated that\nthe drug was \u201cPrescription Pain Medicine. I had a prescription for some, but these I did\nnot have a prescription for. I sought and completed substance abuse treatment.\u201d The\nGovernment alleges this statement was false because Applicant did not specifically set\nforth that he used Oxycontin, methamphetamines, methadone, Lorcett, Vicodin and\nother prescription medications.\nMitigation\nApplicant submitted documentary evidence showing that he is a highly respected\nperson and employee. Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A contains letters from government\nemployees Applicant works for. All are extremely laudatory of the Applicant. \nThe Chief Business Management Branch, who has known him two and half\nyears, states that Applicant \u201cis very [conscientious] and takes pride in the performance\nof his duties.\u201d She further states that Applicant was appointed as the Physical Security\n\n4\nOfficer and Information Assurance Security Officer \u201cbased on his outstanding character\nand attention to details.\u201d (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 6.)\nThe Chief, IA Compliance Branch, who has known Applicant four years, states\nthat Applicant \u201cdemonstrates integrity by keeping his promises, doing what he says and\ntreating everyone in a fair and equitable manner.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit A at 7.)\nAn IT Specialist, who has worked with Applicant three years, says that Applicant\nis an \u201cextremely reliable, and honest young man.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit A at 8.)\nFinally, the Logistics Manager at the center where Applicant works, who has\nknown him ten months, says, \u201cI know [Applicant] to be honest, dependable and\ncourteous.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit A at 9.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his or her own\ncommon sense, as well as knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\n\n5\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of\ncompromise of classified information. It is also true that DOHA proceedings are not\ndesigned to punish Applicants. Rather, they are designed to assess whether an\nApplicant can be trusted at the present time and in the future to properly safeguard\nclassified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by the President in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nAG & 24:      \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a\nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nDrugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed\nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or\ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2)\ninhalants and other similar substances; Drug abuse is the illegal use of a\ndrug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved\nmedical direction.\n\n6\nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 25 \nand especially considered the following:  \n(a) any drug abuse; and\n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\nThe Applicant used prescription drugs, primarily Oxycontin, on a regular basis\nending in May 2006. He also used marijuana from 1996 to 1998. I find that both of the\nabove disqualifying conditions apply. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6\n26 and especially considered the following: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1)\ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or\navoiding the environment where drugs are used; (3) an appropriate period\nof abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation; and\n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program,\nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements,\nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional.\nApplicant\u2019s abuse of prescription drugs, primarily Oxycontin, occurred five years\nago. He engaged in a long-term process involving three different treatment regimens in\n2006 to resolve his addiction. He was successful, as is shown by the \u201cgood\u201d prognosis\nhe received and his five years of sobriety. The documentary evidence in the record\nshows Applicant has matured, that he has a credible and sustainable long-term\ncommitment not to use drugs in the future and he is now eligible for a security\nclearance. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG & 15:      \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest in any failure to provide\n\n7\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe following Disqualifying Condition is arguably applicable:\n16.a. deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nWith regards to his questionnaire, the evidence shows that Applicant did not\nintentionally falsify this document. Turning first to question 23.d., it appears that\nApplicant\u2019s failure to respond to this question was a combination of poor advice from co-\nworkers, poor advice from his attorneys and his own naivete with regards to filling out\ngovernment questionnaires. He was fully forthcoming during his interview with a\ngovernment investigator, which occurred in October 2008, two months after he filled out\nthe questionnaire in August.\nQuestion 24.a. concerns Applicant\u2019s use of drugs. He admitted using prescription\ndrugs without a prescription in 2004. Oxycontin, his drug of choice, is a prescription\ndrug. In reality, all of the other drugs Applicant used in this time frame are also\nprescription drugs. While his answer could have described his drug use in greater detail,\nhe put the Government on notice that he had used drugs and that he had undergone\ndrug abuse treatment.\nBased on all the available evidence, the following Mitigating Condition applies:\n17.c. the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior\nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\nApplicant\u2019s government co-workers, who have known him for several years, find\nhim to be a trustworthy and believable person. Based on the totality of the evidence, I\nfind that Applicant did not deliberately falsify his answers on the Government\nquestionnaire. Paragraph 2 is found for the Applicant.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\n\n8\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. My Guidelines H and E discussion\napplies here as well. Applicant engaged in drug use that ended about five years ago,\nafter he engaged in an extensive bout of treatment. He is respected at his place of\nemployment, credibly states he shall not use drugs in the future, and has shown that he\ndid not deliberately falsify his questionnaire. The record shows that he has matured,\nunderstands the nature of his conduct, and credibly shows that such conduct will not\nhappen in the future.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct was serious, but there is considerable evidence of\nrehabilitation. Based on the state of the record, I find that there have been permanent\nbehavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). Accordingly, at the present time, I find that\nthere is no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)); and\nthat there is no likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts about\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his Drug\nInvolvement and Personal Conduct. On balance, I conclude that Applicant has\nsuccessfully overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a DoD security\nclearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.l.:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b.:\nFor the Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F on August 28, 2009. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nFebruary 4, 2010\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cThat burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009),\n(concurring and dissenting, in part) (citations omitted).\nItem 4.\n2\nId.\n3\nId.; Item 6.\n4\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 9, 2009. He submitted\na notarized, written response to the SOR allegations on September 23, 2009, and\nrequested a decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and mailed\nApplicant a complete copy on November 11, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on\nDecember 1, 2009. He had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and\nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not submit a response.\nDOHA assigned this case to me on February 1, 2010. The government submitted 12\nexhibits, which have been marked as Item 1-12 and admitted into the record.\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR has been marked and admitted as Item 3.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the\nSOR, except the factual allegation at \u00b6 1.c, which he denied.  He did not provide any\n1\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 52 years old, works as a project manager for a Department of\nDefense contractor. He has worked for this contractor for four years. Applicant attended\ncollege, but did not complete his degree.2\nApplicant married in 1982 and divorced in 1985. He has not married a second\ntime.

He indicated that he\npaid his bills until the fall of 2003, but stopped when he could not continue his\npayments. He does not explain the reason he stopped paying his bills.4\nThe SOR alleged 16 debts, totaling $30,401. Applicant admitted owing all these\ndebts, except for one $142 medical bill. Applicant has not provided information\n\nSOR; Item 5; Item 9, Item 10.\n5\nItem 8.\n6\nId.\n7\n3\nindicating this bill is paid. The November 9, 2009 credit report reflected that the $16\nmedical bill in SOR allegation 1.a is paid.5\nIn his answers to interrogatories, Applicant indicated that he was paying several\ndebts through an agreed-upon payment plan. The payment plans have not been\nprovided. He provided copies of five checks, showing a total payment of $121 in June\n2009 on his debts. He has not provided any additional information regarding his debt\npayment, his compliance with the established payment plans, or debt counseling. 6\nApplicant also indicated in his answers to interrogatories that he was\ninvestigating several debt consolidation services, with the intent to hire one service to\nhelp with payment of his old debts. Applicant has not provided any information showing\nthat he hired a debt consolidation firm or that he has developed a payment plan for his\ndebts.   \n7\nApplicant has not provided documentation showing his income and expenses\neach month. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised AG. In addition to brief introductory\nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\n\n4\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt, which he has\nbeen unable or unwilling to pay for a long time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions.\n\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) are not applicable in this case.\n8\n5\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), mitigation may occur when\nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant did not provide any\nevidence which indicated that his debts arose under unusual circumstances or that his\ndebt problems are so old that it is unlikely that he will incur unpaid debts in the future.\nThis potentially mitigating condition is not applicable. \nUnder AG & 20(b), mitigation may occur when Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant was\nunemployed for a period of time in 2001. His e-QIP reflects that he has worked regularly\nsince July 2001. Applicant has not provided any other information which shows that\nconditions beyond his control created his financial problems This mitigating condition is\nnot applicable. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant has not attended financial\ncounseling nor has he provided information which indicates that his past debts and\ncurrent finances are under control. \nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant\ncontacted several creditors and established a payment plan. He made one payment. He\ndid not provide any information to show that he continued with his payment plans. His\nincome and expenses are unknown. Thus, I cannot determine if his current monthly\nexpenses are being paid. He provided no information to show that he retained a debt\nconsolidation company to help resolve his past debts. I conclude this potentially\nmitigating condition does not apply.8\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\n\n6\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems are more than six years old. He and his wife divorced nearly 25 years\nago. His current debts are unrelated to his divorce. His daughter is an adult and not\ndependent on him for financial support. While Applicant was laid off in 2001, his e-QIP\nreflects that he has worked steadily since July 2001. Applicant has not paid his debts for\na long period of time and has not provided any reason for his failure to pay his debts.\nHe has not provided any relevant and probative evidence which shows that he is paying\nhis old debts, either through a payment plan or a debt consolidation company. The\nrecord contains little evidence which will support the grant of a security clearance.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his finances under\nGuideline F.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b-1:p:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The Applicant is 37 years old and has a high school diploma. He is employed by a defense contractor as an ALSE Technician and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant admits twelve of the sixteen past due debts set forth in the SOR under this subparagraph; which include allegations 1(a) through 1(q); except allegation 1(b), that he contends is the same debt as 1(k); 1(c), that he discharged in his 2001 bankruptcy; 1(l), that he claims he paid; and 1(p).

Blank, Jr., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nMarch 31, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on October 21, 2008.  (Government Exhibit 4).  On August 10, 2009, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as\namended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on September 8, 2009, and he\nelected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) to\nthe Applicant on October 9, 2009.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information in\nrebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the\nFORM on October 20, 2009, but he submitted no reply.  The case was assigned to the\nundersigned for resolution on January 11, 2010.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n\n2\n FINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 37 years old and has a high school diploma.  He is employed by\na defense contractor as an ALSE Technician and is seeking to obtain a security\nclearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.      \nThe Applicant admits twelve of the sixteen past due debts set forth in the SOR\nunder this subparagraph; which include allegations 1(a) through 1(q); except allegation\n1(b), that he contends is the same debt as 1(k); 1(c), that he discharged in his 2001\nbankruptcy; 1(l), that he claims he paid; and 1(p).  Credit reports of the Applicant dated\nJuly 9, 2009; April 28, 2009; January 21, 2009; and October 29, 2008; indicate that he\nremains indebted in the amount of approximately $35,642.00.  (Government Exhibits 9,\n10. 11 and 12).  Applicant admits owing $23,135.00.  \nThe Applicant has a long history of financial problems.  From April 1999, to\nMarch 2009, he was active duty in the United States Army, and received financial\ncounseling offered by the military.  In 2001, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief and\nreceived a discharge of all of his known debts at that time.  He attributes his earlier debt\nto a divorce and debt accumulated during the marriage.   \nPresently, the Applicant indicates that most of his delinquent debts set forth in\nthe SOR, were incurred due to periods of unemployment and/or relocation, and have\nagain been included in a recently filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, and will be\ndischarged.  Several of the debts he claims have been paid.  He submits no\ndocumentary evidence to support any of his assertions.  The Applicant\u2019s e-QIP\n(Government Exhibit 4) and his personal statement (Government Exhibit 7) indicate that\nwith the exception of two brief periods in 2006, his employment has been stable since\nAugust 2004.  There is also evidence in the record that among other things, the\nApplicant purchased a truck and a boat that were repossessed in 2005, for failing to\nmake payments, and were resold.  \nApplicant received the FORM on October 20, 2009, and was given the\nopportunity to respond to the FORM concerning the present status of his bankruptcy\ncase, which is critical in this case.  (See file).  His response was due by November 19,\n2009, and he failed to respond.  There is insufficient evidence in the record to\ndemonstrate that he has resolved his current indebtedness.  There is no documentary\nevidence that supports the fact that he has recently filed bankruptcy or that the court\nhas discharge any of his delinquent debts.  There is no track record of systematic\n\n3\npayments on any of his accounts, thus, his delinquent debts remain outstanding.\nFurthermore, there is no evidence in the record as to whether he has sufficient income\nat this time, even if the debts are considered discharged, to pay his current monthly\nexpenses in a timely manner.      \n \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\n     b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\n c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\n\n4\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSION\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility, which demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation,\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant his a security clearance.\n\n5\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has failed to introduce persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.  Under the circumstances, he has failed to make a good faith effort\nto resolve his indebtedness.  He has failed to submit any evidence to support the fact\nthat he has paid even one of the debts.  Applicant contends that the most of the debts in\nthe SOR are listed in his bankruptcy petition and that they will be discharged some\nfuture date.  He did not submit a copy of the actual bankruptcy petition, nor did he\nrespond to the FORM to provide the court with additional documentary information\nconcerning the status of his delinquent debts.  He failed to provided any supporting\ndocumentary evidence.  Without more, it is impossible to determine that the Applicant\nhas resolved his indebtedness or that he is sufficiently financially responsible for access\nto classified information.  He has failed to demonstrate that he can properly handle his\nfinancial affairs.\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and, 19.(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligations apply.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  Based upon the\nlarge amount of debt owed by the Applicant and his failure to provide sufficient\ndocumentary evidence as to why he became indebted in the first place, what he has\ndone to resolve it, and how he has changed or reformed his past spending habits, the\nApplicant has failed to provide sufficient evidence of financial rehabilitation.\nAccordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).    \nThe evidence in the record is void concerning the status of the delinquent debts\nset forth in the SOR.  Furthermore, the Applicant has no favorable recommendations or\nsufficient documentation to support his allegations.  Accordingly, I have no choice than\nto find that he is not sufficiently trustworthy to have access to classified information. \n \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of poor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, a lack a\ncandor, and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.\n  \nI have considered all of the evidence presented and it does not sufficiently\nmitigate the adverse information brought against him.  On balance, it is concluded that\nthe Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a\n\n6\nsecurity clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant\nas to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.    \n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n       \n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n       \n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n       \n    Subpara.  1.n.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.o.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n       \n    Subpara.  1.p.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.q.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed an electronic Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (e-QIP) \non about October 15, 2008. On July 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct; Guideline H, Drug Involvement; and \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n  \nJanuary 26, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n In his Answer to the SOR, dated August 10, 2009, Applicant requested a \ndecision on the record in lieu of a hearing. The Government did not request a hearing \nwithin 20 days of receipt of Applicant\u2019s Answer. (See Directive, Enclosure 3, Additional \nProcedural Guidance (E3.1.7)). The Government then compiled its File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) on October 1, 2009. The FORM contained documents identified as \nItems 1 through 6. By letter dated October 7, 2009, DOHA forwarded a copy of the \nFORM to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or \nobjections within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the file on October 14, 2009. His \nresponse was due on November 13, 2009. Applicant did not file additional information \nwithin the required time period. On January 8, 2010, the case was assigned to me for a \ndecision.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains five allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline J, \nCriminal Conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e.); two allegations of disqualifying conduct \nunder Guideline H, Drug Involvement (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.); and three allegations of \ndisqualifying conduct under Guideline E, Personal Conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a through 3.c.). \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the five Guideline J allegations and the \ntwo Guideline H allegations. He admitted one Guideline E allegation (SOR \u00b6 3.c.) and \ndenied two allegations under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a. and 3.b.). Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are entered herein as findings of fact. (Item 1; Item 4.)  \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the documentary record before me, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 24 years old, never married, and employed as a mail processor by a \ngovernment contractor. He has worked for his present employer since October 2008. In \n2006, he left a job under unfavorable circumstances when he was unable to work with a \nsupervisor.  (Item 5.) \n \n \nOn November 14, 2008 and December 5, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by an \nauthorized investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). On April \n6, 2009, in response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant provided a signed notarized \nstatement which acknowledged and adopted the authorized investigator\u2019s summary of \nhis interviews as accurate. He also affirmed his understanding that his responses to the \ninterrogatories and the content of the investigator\u2019s report might be used as evidence to \ndetermine his suitability for a security clearance. (Item 6 at 7-8.) \n \n \nApplicant has purchased marijuana, and he has used marijuana, with varying \nfrequency, for approximately five years, from 2002 to at least October 2007. (Item 1: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.; Item 4 at 1; Item 6 at 3-5.) \n \n \nApplicant began smoking marijuana when he was 17 years old. Each day, he \nshared about $20 worth of marijuana with his friends. He and his friends contributed \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmoney towards the daily purchase of marijuana, or they took turns purchasing  \nmarijuana individually for the group\u2019s use. (Item 6 at 4.) \n \n \nIn 2003, Applicant was arrested, detained in jail for two days, and charged with \nPossession of Marijuana and Possession with Intent to Distribute Cocaine (Felony). The \ngovernment did not prosecute the charges, and they were dropped. (Item 1: SOR \u00b6 1.d.; \nItem 4 at 1, 2-3; Item 6 at 3.) \n  \n \nIn 2006, while Applicant was employed in a federal job program, he stopped \nusing marijuana for about two and a half months. When the program ended, Applicant \nresumed his marijuana use. (Item 6 at 4.) \n \n \nIn September 2007, and again in October 2007, Applicant was arrested and \ncharged with possession of marijuana. On both occasions, the government did not \nprosecute the charges, and they were dropped. (Item 1: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.c.; Item 4 at \n1, 2-3; Item 6 at 3-4.) \n \n \nApplicant told an authorized investigator that he last smoked marijuana on \nOctober 23, 2007. Applicant has not grown, sold, or manufactured marijuana. He has \nnot been diagnosed as drug dependent, and he has not sought treatment for drug \nabuse or drug dependency. He has not tested positive for illegal drug use. (Item 6 at 4.) \n \n \nApplicant began drinking alcohol when he was about 21 years old. In June 2008, \nApplicant was arrested and cited for Possession of Open Container/Alcohol. He was \ntaken into custody by police. He paid a $25 fine and was released. (Item 1: SOR \u00b6 1.a.; \nItem 4; Item 6 at 6.) \n \n \nWhen he was interviewed by an authorized investigator, Applicant stated that he \nonly drank alcohol on special occasions, which he estimated to be about three or four \ntimes a year. On those occasions, he consumed two to three mixed drinks in a social \nsetting with friends. Applicant denied drinking to intoxication, and he denied ever being \nintoxicated. Applicant does not own an automobile, and he does not drive a vehicle after \nconsuming alcohol. He has never been diagnosed or treated for alcohol abuse or \nalcohol dependence.  (Item 6 at 6.) \n \n \nOn October 15, 2008, Applicant executed an e-QIP. Section 23a of the e-QIP \nasks: \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense? (Include \nthose under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.)\u201d Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to Section \n23a. The SOR alleged at SOR \u00b6 3.a. that when Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section \n23a, he deliberately falsified his e-QIP by failing to list the felony charge alleged at SOR \n\u00b6 1.d. (Item 1; Item 5 at 5.) \n \n \nSection 23d of the e-QIP asks: \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of \nany offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to Section 23d. \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 3.b. that when Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section 23d, he \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndeliberately falsified his e-QIP by failing to list the drug and alcohol arrests and charges \nalleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d. (Item 1; Item 5 at 5.) \n \n \nSection 24a of the e-QIP asks: \u201cSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, \nwhichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, \nmarijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, \nheroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, \netc.), hallucinogenics (LSD,PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d \nto Section 24a. The SOR alleged at \u00b6 3.c.that when Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section \n24a, he deliberately falsified his e-QIP by failing to list his illegal use of marijuana as \nalleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b. (Item 1; Item 5 at 5.)   \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied deliberately falsifying his answers to \nSection 23d and 23a of the e-QIP he executed in October 2008. In response to the SOR \nallegation at \u00b6 3.a., Applicant stated: \u201cI put no because I [had] never been charge[d] or \nconvicted of anything[.] I was arrested and released within 24 hours and the arrest was \nno papered.\u201d In response to the SOR allegation at \u00b6 3.b., Applicant stated: \u201cI put no \nbecause I [have] never been charged or convicted or anything[.] I was arrested and \nreleased and all arrested [were] no papered and I had to just [pay] a fine for the open \ncontainer/alcohol.\u201d In his November 14, 2008 interview with an authorized investigator, \nApplicant again stated that he did not list his 2003 and 2007 drug arrests on his e-QIP \nbecause he had been released without charge and did not know the arrests needed to \nbe included. (Item 4 at 1; Ex. 6 at 3.) \n \n \nTo support his statements, Applicant provided a computer-generated list of his \narrests and the dispositions made following the arrests. He also provided a letter, dated \nNovember 4, 2008, from an attorney in the Public Defender Service in the jurisdiction \nwhere he was arrested. The attorney stated, in pertinent part: \u201cI have reviewed \n[Applicant\u2019s] records in the [court\u2019s] computer system, and the records show that \n[Applicant] has no convictions in [this jurisdiction.]\u201d The attorney also identified the \narrests alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.c., and 1.d. as \u201cno-papered\u201d arrests and reported that \nthe prosecutors \u201cdeclined to bring any charges. That is [Applicant] was never charged in \ncourt, he never had any charges pending against him in court, and the government \ndeclined to prosecute him shortly after his arrest.\u201d It is not clear from the record whether \nthe Public Defender Service attorney represented Applicant or advised him specifically \nconcerning the security clearance process and his responses to Section 23d and 23a \non the e-QIP. (Item 4 at 2-3.) \n \n \nIn his answer to SOR \u00b6 3.c., Applicant admitted that he deliberately falsified his \nanswer to Section 24a on the e-QIP by failing to admit his illegal drug use. SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nalleges that deliberate falsification of answers to questions on a security clearance \napplication constitutes a felony violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Applicant admitted the \nfelonious conduct alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e. In his interview with the authorized investigator, \nhe stated that he did not admit his illegal drug use on his e-QIP because he was afraid \nthat listing it \u201cwould look bad.\u201d (Item 1; Item 4; Item 6 at 4.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These \nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human \nbehavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n6 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \n \nUnder the Criminal Conduct guideline \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a \nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 30. \n \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in 2003 for possession of marijuana and possession with \nintent to distribute cocaine, a felony. He was arrested twice in 2007 for marijuana \npossession. In 2008, he was arrested and paid a fine for possession of an open \ncontainer of alcohol. Applicant deliberately failed to list his illegal drug use on his e-QIP \nbecause he was afraid it would \u201clook bad.\u201d This willful omission was a violation of 18 \nU.S.C. Section 1001. \n  \n           Applicant\u2019s history of three drug arrests, one alcohol-related arrest, and his \ndeliberate falsification of his drug use on his security clearance application raise \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 31(a) and AG \u00b6 31(c). AG \u00b6 31(a) reads: \u201ca single serious crime or \nmultiple lesser offenses.\u201d AG \u00b6 31(c) reads: \u201callegation or admission or criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted.\u201d \n \n \n \nTwo Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions might apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  If \n\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a) might apply.  If \n\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of \ntime without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive involvement,\u201d then AG \u00b6 32(d) \nmight apply. \n \n \n \nThe record establishes that Applicant was arrested for criminal behavior in 2003, \n2007, and 2008. Additionally, he admitted criminal conduct in October 2008 when he \ndeliberately falsified his e-QIP. Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior is recent; his most recent \ncriminal conduct occurred approximately fifteen months ago. Nothing in the record \nbefore me suggests successful rehabilitation or provides assurances that Applicant\u2019s \ncriminal behavior is unlikely to recur. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \nIn 2008, Applicant deliberately falsified his e-QIP by concealing and failing to \nreport his use of illegal drugs. His unwillingness to inform the government about this \npast criminal behavior raises concerns about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Additionally, his deliberate falsifications suggest a failure in rehabilitation. I \nconclude that AG \u00b6 32(a) and AG \u00b6 32(d) do not apply to Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct \nand his deliberate falsification of his e-QIP in 2008. \n \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness because it may impair judgment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. AG \u00b6 24(a) defines drugs as \u201cmood and behavior altering \nsubstances.\u201d The definition of drugs includes \u201c(1) drugs, materials, and other chemical \ncompounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended \n(e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), \nand (2) inhalants and other similar substances.\u201d AG \u00b6 24(b) defines drug abuse as \u201cthe \nillegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction.\u201d \n \nThe record shows that Applicant admitted the illegal use and possession of \nmarijuana, with varying frequency, for approximately five years, from 2002 until at least \n2007. In 2006, he attempted to stop using marijuana when he participated in a federal \njob program. When his participation in the program ended, he returned to marijuana \nuse. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was habitual and a lifestyle choice. \n \nApplicant\u2019s involvement with an illegal drug, marijuana, casts doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  It also raises security concerns about his \nability or willingness to protect classified information and to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. I conclude that Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use raises security concerns under \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c). AG \u00b6 25(a) reads: \u201cany drug abuse [as defined at AG \u00b6 24(b)].\u201d \nAG \u00b6 25(c) reads: \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d  \n  \nTwo Guideline H mitigating conditions might apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  If Applicant\u2019s drug use happened \u201cso long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\u201d on his \n\u201ccurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 26(a) might be \napplicable in mitigation. If Applicant \u201cdemonstrated [an] intent not to abuse any drugs in \nthe future\u201d by \u201c(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing \nor avoiding the environment where drugs were used;\u201d (3) abstaining from drug use for \nan appropriate period; and (4) signing a \u201cstatement of intent with the automatic \nrevocation\u201d of his security clearance \u201cfor any violation,\u201d then AG \u00b6 26(b) might be \napplicable.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                           \nThe documentary record shows that Applicant\u2019s first arrest for marijuana \npossession occurred in 2003. His most recent arrests for marijuana possession \noccurred in September and October 2007. His use at that time was on-going and \nfrequent. While he told an authorized investigator that he ceased using illegal drugs in \nOctober 2007, he provided no documentation to corroborate his assertion. Nothing in \nthe record supports a conclusion that he no longer associates with individuals who use \ndrugs habitually. Nothing in the record establishes that he has abstained from drugs for \nan appropriate period in order to demonstrate an intent not to abuse drugs in the future. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana occurred under circumstances that are likely to recur. I \nconclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) do not apply in mitigation to the security concerns \nraised by the facts in Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed and certified his e-QIP in 2008, he failed to report his  \ncriminal behavior, including a felony arrest, and his use of illegal drugs.1 In his answer \nto the SOR, he denied that his failure to disclose his criminal conduct was deliberate \nfalsification of material facts and stated that he did not consider the conduct to be \ncriminal since he was neither charged nor prosecuted. He was assessed a $25 fine as \nthe result of his one alcohol-related arrest for Open Container/Alcohol. He provided a \nletter from a public defender attorney to corroborate his belief that his three drug arrests \ndid not result in charges or prosecution and therefore he did not believe they were \n \n1 The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)).  \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nreportable as criminal behavior on his e-QIP. Applicant\u2019s rationale for failing to list his \nthree drug arrests and one alcohol arrest on his e-QIP was corroborated by a letter \nsupplied for the record by a Public Defender attorney who reviewed his record.  \n \nThe allegations in the SOR raise a security concern under AG \u00b6 16(a), which \nreads: \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities.\u201d \n \n \n \nSeveral Guideline mitigating conditions might apply to the facts of this case. \nApplicant\u2019s disqualifying personal conduct might be mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(a) if \u201cthe \nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or \nfalsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d If \u201cthe refusal or failure to cooperate, \nomission, or concealment was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or \ninadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning the security process\u201d and \u201c[u]pon being made aware of \nthe requirement to cooperate or provide information, the individual cooperated fully and \ncompletely,\u201d then AG \u00b6 17(b) might apply.  If \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time \nhas passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 17(c) might apply. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) might apply if \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and \nobtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e) might apply if \n\u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d   \n \nI have reviewed the documentary evidence in this case carefully. While I was \nunable to question Applicant about his state of mind when he completed his e-QIP, the \nrecord reflects that he consistently believed he should not list his arrests and detentions \non his e-QIP because he was not prosecuted and charges against him were dismissed. \nHis belief was reinforced by the statements of the Public Defender attorney in her letter \nof November 4, 2008. I conclude that there is insufficient record evidence to conclude \nthat Applicant\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d answers to Sections 23d and 23a on the e-QIP he executed on \nOctober 15, 2008 were willful and deliberate falsifications. \n \nHowever, I conclude that Applicant deliberately falsified material facts in his \nresponse to Section 24a on the e-QIP when he denied any illegal drug use since the \nage of 16 or in the last seven years.  Nothing in the record suggests that he took prompt \ngood-faith action to correct the omissions, concealments, or falsifications before he was \nconfronted with the facts. (AG \u00b6 17(a).)  Nothing in the record suggests that his failure to \nreport his illegal drug use was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or \n\n \n10 \n \n \ninadequate advice specifically about the security clearance process from authorized \nindividuals or legal counsel. (AG \u00b6 17(b).) When he executed his e-QIP, Applicant knew \nhe had used drugs illegally, and he acknowledged that he had falsified his e-QIP by \nomitting information about his illegal drug use because he believed \u201cit looked bad.\u201d As a \nmature adult, he knew that his criminal behavior was not minor, so remote in time, so \ninfrequent, or had occurred under such unique circumstances that it would not seriously \nimpact his eligibility for a security clearance. (AG 17(c).) Applicant failed to provide \ndocumentation that he obtained counseling or had taken other positive steps that might \nalleviate the circumstances that caused his unreliable conduct and, as a result, such \nbehavior was unlikely to recur. (AG \u00b6 17(d).) Nothing in the record suggests that \nApplicant took positive steps to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress that his behavior caused. (AG \u00b6 17(e).) I conclude, therefore, \nthat Applicant\u2019s failure to report his illegal drug use on his e-QIP was deliberate and that \nnone of the personal conduct mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \nApplicant habitually used the illegal drug marijuana from 2003 until at least 2007. \nHe stopped using drugs when he attended a federal jobs program, but he resumed his \nuse of illegal drugs after the program ended. He was arrested in 2003 for marijuana \npossession and possession with intent to distribute cocaine. He was arrested twice in \n2007 for marijuana possession. He was cited for an alcohol violation in 2008. In 2008, \nhe completed an e-QIP and deliberately failed to report his illegal drug use, thereby \ncreating a situation that could seriously mislead the government about his honesty, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. His falsification was not minor: it went to the heart of his \n\n \n11 \n \n \ncapacity for truthfulness, a critical qualification for one who would hold a security \nclearance. Applicant\u2019s failure to be truthful was deliberate. He made no effort to correct \nhis falsification before the government confronted him with his lack of candor. His \ndeliberate falsification is recent. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Consistent with the\nfollowing discussion, we affirm the decision of the Judge.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant served in the U.S. Air\nForce, retiring in 2005.  Earlier, in 2000, he had received non-judicial punishment under Article 15,\nUniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), for knowing possession of child pornography.  This\ndisciplinary action was the result of evidence found during a search by criminal investigators of\nApplicant\u2019s personal computer.  \nAfter the search, Applicant consulted with a psychologist regarding his concerns about his\ninternet viewing habits.  Soon after this, Applicant visited a psychiatrist, due to stress and depression\nregarding the criminal investigation, his father\u2019s death, and the breakup of his marriage.  \nIn 2003, Applicant completed a SCA.  He answered \u201cno\u201d to a question inquiring if he had\nconsulted a mental health professional within the previous seven years.  He also answered \u201cno\u201d to\na question inquiring if, within the previous seven years, he had been punished under the UCMJ, to\ninclude non-judicial punishment.  Both of these answers were false.\nIn 2004, after his security manager pointed out these omissions, Applicant submitted a\ndocument correcting the errors in his SCA.  In 2005, anticipating retirement, Applicant applied for\njobs as a policeman and as a correctional officer.  He was rejected, because he did not disclose his\nnon-judicial punishment to his prospective employers.  \nLater in 2005, before his retirement, Applicant underwent a psychiatric evaluation.  The\npsychiatrist concluded that (1) Applicant did not have a mental disorder and (2) his records were not\nsufficient to clearly substantiate knowing possession of child pornography.  In September 2008,\nApplicant submitted another SCA.  He answered \u201cno\u201d to a question inquiring if he had consulted\na mental health professional during the previous seven years.  This answer was false.  Applicant\u2019s\nomissions on his 2003 and 2008 SCAs were alleged in the SOR as Guideline E security concerns.1\nIn the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge found that the \u201cno\u201d answers described\nabove were deliberate.  The Judge stated that, when he completed the SCAs in question, Applicant\nwas an experienced NCO, had worked through the security clearance process before, and had\npreviously held a clearance.  The Judge also considered Applicant\u2019s failure to advise his prospective\n\n3\ncivilian employers in 2005 about his non-judicial punishment.  Although this conduct was not\nalleged, the Judge stated that he considered it on the issue of Applicant\u2019s credibility, among other\nthings.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03250 at n. 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007).  Viewed in light of the\nrecord as a whole, the Judge\u2019s findings of deliberate falsification are sustainable.\n   The record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 10, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision \nto revoke his security clearance, citing concerns under Guideline E. DOHA acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by  the Department of \nDefense on September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 26, 2010, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. DOHA received the request on April 1, 2010. Department \nAugust 17, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nCounsel amended the SOR on April 8, 2010, by adding two additional allegations. \nDepartment Counsel was ready to proceed on April 8, 2010, and the case was assigned \nto me on April 14, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 20, 2010, scheduling \nthe hearing for May 11, 2010. Applicant responded to the amended SOR on April 21, \n2010. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 16 \nwere admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through W, which were admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on May 21, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a, alleging that he \nreceived non-judicial punishment while on active duty in the U.S. Air Force for knowingly \npossessing child pornography on his computer. He denied intentionally falsifying his \nsecurity clearance application, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d, and making false \nstatements to a security investigator, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. His admissions in his \nanswer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant served in the U.S. Air Force from July 1985 to October 2005, retiring as \na master sergeant (pay grade E-7). (AX W.) He held a security clearance throughout his \nAir Force service. During his military service, he received numerous certificates of \nappreciation and certificates of recognition. (AX J through R.) He was awarded the Air \nForce Achievement Medal three times and the Air Force Commendation Medal once. \n(AX S through V.) A chief master sergeant (pay grade E-9), who has known Applicant \nsince 1998 and was his military supervisor, described him as hard working, dependable, \ntrustworthy, and a strong and caring leader. (AX I.) \n \n \nApplicant married in March 1988. He and his wife became estranged in 2000, \nwhen he discovered that she was having an affair. They separated in February 2001, \nand divorced in May 2002. Three children were born during the marriage.  \n \n \nOn July 21, 2000, local civilian police went to Applicant\u2019s home in response to a \ncomplaint from his estranged wife that he had left their children unattended for an \nextended time. He had been involved in a car accident and was unable to get home \nbefore the babysitter departed. (Tr. 44-46.) The police found pornographic materials in \nthe house. His wife told police she had observed him viewing child pornography \u201ctoo \nmany times to count.\u201d The police seized his computer and numerous videocassettes, \nand they found 17 suspected images of child pornography and two text files about \nsexual acts with children. (GX 6; GX 8 at 5.) \n \n \nIn July 2000, Applicant consulted with a clinical psychologist at the base mental \nhealth clinic. Applicant\u2019s medical records reflect that he consulted with the psychologist \non July 10, but he testified he consulted with the psychologist after his computer was \nseized on July 21. (GX 16 at 3; Tr. 86.) He testified that he went to the mental health \nclinic to find out if he had an addiction to pornography and needed treatment. He \ntestified that the psychologist told him that viewing pornography was not an addiction, \n\n \n3 \n \n \nbut a conscious choice. (Tr. 52-53.) The psychologist\u2019s notes indicate that three \nadditional sessions of supportive treatment were planned, but Applicant testified he \nconsulted with this psychologist only one time. (GX 16 at 3; Tr. 56.)  \n \nApplicant visited a psychiatrist at the mental health clinic on October 10, 2000. \nThe psychiatrist\u2019s notes indicate that he was interested in obtaining an anti-depressant. \nThey also indicate that he described a \u201chorrible year,\u201d in which he was going through a \ndivorce from his wife, his father had committed suicide, and he was being investigated \nfor suspected child abuse. (GX 16 at 1.)  \n \n \nApplicant testified he went to the mental health clinic in October 2000 because \nhe was concerned about his weight and had been told that an anti-depressant could \nhelp him lose weight. He testified he was also concerned about everything that had \ngone wrong with his life. He received a prescription for an anti-depressant and tried \nusing it for about three days, but his friends convinced him that he should stop using it \nbecause he could not safely consume alcohol while using it. (Tr. 54-55.)  \n \n \nIn December 7, 2000, Applicant received non-judicial punishment under Article \n15, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C \u00a7 815, for knowingly possessing child \npornography on his computer on divers occasions between February 1, 2000, and July \n21, 2000. He was a technical sergeant (pay grade E-6) at the time. He denied \nintentionally downloading or possessing child pornography on his computer, but his \ncommander found that he was guilty of the offense alleged. (GX 9.) His punishment was \na reduction to staff sergeant (pay grade E-5), forfeiture of $500 pay per month for two \nmonths, 45 days of extra duty, and a reprimand. The reduction to staff sergeant was \nsuspended for six months. (GX 15.) Notwithstanding his non-judicial punishment, \nApplicant was allowed to reenlist in November 2001, and he was promoted to master \nsergeant in September 2003. (Attachment to Answer to SOR; AX W.)  \n \nApplicant married his current spouse in July 2002. She has two children, ages 14 \nand 12, who live with them. The older child suffers from attention deficit hyperactive \ndisorder and the younger child is autistic. (GX 1 at 5-6; GX 8 at 4; Tr. 67.) \n \n \nIn June 2003, Applicant submitted an application to continue his security \nclearance (SF 86). He answered \u201cno\u201d to question 19, which asks, \u201cIn the last 7 years, \nhave you consulted a mental health professional (psychiatrist, psychologist, counselor, \netc.) or have you consulted with another health care provider about a mental health \ncondition?\u201d (GX 1 at 9.) He did not disclose his consultation with a clinical psychologist \nin July 2000 or his consultation with a psychiatrist in October 2003. He testified that he \nstopped reading the question at the word \u201cpsychiatrist\u201d and skipped to words \u201cmental \nhealth condition\u201d at the end of the sentence. He answered \u201cno\u201d because he did not \nbelieve he had a \u201cmental health condition\u201d such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, \nalcoholism, or drug addiction. (Tr. 57-58.) \n \nOn the same SF 86, Applicant also answered \u201cno\u201d to question 25, which asks, \u201cIn \nthe last 7 years, have you been subject to court-martial or other disciplinary proceedings \n\n \n4 \n \n \nunder the Uniform Code of Military Justice?\u201d The parenthetical explanation following the \nquestion specifically tells applicants to \u201cinclude non-judicial, Captain\u2019s mast, etc.\u201d \nNevertheless, he did not disclose his non-judicial punishment in December 2000. He \ntestified he saw the reference to a court-martial but overlooked the reference to non-\njudicial punishment. (Tr. 59-60.) \n \n \nOn December 23, 2003, Applicant scheduled an appointment for January 7, \n2004, at the base mental health center. (GX 10.) He was evaluated by a staff \npsychologist, whose notes indicate that he denied having any mental disorders, but that \nhe believed he had betrayed his wife by viewing on-line pornography, and his wife \nwanted him to be evaluated. The psychologist\u2019s notes also indicate that Applicant \nreported an 11-year period of addiction to pornography that resulted in the breakup of \nhis first marriage, that he had been seen by a psychiatrist at an overseas base, and that \nhe was given medication to control his compulsions. (GX 11.) In May 2004, Applicant \ninformed the psychologist that he did not wish to receive any further services. The \npsychologist deferred making a diagnosis because she had insufficient information on \nwhich to make a diagnostic judgment. (GX 12; GX 14.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that his second wife was very angry when she discovered that \nhe had viewed pornography. His wife insisted that he seek counseling because he had \nreverted to his earlier involvement with pornography, which she considered \nunacceptable. Applicant admitted telling the psychologist that he had an 11-year history \nof viewing pornography on his computer and that he had received medication to deal \nwith grief after the death of his father. (Answer to amended SOR; Tr. 63-64.) He denied \ntelling the psychologist that he was addicted to pornography and had received \nmedication to control his compulsions. He testified that he does not believe he is \naddicted to pornography. (Tr. 61-65.)   \n \n \nIn April 2004, Applicant resubmitted his SF 86 from June 2003 to his local \nsecurity manager, seeking a clearance to work on a new program. After his security \nmanager pointed out his omissions of his non-judicial punishment and his consultations \nwith mental health professionals, Applicant submitted a Standard Form 86 Certification \n(SF 86C), correcting his answers to questions 19 and 25 of his SF 86. In the SF 86C, he \ndisclosed his non-judicial punishment and his consultations with mental health \nprofessionals on three occasions in 2000. Because of his non-judicial punishment, he \nwas not selected for the new program. (Tr. 106.). He received a letter of admonishment \nfrom his first sergeant for failing to disclose his non-judicial punishment on his SF 86. \n(Tr. 59; Attachments to Answer to SOR.) \n \n \nIn June 2004, Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator. He described \nthe circumstances surrounding his non-judicial punishment. He also told the \ninvestigator, \u201cI talked with [a] mental health professional . . . once at the hospital . . . to \nsee if I had a pornographic addiction, which I did not and they did not find that I did \neither; it all came down to being a choice on my part to access the pictures.\u201d (GX 8 at \n5.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nIn January or February 2005, in anticipation of retirement, Applicant applied for a \nposition with the local city police department and for a correctional officer position. He \npassed all the tests, but he was rejected for both positions because he did not disclose \nhis non-judicial punishment in his applications. The record of his non-judicial \npunishment was discovered in the criminal records maintained by the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation as a result of a criminal records check by his prospective employers. \nApplicant testified he did not disclose his non-judicial punishment to his prospective \nemployers because it was not a court conviction. (Tr. 99-100.) \n \n \nIn September 2005, shortly before his retirement, Applicant sought and received \na psychiatric evaluation at the base where he was stationed. The psychiatrist reviewed \nhis record, including the treatment records from January through May 2004, and found \nno psychosis or other mental disorder. The psychiatrist commented that Applicant made \nsome poor judgments in the past, but \u201cthe issues regarding child porn on his personal \ncomputer at home were never clearly substantiated by reviewing his records.\u201d (GX 13.) \n \n \nApplicant was employed by a defense contractor immediately after his retirement \nfrom the Air Force. He began working as a metal fabricator for his current employer in \nApril 2008. Seven coworkers who have known him since his retirement submitted letters \non his behalf. They uniformly describe him as truthful, trustworthy, hard working, and \ndedicated to his family. (AX B through H.)  \n \nIn September 2008, Applicant submitted another SF 86. He answered \u201cno\u201d to \nquestion 21, pertaining to consultation for mental health conditions during the last seven \nyears. He did not disclose his consultations with mental health professionals in January \n2004 and September 2005. He testified he answered this question in the negative \nbecause he did not have a mental health condition and because he visited the \npsychiatrist in connection with his security clearance application and not for treatment. \n(Tr. 70-71.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \n\n \n6 \n \n \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 \nat 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant received non-judicial punishment for knowingly \npossessing child pornography on his computer (\u00b6 1.a); and that he falsified his SF 86 in \nJune 2003 by answering \u201cno\u201d to question 19 concerning consultation with a mental \nhealth professional \u00b6 1.b(1)), and by answering \u201cno\u201d to question 25 concerning court-\nmartial or other military disciplinary proceedings such as non-judicial punishment (\u00b6 \n1.b(2). The amended SOR alleges that he falsified material facts in a sworn statement \nto a security investigator by failing to disclose his 11-year history of addiction to \npornography, his treatment by a psychiatrist for that addiction, and his receipt of \n\n \n7 \n \n \nmedications to control his compulsions (\u00b6 1.c). Finally, the amended SOR alleges that \nhe falsified his SF 86 in September 2008 by answering \u201cno\u201d to question 21 concerning \nconsultation with a mental health professional and deliberately failing to disclose his \nconsultations with mental health professionals in January 2004 and September 2005 (\u00b6 \n1.d). \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions pertaining to Applicant\u2019s alleged \nfalsifications of security clearance applications and false sworn statement provided to a \nsecurity investigator are AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of \nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire) and AG \u00b6 16(b) (deliberately \nproviding false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an investigator). \n \nThe SOR does not allege Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his non-judicial \npunishment to prospective employers in early 2005. Thus, this conduct may not be an \nindependent basis for denying him a clearance. However, conduct not alleged in the \nSOR may be considered to assess an applicant=s credibility; to decide whether a \nparticular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has \ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole person analysis. ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). I have considered \nthe conduct that was not alleged in the SOR for these limited purposes. \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his SF 86 in June 2003, he was not an inexperienced \nairman or a security neophyte. He was an experienced noncommissioned officer who \nhad worked through the security process before and had held a clearance for about \neight years. He sought mental health counseling because he was concerned that he \nmight need treatment for an addiction to pornography, he was depressed because his \nworld was falling apart, and he was concerned about being overweight. His testimony \nthat he skimmed past the middle portion of the question about mental health \nconsultation and overlooked the reference to non-judicial punishment in the question \nabout courts-martial or other disciplinary proceedings is neither plausible nor credible.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s sworn statement in June 2004 does not reflect the questions asked \nby the investigator. Nevertheless, the topic headings within the statement make it clear \nthat the discussion involved his non-judicial punishment for possessing child \npornography and his consultation with mental health professionals to determine whether \nhe was addicted to pornography. The allegation that Applicant falsified his statement by \n\n \n8 \n \n \nfailing to disclose addiction to pornography, psychiatric treatment for the addiction, and \nmedication to control \u201ccompulsions\u201d is based on the psychologist\u2019s notes. I am satisfied \nthat Applicant was never diagnosed as addicted to pornography, treated for an \naddiction, or medicated to control \u201ccompulsions.\u201d Accordingly, I am satisfied that \nApplicant\u2019s discussion of his consultation with the psychiatrist in his sworn statement \nwas not false. \n \nApplicant was informed by his unit security manager in April 2004 that he should \nhave listed his mental health consultations and non-judicial punishment when he \nsubmitted his SF 86 in June 2003. In early 2005, he was rejected for two civilian jobs \nbecause of his lack of candor on his applications. When he submitted his latest SF 86 in \nSeptember 2008, he knew he had consulted with a mental health professional at his \nwife\u2019s insistence, and he knew he had consulted with a psychiatrist about coping with \ngrief and received a prescription medication. When he saw a psychiatrist in September \n2005, he was seeking a favorable medical diagnosis to overcome concerns raised by \nhis involvement with child pornography. His explanation that he did not think these \nconsultations in 2004 and 2005 were within the scope of the question is implausible and  \nnot credible. \n \nOn consideration of all the evidence, I conclude that the disqualifying condition in \nAG \u00b6 16(a) is raised by Applicant\u2019s intentional omissions from his security clearance \napplications in June 2003 and September 2008. I also conclude that AG \u00b6 16(b) is not \nraised because Applicant did not falsify material facts in his sworn statement to a \nsecurity investigator. I conclude Applicant has rebutted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c, and \nit is resolved in his favor. \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions pertaining to Applicant\u2019s non-judicial \npunishment for knowing possession of child pornography are as follows: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe person may not properly safeguard protected information. This \nincludes but is not limited to consideration of . . . a pattern of dishonesty or \nrule violations; and  \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing.  \n \nApplicant has not denied that child pornography was found on his computer, but \nhe has consistently denied that he knowingly and intentionally downloaded and kept it. \nThe commander who imposed non-judicial punishment was not persuaded by his \ndenials. I also am not persuaded. I have considered all the evidence, including the 17 \nimages and two text files describing sexual acts with children that were found on his \ncomputer. I have also evaluated the credibility of Applicant\u2019s claim of innocence in light \nof his record of deception, discussed above. Finally, I have considered the relatively low \nevidentiary burden of proof required to raise a disqualifying condition (\u201cmore than a \nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d). I conclude that Applicant\u2019s record of non-\njudicial punishment raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), (d), and (e). \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), (c), (d), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication or during a security interview may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or \nfalsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). This mitigating \ncondition is not established because Applicant made no effort to correct his omissions \nfrom his 2003 application until he was confronted with the evidence by his security \nmanager, and he made no effort to correct his omissions from his 2008 application until \nhe received the amended SOR.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is \nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d. AG \u00b6 17(c). Applicant\u2019s \ninvolvement with child pornography and his multiple falsifications were not minor \noffenses. His last involvement with child pornography was ten years ago. Although he \nviewed pornography again in 2004, there is no evidence that it involved children. His \ncurrent spouse strongly disapproves of pornography, and Applicant appears to be \ndeeply devoted to his family. \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant\u2019s most recent falsification of his SF 86 was in \nSeptember 2008 and involved his current application for a clearance. None of his \nfalsifications occurred under unique circumstances. I conclude that Applicant\u2019s non-\njudicial punishment for involvement in child pornography in December 2000 is mitigated \n\n \n10 \n \n \nby the passage of time without recurrence, but that AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established for the \nfalsifications of his SF 86 in June 2003 and September 2008. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nhas acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or \ntaken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that \ncaused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is \nunlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). Applicant has never acknowledged that he knowingly \npossessed child pornography. He sought counseling to determine if he was addicted to \nadult pornography and apparently was assured that he was not. His wife\u2019s strong views \nabout pornography and his devotion to his family make further involvement in \npornography unlikely. On the other hand, Applicant has acknowledged that his \nresponses to the mental health and disciplinary record questions were incorrect, but he \nhas not acknowledged his repeated and intentional falsifications. I conclude that AG \u00b6 \n17(d) is established for SOR \u00b6 1.a but not for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nhas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e). Applicant has reduced his vulnerability related to \npornography, but he has continued his pattern of intentional deception. I conclude that \nAG \u00b6 17(e) is established for SOR \u00b6 1.a but not for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult who served in the U.S. Air Force for more than 20 \nyears. He appears to be highly regarded in his current employment. He is devoted to his \n\n \n11 \n \n \nfamily. On the other hand, his continuing lack of candor raises serious doubts about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns based \non personal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for access \nto classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nHistory of Case\nOn November 23, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs).\nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 7, 2009, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was scheduled for hearing on April 13, 2010. A hearing was held on the\nSeptember 30, 2010\n\n2\nscheduled date. At the hearing, the Government's case consisted of nine exhibits (GE).\nApplicant relied on one witness (himself) and no exhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on April 21, 2010. \nBesides its nine exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of five\ndocuments: Background Note: Iraq, U.S. Department of State (February  2008);  Country\nSpecific Information: Iraq, U.S. Department of State (January 25, 2010); Travel Warning:\nIraq, U.S. Department of State (November 2009) Country Reports on Terrorism 2008,\nU.S. Department of State (April 2009); 2008 Human Rights Report: Iraq, U.S.\nDepartment of State (February 2009). \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for\nadministrative proceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 12, 2007).\nAdministrative notice is appropriate for noticing facts or government reports that are well\nknown.  See Stein, Administrative Law, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006).  For good\ncause shown, administrative notice was granted with respect to the above-named\nbackground reports addressing the geopolitical situation in Iraq. \nAdministrative notice was extended to the documents themselves, consistent  with\nthe provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evid.  This notice did not foreclose Applicant from\nchallenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the reports\naddressing Iraq\u2019s  current status.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged in the SOR to: (a) have a mother, three\nbrothers, and two sisters who are citizens and residents of Iraq; (b) have a spouse who\nis a citizen of Iraq and resides in the U.S.; (c) send $600 a month to his family in Iraq;\nand (d) have traveled to Iraq in 2006, 2007, and 2009 to visit relatives. \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his Questionnaire for\nNational Security Positions (e-QIP) by omitting his driving under the influence (DUI)\narrest of July 1999 and his October 2007 criminal trespass arrest (banned from a casino\nfor two years by the court, and the charges were dismissed in January 2008). \n Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated 11 delinquent debts\nexceeding $32,000.  Allegedly, the debts have not been satisfied.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations.  He added\nno explanations. \n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 44-year old former employee  for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nadopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\n\n3\nBackground\nApplicant was born and raised in Iraq.  He served in the Iraqi military between\n1991 and 1992, and has no further obligations to fulfill his mandatory military service as\nan Iraqi citizen. (GE 4) He has expressed a willingness to renounce his Iraqi citizenship.\n(GE 4)\nApplicant immigrated to the U.S. in 1996 without any familiarity with the English\nlanguage.

(GE 1)  Applicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen of Iraq who resides in the U.S. Applicant\nmarried his spouse in 2007, and they have one child from their marriage. (GE 1; Tr. 56,\n67)  She moved to the U.S. in April 2009 and intends to apply for U.S. citizenship.  (Tr.\n75-76)  Before she can apply for U.S. citizenship, she will need to first apply for and\nobtain permanent resident status in the U.S. (GE 4)\nApplicant\u2019s mother, three brothers, and two sisters are citizens and residents of\nIraq. (see GE 1; Tr. 55, 63-65) Applicant maintains monthly telephone contact with his\nmother, and relies on her to convey messages to his other family members. (Tr. 69, 72)\nHe communicates less frequently with his brothers and sisters. (Tr. 72-73)  Applicant\nperiodically travels to Iraq to visit his family. Specifically, he traveled to Iraq in 2006,\n2007, and 2009.  (see GEs 1 and 4 through 7; Tr. 76-78)  \nUntil recently, Applicant sent about $600 a month to his family members in Iraq.\n(GEs 4 and 6) Pending his receipt of his security clearance, his employer has suspended\nhim from employment. (see GE 7; Tr. 52, 58)  Without work, he has had to suspend his\npractice of providing financial assistance to his family. (Tr. 73-74)  \nStill dual citizens of Iraq and the U.S., Applicant and his wife recently voted in Iraqi\nelections. (Tr. 78-79) Because his wife is not a U.S. citizen, she cannot vote in U.S.\nelections. (Tr. 79) Given his Shiite religious attachments and Saddam Hussein\u2019s years of\npolitical domination, Applicant  does not feel he can safely return to Iraq for any extended\nperiod without placing himself at considerable risk. (Tr. 77)  \nIraq\u2019s country status\nIraq is a country of 27 million that is broken down along ethnic and religious lines:\nShiites, Sunni, Kurds and Turkoman comprise the predominant ethnic and sectarian\ngroups.   Once known as Mesopotamia (the fertile crescent), Iraq is bordered by Kuwait,\nIran, Turkey, Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia (see Background Note, Iraq, supra, at 2-3).\nAt the end of World War I, Iraq became a British-mandated territory, and founding\nmember of the Arab League (id.).\nGeneral Abdul Karim Qasim assumed power in a July 1958 coup and held power\nfor five years before succumbing to the Ba\u2019ath Party\u2019s takeover of the Iraqi government,\n\n4\nand Hasan al-Bakr\u2019s selection as prime minister.  (see Background Note, Iraq, supra, at\n4)  When Bakr resigned in 1979, Saddam  Hussein assumed the reigns of power. Under\nSaddam Hussein\u2019s direction, Iraq launched a major invasion of its neighbor, Iran in the\n1980s (see Background Note Iraq, supra).  Iraq declared victory in 1988 and survived to\nclaim the largest military establishment in the region.  Iraq then turned its forces to\nmounted attacks against the ongoing Kurdish rebellion by Kurdish elements in the\nnorthern mountains of Iraq.    \nIraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, and was repelled by a U.S.-led coalition in\nFebruary 1991 (see Background Note, Iraq, supra).  After the war, the UN Security\nCouncil required the Hussein regime to surrender to the coalition and submit to UN\ninspections.  When the Ba\u2019ath regime refused to fully comply, the Security Council\ninvoked sanctions to prevent further weapons of mass destruction (WMD) development,\nand to enforce Iraq\u2019s surrender terms.  Coalition forces employed limited no-fly zones in\nsouthern and northern Iraq and a limited no-drive zone in southern Iraq to prevent the\nregime from invading Kuwait again. (id.)\nIn 2003, A U.S.-led coalition invaded Iraq and succeeded in removing Saddam\nHussein and his Ba\u2019athist regime from military and political power (see Background Note,\nIraq, supra, at 3).  After two years of operations under a provisional authority, Iraq\u2019s new\ngovernment assumed office in March 2006 (with the approval of the U.S. Government),\nfollowing free elections. (see id.)\nNotwithstanding the election of a new national government with U.S. backing,\nviolence continued to envelop the country.  This violence was fueled and perpetrated by\nAl Qieda terrorists, Sunni insurgents, and, Shiite militias and death squads. (see\nBackground Note, Iraq, supra, and Country Reports on Terrorism 2008, supra) State\nDepartment reports document human rights abuses that include a \u201cpervasive climate of\nviolence, misappropriation of official authority by sectarian, criminal and insurgent\ngroups; arbitrary deprivation of life, disappearances, torture and other cruel, inhumane or\ndegrading treatment or punishment.\u201d (see id.)\nSince March 2006, the Government of Iraq has been comprised of a broad\ncoalition of political alliances representing the Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish blocs. (see\nBackground Note, Iraq, supra, at 8)  While elections have been held, none of the key\nconstituent groups have been able to form a government, adopt an oil law, establish and\nmaintain effective security throughout the provinces, or neutralize sectarian divisions. In\nthis still very fragile political environment in Iraq, there are substantiated reports of\nhuman rights abuses that continue to underscore a still pervasive climate of tension and\nviolence.\nEconomically, Iraq\u2019s economy continues to be dominated by the oil sector, as it\nhas for the past half century since the completion of new pipelines to Lebanon in 1949,\nand to Syria in 1952. (see Background Note, Iraq, supra)  As a result of the  U.S.-led\ninvasion in 2003, much of Iraq\u2019s oil refining capabilities were shuttered.  The rebuilding of\noil infrastructure and utilities infrastructure has continued to expand since 2004 with U.S.\n\n5\naid and support, despite setbacks from insurgent activity.  Proposed oil revenue sharing\nlegislation still awaits passage, however, and at the moment, there are no good\nestimates of when such legislation will be approved and implemented. For the\nforeseeable future, the national government can be expected to continue to seek the\npassage and implementation of a revenue sharing law to strengthen and encourage the\ndevelopment of this important sector (see id.)\nDespite recent improvements in its security enforcement efforts, Iraq remains a\nvery dangerous, volatile and unpredictable country. The U.S. State Department\ncontinues to strongly warn U.S. citizens against traveling to Iraq. (see Travel Warning,\nIraq, supra, at 1) Attacks against military and civilian targets throughout Iraq continue\nand include sites and facilities where foreign tourists frequently visit: hotels, restaurants,\npolice stations, check points, foreign diplomatic missions, international organizations,\nand other locations with expatriate personnel. (id.)\nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions \nAsked to complete a security clearance application in July 2008, Applicant omitted\nhis 1999 DUI arrest and his 2007 criminal trespass arrest. Applicant attributes his\nomissions to haste, language difficulties, and confusion over the meaning of arrest. (Tr.\n89-91) The questions were straight-forward, though, and not susceptible to mistaken\nreading.  Considering Applicant\u2019s arrest history, education, and experience at the time,\nAppellant cannot avert inferences that he knowingly and wilfully omitted his 2007 and\n2008 arrests from his e-QIP. \nWhen questioned by an agent from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\nin September 2008, Applicant was confronted with his two omitted arrests and disclosed\nthem fully when pressed by the agent. (Tr. 89-90, 96, 112)  Applicant\u2019s explanations are\ninsufficient to avert inferences he acknowledged his arrests voluntarily without\nprompting.    \nApplicant\u2019s finances\nSince his lay-off in 2002, Applicant accumulated considerable delinquent debts.\n(see GE 4)  His credit reports reflect 11 delinquent debts (mostly credit cards) exceeding\n$32,000. (see GEs 2, 8, and 9)  Many of these delinquent accounts reflect debts related\nto his periods of unemployment and  gambling losses. (Tr. 99-101)  \nSince he moved to his current state of residence in October 2009, he has ceased\ngambling. (Tr. 100-05)  However, he can document little progress in addressing his\ndebts. His personal financial statement reflects an $1,820 net monthly remainder and no\npayment progress on his delinquent debts, despite periods of gainful employment when\nhe enjoyed positive cash flows (see GEs 5 and 6; Tr. 106-09). He provided no\nrepayment plan to address his delinquent debts, and has sought no financial counseling.\n(Tr. 109)\n\n6\nEndorsements\nApplicant provided no endorsements, performance evaluations, or evidence of\ncommunity service.  Little is known about his work experience and personal life outside\nwhat of what was developed in the Government\u2019s exhibits.  \nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making\nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could\ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as considerations\nthat could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the \"[c]onditions\nthat could mitigate security concerns,\u201d if any. These guidelines must be considered\nbefore deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or\ndenied.  Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the\nenumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a\ndecision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent\nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in 2(a) of the AGs,\nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense\ndecision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context\nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period\nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the\napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct: (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security\nconcern if the individual has divided  loyalties or foreign financial interests,\nmay be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\n\n7\norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication\nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located,\nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign\ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. (see AG \u00b6 6)\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.  (AG, \u00b6 15)\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts. (AG, \u00b6 18)\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the revised AGs, a decision to\ngrant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence. See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 792-800\n(1988).  As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely,\nthe judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\n\n8\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation. Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the\nultimate burden of demonstrating his clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis\nApplicant is a former employee of a defense contractor who has family\nmembers who are both citizens and residents of Iraq. Trust concerns are raised under\nthe foreign influence guideline due to Applicant\u2019s longstanding family ties to Iraq.\nAlthough his contacts with family members residing in Iraq appear to somewhat\nlimited, they do involve his mother and five siblings.  He continues to maintain regular\ncontact with his mother and siblings. Until he ran into recent financial problems\nfollowing his lay-off, he regularly sent money to his family, and he has traveled every\ntwo or three years to Iraq to visit them.  Iraq is also a liberated ally of the U.S. that has\nencountered difficulty forming a government and avoiding a return to sectarian conflict\nthat has dominated the region for many years.\nSecurity concerns over Applicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions and his finances are also\nraised.  They are addressed as well.   \nForeign influence concerns\nKey to the Government\u2019s foreign influence concerns are Applicant\u2019s immediate\nfamily members who still reside in Iraq, a country in the process of establishing a\nstable democratic government able to protect all of its disparate constituent groups\nand maintain peace with its neighbors. Despite the encouraging developments in Iraq,\nthe country is still very dangerous and volatile in certain sectors. \nApplicant\u2019s historically close relationship with his living family members in Iraq\nmakes them potentially vulnerable to coercion and non-coercive measures because of\ntheir close familial family ties with Applicant. Because non-governmental entities\noperating in Iraq, as well as the former Iraqi military and intelligence authorities, have\n\n9\na history of violating Iraqi domestic laws and regulations, and international laws, they\nare more likely to use improper and/or illegal means to obtain classified information in\nApplicant\u2019s possession or control through his siblings and in-laws. \nBecause Applicant\u2019s contacts with his Iraqi family members occurred in a war\nzone, the Government urges security concerns over risks that his face to face and\ntelephonic contacts with his immediate family members might be subject to\nexploitation, coercion, or duress by Iraqi military and government authorities to access\nclassified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control.  Applicant\u2019s activities\nwarrant some application of two of the disqualifying conditions of the foreign influence\nguideline: DC \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d The citizenship/residence status of Applicant\u2019s\nsiblings in Iraq pose some potential concerns for Applicant because of the risks of\nundue foreign influence that could compromise sensitive or classified information\nunder Applicant\u2019s possession and/or control. \nAlthough none of Applicant\u2019s family members have any identified Iraqi military\nor government service, or other demonstrated links to the Iraqi government, they\nremain vulnerable to potential compromise and coercion for so long as they reside in\nIraq.  Were any of these family members to be placed in a hostage situation, Applicant\ncould be subject to conflicts over ensuring his family\u2019s well being and protecting\nclassified information.  For this reason, DC \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnection to a foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that\ninformation,\u201d is applicable to the facts of this case. \nTrue, neither Applicant\u2019s mother nor any of his siblings residing in Iraq have any\nhistory to date of being subjected to any coercion or influence. These historical\nantecedents do limit the severity of a conflict situation.  However, the absence of any\npast coercive measures taken by Iraqi authorities does not absolve Applicant from\ncoercive risks in the future given Iraq\u2019s checkered history of political instability,\nviolence,  hostage taking, and abusive measures taken against its own citizens.\nThe AGs governing security clearances do not dictate per se results or\nmandate particular outcomes for any chosen set of guidelines covering risks of foreign\ninfluence.  What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country may not\nbe in another. While foreign influence cases must by practical necessity be weighed\non a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for referencing.  Personnel security\nassessments necessarily embrace similar risk assessments under the new AGs for\nassessing foreign influence risks and concerns associated with the individual's having\nfamily abroad, which include both common sense assessments of country risks and\ninformation available from public sources. \n\n10\nUnlike the old Adjudicative Guidelines, though, the new ones do take into\naccount the country\u2019s demonstrated relations with the U.S. as an important\nconsideration in gauging whether the particular relatives with citizenship and residency\nelsewhere create a heightened security risk. The geopolitical aims and policies of the\nparticular foreign regime involved do matter. \nMitigation is not available to Appellant under the foreign influence guideline of\nthe AGs.  Based on his case-specific circumstances, mitigating condition (MC) \u00b6 8(a),\n\u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the persons or activities of these persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign a foreign individual, group, organization, or\ngovernment and the interests of the U.S.\u201d is not applicable to Applicant\u2019s\ncircumstances.   Information about Applicant\u2019s family members is too limited to permit\nsafe predictions about their future safety, and Applicant\u2019s exposure to risks of pressure\nand compromise of any of his family members currently residing in Iraq. \nOf some benefit to Applicant is MC \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either\nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s\ndemonstrated loyalty and commitment to the U.S. and its institutions and values and\nthe absence of any history of coercive measures taken against any of his family\nmembers residing in Iraq are sufficiently demonstrated to warrant some application of\nMC \u00b6 8(b).\nHeightened risks associated with Applicant\u2019s long concealed status of his\nmother and siblings cannot be safely discounted.  Iraq\u2019s strategic location and political\ncharacter and Applicant\u2019s case specific relationships with his immediate family\nmembers in Iraq combine to create pressing security concerns over risks of direct or\nindirect pressure or influence of a family member of Applicant\u2019s by Iraqi authorities, or\n(more likely) by terrorists or insurgents operating in Iraq.\nTo complete a  whole-person assessment of Applicant\u2019s foreign influence risks\nto ascertain whether they are fully compatible with the restoration of his security\nclearance, Applicant\u2019s U.S. citizenship and his wife\u2019s U.S. citizenship interests require\ncareful balancing. Whole-person assessment takes account of Applicant\u2019s immigration\nto the U.S. to pursue a better life for himself and his wife.  Without any character\nreferences, performance evaluations, or community credits to appraise his\ncommitments to the U.S., and responsibility at work and in his community, it is difficult\nto find evidence of positive contributions to neutralize risks associated with raised\nforeign influence concerns. \n\n11\nOverall, potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's relations with his\nmother, brothers, and sisters residing in Iraq (as Iraqi citizens), are insufficiently\nmitigated to permit safe predictive judgments about the ability of Applicant and his\nfamily members to withstand pressure, compromise, or coercion from government and\nnon-government sources in Iraq.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by Guideline B. \nFalsification concerns\nApplicant omitted his 1999 DUI arrest and 2007 criminal trespass arrest from\nthe e-QIP he completed in July 2008.\u201d By omitting his criminal arrests, Appellant failed\nto furnish materially important background information that was needed for the\nGovernment to properly process and evaluate his SF-86.\nApplicant does not challenge the omissions, but attributes them to haste,\nlanguage difficulties, and confusion over the meaning of the term \u201carrest.\u201d Despite his\nclaims, the questions as written in the e-QIP are straight-forward and manifestly\ncomprehensible to Applicant, given his level of education and experience at the time.\nHis omissions invite the application of the DC \u00b6 16(a) of the personal conduct\nguideline, \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d\nConsidering his arrest history, his court appearances associated with each\narrest, Applicant\u2019s guilty pleas associated with each arrest, and the plain wording of\nquestion 23 of his e-QIP, Applicant\u2019s omissions cannot be excused. His omissions\nwere made knowingly and wilfully under all of the circumstances, \nWhen interviewed two months later by an OPM agent, Applicant  disclosed his\narrests.  Review of his summary of interview reflects clear evidence of prompting by\nthe interviewing agent. Under the circumstances, his corrections cannot be considered\nsufficiently prompt and voluntary to enable him to take advantage of MC \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe\nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d Applicant\u2019s corrections do reflect\ncandid, sincere, and complete corrections.  Nonetheless, they fail to meet both the\nprompt and good-faith prongs of MC \u00b6 17(a), as these terms have generally been\ninterpreted by the Appeal Board.  \nTaking into account all of the evidence and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s two omitted arrests and his less than prompt and voluntary disclosures of\nthem when questioned by an OPM agent, conclusions warrant that the allegations are\nare not mitigated. Unfavorable conclusions are warranted with respect to the\nallegations covered by Guideline E. \n\n12\nFinancial concerns\nApplicant\u2019s admissions of the debts covered in the SOR negate the need for the\nGovernment to provide any independent proof of the debts.  But the Government has\ndocumented proof of the listed debts just the same.  The listed debts in the SOR are\nfully documented in his latest credit reports and provide ample independent proof of\nthe debts. Applicant does not dispute any of the debts.  Accumulation of these debts,\nand his past inability to pay, or otherwise address them, warrant the application of two\nof the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines: DC \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and DC \u00b6 19(c)) \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d\nHolding a security clearance involves a fiduciary relationship between the\nGovernment and the clearance holder. Quite apart from any agreement the clearance\nholder may have signed with the Government, the nature of the clearance holder\u2019s\nduties and access to classified information necessarily imposes important duties of\ntrust and candor on the clearance holder that are considerably higher than those\ntypically imposed on government employees and contractors involved in other lines of\ngovernment business. (see Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980))\nFailure of an applicant to make more concerted efforts to pay or resolve his debts\nwhen able to do so raises security-significant concerns about the sufficiency of the\napplicant\u2019s demonstrated trust and judgment necessary to safeguard classified\ninformation.\nExtenuating circumstances are very limited.  To a large extent, Applicant\u2019s\nlisted debts involve credit card accounts that he used to gamble with before he\nrelocated to his current state of residence.  Loss of employment has hampered his\nability to address his debts., but his unemployment alone does not explain his failure\nto demonstrate any repayment efforts with his creditors.  Consequently, MC  \u00b6 20(b) of\nthe financial considerations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the\nindividual acted responsibly,\u201d has  limited application to Applicant\u2019s circumstances. \nTaking into account all of the documented facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s financial history, the limited extenuating circumstances associated with his\naccumulation of the debts, and his inability to address any of them without full time\nemployment, Applicant cannot be credited with mitigating financial concerns and\nrestoring the state of his finances to stable levels commensurate with the minimum\nrequirements for holding a security clearance.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with\nrespect to the allegations covered by Guideline F.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the factors and conditions enumerated in AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\n13\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following\nseparate formal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE B (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubpara. 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubpara. 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubpara. 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubpara. 1.d:\n           Against Applicant\nGUIDELINE E ([PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubpara. 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubpara. 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparas. 3.a through 3.k:\nAgainst Applicant \n Conclusions\n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified\ninformation.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nSeptember 15, 2011\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn November 17, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline G\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn December 13, 2010, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and he\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on March 2, 2011. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 4,\n2011, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 30, 2011. The Government\noffered Exhibits 1 through 9, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on\nhis own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through K at the time of hearing, which were\nalso admitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open\nuntil April 13, 2011, to submit a one page letter, which had been previously identified and\nentered into evidence without objection as Exhibit F, although it had not been physically\n\n2\npresent at the time of the hearing. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on\nApril 7, 2011. Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and the testimony of\nApplicant, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a. through 1.e., under\nGuideline G. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 31 years old. He is unmarried, and he has no children.  He served in\nthe United States Navy from 2000 to 2005, when he received an Honorable Discharge.\nApplicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance\nin connection with his employment in the defense sector.\n(Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption) \nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has\nengaged in excessive alcohol consumption. The following are the five allegations as they\nare cited in the SOR, and as reviewed above, 1. a. through 1.e. have been admitted by\nApplicant in his RSOR :\n1.a. Applicant has \u201cconsumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of\nintoxication, from approximately 1997 to at least December 2007.\u201d \n1.b. On November 29, 2006, a Statement of Reasons was issued to Applicant\nwhich alleged two alcohol related incidents. A hearing was conducted, and the findings\nof the Administrative Judge in his decision included the following: \ni. Applicant \u201cconsumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of\nintoxication, from approximately 1997 to at least June 2006.\u201d \nii. On October 31, 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1)\nDriving Under the Influence of Alcohol and/or Drugs and (2) Driving Under the Influence\nof Alcohol with BAC of .08 or More. He pled No Contest to Count (2) and he was placed\non five years probation, 96 days confinement, four days of volunteer work and to attend\nand complete a Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) program. \niii. On November 3, 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1)\nDriving Under the Influence of Alcohol and/or Drugs and (2) Driving Under the Influence\nof Alcohol with BAC of .08 or More. He pled No Contest to Count (2) and he was placed\non five years probation, fined $1,700, ordered to participate in a public service program,\ncomplete a three month first conviction program and to finish a MADD program.\n\n3\n1.c. During the period when the Administrative Judge was making his deliberation\nregarding Applicant\u2019s case, and before a favorable decision was issued in August 2007,\nApplicant was arrested a third time for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol. \n1.d. Applicant received alcohol related counseling on or about January 2004,  at a\nSubstance Abuse Rehabilitation Program Applicant through the United States Navy, for\na condition diagnosed Alcohol Abuse.\n1.e. In July 2007, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Driving Under the\nInfluence of Alcohol and/or Drugs and (2) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol with\nBAC of .08 or More. He pled Guilty. The imposition of the sentence was suspended for\nfive years. He was sentences to jail, ordered to pay a fine and fees, ordered to complete\na multiple conviction program, and attend a MADD program. Applicant\u2019s license was\nsuspended and an ignition interlock device was ordered for his vehicle. \nApplicant testified that as a result of this conviction, he spent 45 days in a\ndetention facility. He had been sentenced to 90 days because of time served credit and\nbecause he enrolled in a work furlough program where he was in a kind of half-way\nhouse for 23 or 24 days, when not at his employment.  (Tr t 33-34.)\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he still consumes alcohol. The last time he\nconsumed alcohol prior to the hearing was on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, March 17, 2011,\napproximately one month before the hearing. He stated that at that time he drank two\nbeers.  Prior to that he estimated that he last consumed three beers on the previous New\nYear\u2019s Eve. He estimated that in 2010, he drank about four times, and he had as many\nas four beers on at least one or two occasions. After Applicant\u2019s arrest in 2007, he drank\nalcohol on one occasion before he was incarcerated, and then he abstained completely\nfor approximately six months before he began consuming alcohol again. Since that time\nhe estimates that he drinks about three to five times a year on special occasions. (Tr at\n27-31, 52-54.) Applicant attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings not regularly, but\napproximately once a month. (Tr at 36.)\nApplicant testified at the current hearing that he would not get a DUI in the future.\nHis reasoning was because he has been incarcerated and in a work furlough program,\nneither of which had ever happened to him before, and this would result in a different\noutcome. However during Applicant\u2019s testimony, Department Counsel pointed out that\nApplicant had promised he would not get another DUI at his previous hearing in 2007,\nbut despite his promise, he did receive another DUI. (Tr at 59-60.)\nMitigation\nApplicant submitted a number of documents to attempt to mitigate the SOR\nallegations. They include but are not limited to the following: four character letters.\n(Exhibits C, D, and K.) The first is from his supervisor from January 2008 until the\npresent. He wrote about Applicant, \u201che has not demonstrated any behavior that would\nindicate irresponsibility or deliberate compromise of classified information or material if\ngranted access.\u201d  Another letter was from the site leader and program manager for the\n\n4\nfacility of Applicant\u2019s employer. He wrote Applicant\u2019s \u201cdedication and efforts have\nresulted in both verbal and written compliments.\u201d  Exhibit E is a letter from a Brigadier\nGeneral of the United States Air Force in which he congratulated Applicant for the\n\u201cextraordinary support\u201d given to United States service members. \nExhibit F is a letter from a counselor for the Employee Assistance Program for\nApplicant\u2019s employer, indicating that she met with Applicant after his last DUI, and that\nhis court ordered attendance at the Driving Under the Influence Program is appropriate\nand sufficient follow up care. Exhibit I is a Notice of Complection Certificate showing that\nApplicant finished an 18 month Driving Under the Influence Program multiple offender\nprogram. Exhibit J includes AA attendance slips establishing that Applicant attended\nmultiple AA meetings. Exhibit K included a Letter of Commendation and two certificates\nfor Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals that Applicant\u2019s earned during his time\nin the Navy. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\n(Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption) \nApplicant's alcohol consumption has resulted in three DUI arrests and convictions,\nand a diagnosis of Alcohol Abuse from a substance abuse counselor. \nThe Government established that Applicant was involved in \u201calcohol-related\nincidents away from work,\u201d and \u201cbinge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgement.\u201d Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 22(a) and (c) apply to this case.  \nAs reviewed above, Applicant underwent a security hearing in 2007, during which\nhe promised that he would not receive any further DUI arrests and convictions. Yet\nbefore the decision was actually issued, he received his third DUI arrest and conviction.\nAfter Applicant served his sentence in the detention facility, he abstained from\nconsuming alcohol for about six months. Yet at the current hearing, he admitted to\nconsuming alcohol again, and he currently drinks alcohol, usually beer, approximately\nfour times a year, consuming as many as three or four beers at one time. This is despite\nthe fact that Applicant has been advised not to consume any alcohol in the future at the\nAA meetings that he attends sporadically, and he has received a diagnosis of Alcohol\nAbuse. As a result of this, I do not find that any Mitigating Condition under \u00b6 23 applies.\nGuideline G is found against Applicant.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\n\n6\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited above\nas to why the disqualifying conditions apply and the mitigating conditions do not apply, I\nfind that the record evidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole-person\nconcept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.- 1.e.:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 34-year-old administrative assistant who has worked for the same defense contractor since March 2005. At age 17, he earned a high school diploma and joined the National Guard, in which he served for six years. He has completed some college-level course work. Married in 2002, Applicant and his wife have two young children, a two-and-a-half-year-old and a nine-month-old infant. At the time of the incident at issue, he had an interim security clearance, which had been granted in March 2005. On September 17, 2006, Applicant visited a friend who lived in a relatively rural area a couple of hours away. For the visit, Applicant took his registered Remington 870 Express shotgun with an 18\u201d barrel. He originally purchased the shotgun for home protection and occasionally used it at a shooting range. He wanted to use it on the trip to go shooting with his friend, which he did.1 When he left the friend\u2019s house, Applicant put the shotgun on the backseat of his sports car, along with a clothing bag, and stored the gun shells in the car\u2019s console compartment. On his way home, Applicant proceeded to a major highway. As he merged into the flow of traffic from a ramp into the right lane of highway, a large SUV in the same lane traveling at a higher speed approached Applicant\u2019s vehicle from behind.

On July 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December \n29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n \nOn August 11, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and admitted the one \nallegation. He also requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge. I was \nassigned the case on September 9, 2009. The parties proposed an October 20, 2009, \nhearing date, and a Notice of Hearing was issued on September 23, 2009. \n \n \n1 \n \nNovember 13, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                           \nThe hearing took place as scheduled. Applicant gave testimony, introduced one \ncharacter witness, and offered five documents, which I accepted into the record without \nobjection as Exhibits (Exs.) A-E.  Also accepted without objection were five documents \nfrom Department Counsel, marked as Exs. 1-5. Applicant was given through October \n23, 2009, to submit any additional materials, but none were submitted. The transcript \n(Tr.) was received on October 28, 2009, and the record was closed. Based upon a \nreview of the case file, exhibits, and testimony, security clearance is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old administrative assistant who has worked for the same \ndefense contractor since March 2005. At age 17, he earned a high school diploma and \njoined the National Guard, in which he served for six years. He has completed some \ncollege-level course work. Married in 2002, Applicant and his wife have two young \nchildren, a two-and-a-half-year-old and a nine-month-old infant. At the time of the \nincident at issue, he had an interim security clearance, which had been granted in \nMarch 2005. \n \nOn September 17, 2006, Applicant visited a friend who lived in a relatively rural \narea a couple of hours away. For the visit, Applicant took his registered Remington 870 \nExpress shotgun with an 18\u201d barrel. He originally purchased the shotgun for home \nprotection and occasionally used it at a shooting range. He wanted to use it on the trip \nto go shooting with his friend, which he did.1 When he left the friend\u2019s house, Applicant \nput the shotgun on the backseat of his sports car, along with a clothing bag, and stored \nthe gun shells in the car\u2019s console compartment.  \n \nOn his way home, Applicant proceeded to a major highway.  As he merged into \nthe flow of traffic from a ramp into the right lane of highway, a large SUV in the same \nlane traveling at a higher speed approached Applicant\u2019s vehicle from behind. The SUV \ndriver did not slow down to give Applicant an opportunity to fully merge into the flow of \ntraffic, nor did he move to the next lane to pass. Instead, the SUV driver pushed closer \ntoward Applicant\u2019s car, a pony-class-sized vehicle. As he got close to Applicant\u2019s car\u2019s \nbumper, Applicant pumped his brakes about two times to signal the SUV to slow down \nor back off.2 The SUV was traveling sufficiently close and at such speed that the \npumping of Applicant\u2019s brakes caused the SUV driver to almost hit Applicant\u2019s vehicle.3 \nThe SUV driver then changed to the left lane, drove along side Applicant\u2019s car, rolled \ndown his window, and yelled \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d4  \n \n1  Tr. 24, 35. \n \n2 Tr. 19-20, 25 (\u201cAt first he just came up on me and tailgated me for a short while. And you know how you \ntap your brakes to get somebody to back off a little bit?\u201d  Compare Ex. 3 (Sheriff\u2019s Report, dated Sep. 17, \n2006) at 4 (\u201c. . . as [the SUV] got close to [Applicant\u2019s] bumper, [Applicant] hit the brakes two times very \nhard. . . . \u201c) \n \n3 Ex. 4, note 1, supra. \n \n4  Id. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                           \n \nIn pumping his brakes, Applicant\u2019s shotgun and clothing bag started to fall from \nthe backseat to the floor.5 Applicant instinctively reached back to grab the firearm from \nfalling and caught it.6  He lifted the shotgun, which was approximately two and a half \nfeet in length, with his right hand and brought it toward the front passenger seat as he \nsteered with his left hand.7 He then managed to steer the vehicle with his right hand as \nhe switched the firearm to his left hand, holding it vertically between the driver\u2019s seat \nand the car door interior. By this point, the SUV had pulled along side Applicant\u2019s \nvehicle and its driver was yelling. Applicant made sure the other driver could see the \nunloaded shotgun for a few seconds.8 The SUV driver who had been yelling at \nApplicant misidentified what Applicant held in his left hand as a rifle and later claimed he \nsaw Applicant loading the firearm.9 The shotgun is capable of being loaded vertically \nwith one hand, but the maneuver would be \u201cdifficult.\u201d10 Applicant\u2019s gesture and \nperceived movements scared the SUV driver.11  Not anticipating the turn of events as \nhe perceived them, the SUV driver finally backed off. He then called the police on his \ncell phone. Rather than again switching hands between the steering wheel and the \nfirearm, Applicant lowered the shotgun down with his left hand and let it rest on the car \nfloor between the driver\u2019s seat and the car door. He then continued his drive thinking, \n\u201cthank goodness that\u2019s over.

As they tailed Applicant, the police \nsaw movement from within his vehicle and concluded he might be concealing a firearm. \nAt the time, however, Applicant was on his cell phone talking with his wife.13 The \nvehicles came to a stop and the police approached Applicant\u2019s vehicle.

No other witnesses were identified, however, and only Applicant\u2019s \nand the SUV driver\u2019s versions of the facts were included in the sheriff\u2019s report.17 \nInasmuch as it was Applicant\u2019s first brush with the law, he was nervous and \nembarrassed.18 When asked whether the SUV driver\u2019s actions had made him mad, \nApplicant answered \u201cI guess.\u201d19 When told to answer whether Applicant was \u201cscared \nand showed the gun to let [the SUV driver] know [he] was not playing\u201d or had \u201cpointed \nthe gun at [the SUV driver] maliciously with the gun loaded,\u201d Applicant was given no \nother options for an answer.20 Consequently, he answered: \u201cIt was more of the first \noption.\u201d21 Applicant felt he was being manipulated by the officer.22 Applicant explained \nthat he was worried the tailgating SUV driver would hit his smaller vehicle.

In pleading guilty to that \ncharge, $581 in fines and costs were levied and paid, and Applicant received the same \nsuspended sentence and period of unsupervised probation.27 The court took no action \nsuspending Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license and no rehabilitative coursework was ordered. \nHis probationary period ends on December 12, 2009. \n \nSince the incident at issue, Applicant and his wife have started a family. They \nnow have an infant and a toddler. With the additions to their family came issues \nregarding safety. Applicant traded in his pony-class sports car for a family sized vehicle. \nHe no longer owns a firearm. He is active with his local home owner\u2019s association and is \ngetting to know his neighbors.28 He and his wife are currently looking for a new church \nwhich will fit their family\u2019s needs.29 The transition to being a \u201cfamily man\u201d has brought \nabout other changes: \u201cmy biggest thing is having kids. They\u2019ve really changed me a lot. \nI love my kids and want to be a positive role model for them and so you know I\u2018m \nalways very aware of what I say and what I do around them.

Again, all I want to be is a \nperfect or good role model for my children or for others, anyone else that \nmay associate with me.31   \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife described the incident at issue as being out of character for \nApplicant. She was genuinely surprised to hear he had been involved in such a \nsituation. She emphasized that since Applicant\u2019s conviction and in the wake of the birth \nof their children, she has \u201cabsolutely\u201d noted a change in his behavior: \u201c[H]is patience \nhas grown. He is very patient. He was before. It\u2019s just that seeing him grow as a father \nin relating to our children is the biggest change in him.

The guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthey are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a \nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.

Department Counsel further argued: \u201cIf he were not on the outstanding probation, then we would \nhave here a single, serious crime or allegation or admission of criminal conduct. And it would be your \ndecision, Your Honor, to decide the applicability of remaining conditions. Generally, yes, three years \npassage of time with an isolated incident, the Government submits that Your Honor could find that he\u2019s \nsuccessfully rehabilitated and nothing has happened since \u2013 in this three year period.\u201d Tr. 75. \n\n \n7 \n \n                                           \nis the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor \nof national security.\u201d  \n \nIn reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are \nreasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. The \ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nAn applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d39 The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of \nevidence.40 The ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision \nis on the applicant.41   \n  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d EO 12968, Section 3.1(b), lists multiple prerequisites for access to \nclassified or sensitive information. The Appeal Board has stated that \u201c(t)he clearly \nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they \nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d42 Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant \nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of \nprotecting such sensitive information.43  The decision to deny an individual a security \nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.44 It is \nmerely an indication that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and \nthe Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \n39 See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995). \n \n40 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n41 ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995). \n \n42 Id. \n \n43 Id. \n \n44 EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n8 \n \nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative \nguideline to be the most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case: \n \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct. The Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt \nabout a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.45  \n \nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those that would mitigate security \nconcerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below. \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe facts show that in September 2006, while he was being intimidated by \nanother driver on a major highway, Applicant brandished a firearm. They also show that \nhis placement of the firearm was determined to constitute concealment. At the time, he \nhad an interim security clearance. Applicant pled guilty to the two resultant \nmisdemeanor charges.  Although he has satisfactorily completed all other aspects of his \nsentence, less than a month remains on the 36 months of unsupervised probation \nordered by the court. Consequently, Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) \nAG \u00b6 31(a) (\u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d), CC DC AG \u00b6 31(c) \n(\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was \nformally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted\u201d), and CC DC  AG \u00b6 31(d) \n(\u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation\u201d) apply. With disqualifying conditions \nraised, consideration must be given to the mitigating conditions noted under AG \u00b6 32. \n \nApplicant admitted to the criminal misdemeanor charges and to the related \nallegations set forth in the SOR. The incident at issue occurred in September 2006, over \nthree years ago. Applicant was not sentenced until December 12, 2006. His court \nordered period of unsupervised probation ends on December 12, 2009, less than a \nmonth from the date of this decision. Applicant admits he used poor judgment in \nescalating matters further when he was confronted by an aggressive driver. Although he \ncontinues to drive over the crowded roads and highways that sprawl about his region, \nhe has not been involved in any subsequent incidents of a criminal, civil, or antisocial \nnature in the past 35 months. Regardless, his probation is still pending, congested \nhighways continue to be a local problem in Applicant\u2019s region, and his behavior at the \ntime demonstrated poor judgment. Consequently, neither Criminal Conduct Mitigating \nCondition (CC MC) AG \u00b6 32(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d) nor AG \u00b6 32(c) (\u201cevidence the person did not commit the act\u201d) applies. \n \n                                            \n45 AG \u00b6 30. \n\n \n9 \n \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s actions on September 17, 2006, constituted serious \nmisdemeanors of a criminal nature, the other party in the matter is not blameless. Even \nthe sheriff\u2019s report notes facts indicating that the SUV driver was aggressive. The SUV \ndriver declined to move into the next lane and permit Applicant to move at his own pace \nin the right lane, the lane generally accepted as being the proper lane for merging \nvehicles and slower traffic. Behind the wheel of a much larger SUV, he tried to tailgate \nor \u201cpush\u201d Applicant\u2019s much smaller vehicle to a higher speed. The SUV driver was \ndissatisfied that his prodding was unsuccessful and apparently became incensed when \nApplicant pumped his brakes as a signal for the SUV driver to slow down or back off. \nFoiled in his maneuvers, the SUV driver moved to the next lane, drove along side \nApplicant\u2019s vehicle, rolled down his window, and began yelling at Applicant. A blameless \ndriver would simply have changed lanes and moved on. The SUV driver, however, \nremained aggressive until his tactics yielded a response he did not anticipate. Granted, \nApplicant\u2019s response was illegal and disproportionate to the circumstances. Although \nthese facts do not raise CC MC AG \u00b6 32(b) (\u201cthe person was pressured or coerced into \ncommitting the act and those pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life\u201d), they \nmerit some consideration in putting the entire incident into perspective.   \n \nThe fact Applicant is still on probation demands and received heightened \nscrutiny. With less than a month of unsupervised probation remaining, however, it is \nnotable that there have been no recurrences of either criminal or civil misconduct, \nantisocial behavior, or driving violations. Indeed, in the interim, Applicant became a \nfather for the first time. A second baby was born within the past year. He has traded in \nhis sports car for a family car, disposed of his only firearm, become active in his home \nowners\u2019 association, is looking for a new church suitable for his growing family, \ndemonstrated maturation and increased patience, assumed the role of family man, and \nlearned from his past misconduct. At work, he has earned the respect of his peers and \nhis newest supervisor. As demonstrated by his credible testimony and recent behavior, \nhe is genuinely contrite over the incident at issue. Consequently, CC MC AG \u00b6 32(d) \n(\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage \nof time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement\u201d) \napplies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. In reviewing the complete record, I \nconsidered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts \nand circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors noted \nabove.  \n \nApplicant is a credible and soft spoken man who, in 2006 at age 31, displayed an \nisolated and uncharacteristic outburst of aggression which resulted in two criminal \nmisdemeanor charges.46 He pled guilty to the misdemeanors at issue, paid both his \nfines and costs, complied with the court\u2019s sentencing, and completed over 35 of 36 \nmonths of unsupervised probation.47 His license was not suspended and he was not \nordered to attend any form of driver\u2019s training or aggressiveness counseling. Applicant \nis credibly contrite and humbled by the incident, which he now views as a significant \nlearning experience.48 While he takes responsibility for his actions, the aggressive \ntactics employed by the SUV driver initially created the air of aggression that eventually \nprovoked Applicant\u2019s, albeit needless and disproportionate, response.49 Since his \nconviction, he has substantially completed almost 98% of his unsupervised probation \nwithout incident. \n \nAlthough he is humbled and embarrassed by the experience, Applicant has \nmade no secret of his arrest. Consequently, it provides little weight as a basis for \nexploitation.50 In learning from his mistake and taking responsibility for his actions, he \nhas matured.51 This maturation was complemented by the birth of two young children, \nwhich has made him refocus his life, strive to become a role model, and increase his \ncapacity for patience.52  He traded in his sports car for a more sensible family vehicle \nand he no longer owns a firearm.53  Rather than practice his marksmanship with friends \nin the country, he emphasizes socializing with his neighbors, attending church as a \n \n46 AG \u00b6 2(a)(1), AG \u00b6 2(a)(3),  and AG \u00b6 2(a)(4). \n \n47 AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). \n \n48 AG \u00b6 2(a)(9). \n \n49 AG \u00b6 2(a)(2), AG \u00b6 2(a)(5), and AG \u00b6 2(a)(7). \n \n50 AG \u00b6 2(a)(8). \n \n51 AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). \n \n52 Id. \n \n53 Id. \n \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nfamily, concentrating on his work, and trying to serve as a role model for his children \nand professional peers.54 \n \nApplicant\u2019s maturation and personal efforts over the past three years mitigate \nsecurity concerns regarding his past criminal conduct and his misdemeanor convictions. \nWhile it is true that Appellant still has a few weeks left on his unsupervised probation, \nthe fact he is on probation only raises another disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 31. It \ndoes not, however, automatically and conclusively disqualify an applicant from \npossessing a security clearance. Like other disqualifying conditions noted under AG \u00b6 \n31, it can be mitigated by those conditions enumerated under AG \u00b6  32.  \n \nThe misdemeanors described above raised disqualifying conditions that were \nmitigated through Applicant\u2019s maturation and personal efforts. The disqualifying \ncondition raised by his probation merits additional scrutiny, but I find it, too, is mitigated \nthrough the same facts and considerations. Indeed, with over 35 of 36 months of \nunsupervised probation already successfully completed, and given both the facts of \nrecord and the totality of the circumstances, there is no evidence or indication that he \nwill not successfully complete his entire probation within the month. To strictly hold \nApplicant to the full 36 months of probation before accepting the Government\u2019s position \nthat three years is sufficient time to demonstrate rehabilitation would be a senseless \nembracement of form over substance and would undermine the policy dictating that the \nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Moreover, it would serve no genuine purpose, \nwould not otherwise alter the facts regarding rehabilitation underlying the whole person \nanalysis, and would prove to be unnecessarily punitive within the context of this \nadministrative process. This is especially true given the fact Applicant has an otherwise \nunblemished record, has been incident-free for well over three years since the incident \nat issue, and presents no genuine risk that he would  deliberately or inadvertently fail to \nprotect or safeguard classified information. Having reviewed all these facts and \ncircumstances, as well as Applicant\u2019s personal growth and the mitigating conditions \nraised, I find that sufficient time has passed, and more than sufficient rehabilitation has \noccurred, to mitigate all the criminal conduct security concerns and related disqualifying \nconditions at issue. Clearance is granted.       \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n54 Id. \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

During the hearing, Applicant changed his answer pertaining to SOR \u00b6 1.c. and admitted the allegation.6 Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. He denied the remaining factual allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.d. through 1.g., 1.j. through 1.q., and 2.a.) of the SOR.

Eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance and access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 22, 2008, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the \ninterrogatories on April 27, 2009.2 On another unspecified date, DOHA issued him \nanother set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on May 28, 2009.3 \n \n1 Government Exhibit 1 (SF 86), dated July 22, 2008. \n \n2 Government Exhibit 3 (Applicant\u2019s Answers to Interrogatories, dated April 27, 2009).  \n \n3 Government Exhibit 2 (Applicant\u2019s Answers to Interrogatories, dated May 28, 2009). \nJune 14, 2011\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nOn June 9, 2010, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and \nmodified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For \nAccess to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) for all adjudications and \nother determinations made under the Directive. The SOR alleged security concerns \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and \ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on June 11, 2010. In a sworn statement, dated June \n25, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on September \n28, 2010, and the case was assigned to Administrative Judge Arthur E. Marshall, Jr., on \nOctober 8, 2010. A Notice of Hearing was issued on November 5, 2010, but Applicant \nfailed to appear at the hearing scheduled for December 14, 2010. The case was \nreassigned to me on February 2, 2011. A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 2, \n2011, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on March 23, 2011. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, six Government exhibits (GE 1-6) and seven Applicant \nexhibits (AE A-G) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The \nhearing transcript (Tr.) was received on March 31, 2011. The record was kept open until \nApril 6, 2011, to enable Applicant to supplement it. It also remained open until April 18, \n2011, to enable the parties to submit written closing arguments.  \n \nRulings on Procedure \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel moved to withdraw two allegations \nbecause the evidence would correctly reflect that the federal tax lien (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) and \nthe state tax lien (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) identified as being Applicant\u2019s were, in fact, not \nApplicant\u2019s debts. The motion was granted.4 Department Counsel also moved to \nwithdraw three allegations because the evidence would show that they were actually \nduplicates of three other allegations. The motion was granted.5 Accordingly, SOR \u00b6 1.o. \nwas withdrawn as a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.l.; SOR \u00b6 1.p. was withdrawn as a duplicate of \nSOR \u00b6 1.m.; and SOR \u00b6 1.q. was withdrawn as a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.n. \n \n \n \n4 Tr. at 16-18. \n \n5 Id. at 93-94. \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted two of the factual allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 \n1.h. and 1.i.) of the SOR. During the hearing, Applicant changed his answer pertaining \nto SOR \u00b6 1.c. and admitted the allegation.6 Applicant's admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. He denied the remaining factual allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.d. \nthrough 1.g., 1.j. through 1.q., and 2.a.) of the SOR. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as \na senior software engineer and computer system security analyst manager.7 He is \nseeking to retain a top secret security clearance. Applicant has a master\u2019s degree in \npolitical science and a master\u2019s degree in business administration.8 Over the years, \nApplicant has held several different positions with various employers. He was a security \nanalyst from July 1998 until December 1999,9 and a computer systems security analyst \nmanager from December 1999 until December 2006.10 He joined his current employer \nin December 2006.11 Applicant has never served with the U.S. military,12 although he \nattended U.S. Marine Corps officer candidate school for five weeks before opting out of \nfurther service.13 \n \nApplicant was married in March 2005.14 His wife has two children, a daughter \n(born in 1985) and a son (born in 1989).15 \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nIn June 2002, Applicant purchased a condominium to serve as his primary \nresidence.16 Because he qualified for a larger loan than he needed for the purchase, in \nJanuary 2003, he decided to start building wealth by accumulating investment \n \n6 Id. at 30-31. \n \n7 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 1, at 13; Government Exhibit 2 (Personal Subject Interview, dated \nOctober 6, 2008), at 1, attached to Applicant\u2019s Answers to Interrogatories. \n \n8 Tr. at 6. \n \n9 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 1, at 15-16. \n \n10 Id. at 14-15. \n \n11 Id. at 13. \n \n12 Id. at 26. \n \n13 Government Exhibit 2 (Personal Subject Interview), supra note 7, at 2. \n \n14 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 1, at 17-18. \n \n15 Id. at 20-21. \n \n16 Tr. at 35, 38, 47. \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nproperties.17 His credit was excellent, and banks and mortgage lenders kept soliciting \nhim to finance new properties or refinance existing ones.18 His initial purchase of an \ninvestment property occurred in January 2003.19 Over the next two and one-half years, \nApplicant purchased other older rental properties, sold one property at a profit, and \nconverted his wife\u2019s former residence into a rental property. During that period, his \nannual income was between $100,000 and $107,000, and the banks and mortgage \nlenders performed investment analyses before issuing him mortgage loans.20  \n \nApplicant\u2019s investment properties were all rented with rents sufficient to cover the \nrespective mortgage payments.21 He fixed up the properties, and they all appreciated in \nvalue.22 Rental traffic was good, and Applicant had lists of potential renters.23 At one \npoint, because of his successes in his real estate ventures, one bank urged him to \nrefinance six properties at one time, and he did so.24 Applicant continued his acquisition \nof investment properties, but did not lose sight of a contingency plan in the event of  \nsome future potential problems. His primary contingency plan was to keep his \nproperties rented, but he believed he would be able to cover lost rents if two or three \nproperties were vacant for a couple of months.25 No one predicted a devastated local \nhousing market with no renters.26 \n \nThere was nothing unusual about Applicant\u2019s finances until the latter part of  \n2007 when, because of the downturn in the economy, he started to lose renters in his \ninvestment properties. Tenants lost their jobs and were unable to pay the monthly rent, \nforcing Applicant to commence eviction proceedings.27 When the local housing market \ncrashed, some renters simply relocated to better facilities with subsidies under the U.S. \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Housing Choice Voucher \nProgram called Section 8.28 In an effort to mitigate his losses, Applicant advertised his \nproperties, listed the properties with the Section 8 program, and reduced his rental \n \n17 Id. at 35, 37. \n \n18 Id. at 74. \n \n19 Id. at 32, 35. \n \n20 Id. at 70. \n \n21 Id. at 76. \n \n22 Id. at 71, 76. \n \n23 Id. at 73. \n \n24 Id. at 74. \n \n25 Id. at 80. \n \n26 Id. at 80-81. \n \n27 Id. at 69-71. \n \n28 Id. at 71-72. \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nasking price.29 He continued making his mortgage payments from personal savings.30 \nHe even took credit card cash advances to keep making his payments.31 Properties in \nthe neighborhood, including his own, started becoming vacant, and then thieves started \nstripping the vacant houses by removing air conditioners, hot water heaters, plumbing, \netc.32  \n \nTo protect his interests, Applicant allowed one family to remain in one of his \nproperties even though they could not pay the rent, because they served as a security \nagainst vandalism.33 He spoke to his realtor about the possibility of selling his \nproperties, but was told there was nothing moving in the area.34 Applicant sought help \nfrom his mortgage lenders, advising them of the situation, but they would not offer him \nany assistance.35 Because his mortgages were linked to investment properties rather \nthan a primary residence, Applicant did not qualify for any of the federal loan \nmodification programs.36 At some point in September 2007, Applicant decided to stop \nusing personal funds and credit cards to pay his investment property taxes, mortgages, \nand other expenses.37 He was capable of meeting his personal and family financial \nobligations, but could no longer satisfy his investment obligations.38 As a result, several \ncredit card and mortgage accounts fell into arrears and became delinquent. \n \nThe SOR identified 17 purportedly continuing delinquencies, as reflected by \ncredit reports from 2008,39 2009,40 and 2010,41 totaling approximately $485,334, in \ncharged-off, past due, tax liens, or foreclosure accounts. Some accounts reflected in the \ncredit reports have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection \nagents. Other accounts are referenced repeatedly, in many instances duplicating other \naccounts listed, either under the same creditor name or under a different creditor name. \nSome accounts are identified by complete account numbers, while others are identified \n \n \n29 Id. at 73. \n \n30 Id. \n \n31 Id. \n \n32 Id. at 75, 77. \n \n33 Id. at 77. \n \n34 Id. at 78. \n \n35 Id. \n \n36 Id. at 80. \n \n37 Government Exhibit 2 (Personal Subject Interview), supra note 7, at 4. \n \n38 Id. \n \n39 Government Exhibit 6 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated July 26, 2008). \n \n40 Government Exhibit 5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated September 1, 2009). \n \n41 Government Exhibit 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated March 15, 2010). \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \ne property.  \n                                                          \nby partial account numbers, in some instances eliminating the last four digits and in \nothers eliminating other digits.

The SOR alleges Applicant deliberately \nfailed to disclose complete information in response to the following financial question: \u00a7 \n28a - (In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?). \nAppellant answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question, and identified two delinquent credit card \naccounts.92 He did not list any of his delinquent mortgage accounts or other delinquent \naccounts which came within the scope of the question (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. through 1.h., 1.j., \n1.l., and 1.m.). However, in response to another inquiry, Applicant indicated he had \u201ctax \nliens on investment property due to the downturn in the real estate market,\u201d and \u201clien for \ntaxes due on investment property.\u201d93 In a separate section, under additional comments, \nhe added:94 \n \nAs a real estate investor, I have experienced some financial problems due \nto the downturn in the real estate market that have affected my personal \ncredit. Since 2003, I have accumulated several properties that are now \ndifficult to sell and difficult to rent. The downturn has not affected my \npersonal property or personal income from work. I reported this to my \nSecurity Officer via email in 2007 when things began to change for me. \n \nApplicant denied intending to convey a false impression and contended he had \n\u201cinadvertently\u201d failed to specifically list his investment properties and essentially limited \nhis response to his \u201cpersonal\u201d finances.95 It should be noted that the financial questions \nin the SF 86 do not differentiate between personal and business accounts. At the time \nhe made his responses, Applicant was clearly aware that his investment property \ndelinquencies were well over $100,000, but he did not consider his real estate to be \n\u201cpersonal\u201d property, even though they were all titled in his name and not as a separate \ncorporate entity.96 Under those circumstances, Applicant failed to answer the question \ncompletely, correctly, and truthfully, and deliberately parsed words in omitting critical \nfacts from his response. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d97 As Commander in Chief, \n \n SF 86, supra note 1, at 33-34. \n Id. at 33. \n Id. at 36. \n Government Exhibit 2 (Personal Subject Interview), supra note 7, at 3; Tr. at 103-104. \n Tr. at 103. \n Department of the Navy v.

The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his \ndesignee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a \nfinding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d98   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d99 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, \nextenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s \ncase. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.100  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n98 Exec.

Under AG \u00b6 \n16(a), a \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility \n \nApplicant\u2019s omission in his response to the one inquiry in the SF 86 of critical \ninformation pertaining to financial delinquencies, provides sufficient evidence to \nexamine if his submission was a deliberate falsification, as alleged in the SOR, or was \nthe result of an inadvertent omission or \n                                            \n104 The Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \nthe burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to \nxplain the omission.  \nISCR Case No. 03-10390 at 8 (App. Bd.

He never stated that he \nhad mortgage delinquencies or foreclosures, and that was a significant omission, \nespecially since the titles to the investment properties were in his name and not in the \nname of a separate corporate entity. Under those circumstances, Applicant failed to \nanswer the question completely, correctly, and truthfully. His explanation is \nunreasonable and leads me to conclude that he deliberately falsified his response. AG \u00b6 \n16(a) has been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. AG \u00b6 17(a) may apply if \u201cthe individual made \nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before \nbeing confronted with the facts.\u201d Similarly, if \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time \nhas passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c) may apply. Also, AG \u00b6 17(d) \nmay apply if \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate \nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d Applicant has steadfastly adhered to \nhis brief explanation for his comments in the SF 86. None of the potentially mitigating \nconditions apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have evaluated the various aspects of \n                                                                                                                                                                             \n \n\n \n16 \n                                      \n \nthis ca\nApplicant sought help from his mortgage lenders, advising \nthem of the situation, but they would not offer him any assistance.

In \nJanuary 2003, he decided to start building wealth and accumulate investment \nproperties. His credit was excellent, and banks and mortgage lenders kept soliciting him \nto finance new properties or refinance existing ones. He accumulated investment \nproperties and was very successful in purchasing them at reasonable prices, \nrehabilitating them, and renting them. Unfortunately, because of the unexpected \ndownturn in the economy and the housing market crash, he lost renters when they lost \ntheir jobs and were unable to pay the monthly rent.

All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to \nresolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan.\u201d The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of \nan applicant\u2019s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the \nextent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding \nindebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is \nno requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts \nsimultaneously.

For all of these reasons, I \nng from his personal \nonduct. \nFormal Findings \nrth in the SOR, \n \nParagr\n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere are some questionable actions by Applicant in handling his delinquent \naccounts. At some point in September 2007, Applicant decided to stop using personal \nfunds and credit cards to pay his investment property taxes, mortgages, and other \nexpenses. He was capable of meeting his personal and family financial obligations, but \ncould no longer satisfy his investment obligations. As a result, several accounts fell into \narrears and became delinquent. Accounts were c\nwere in Applicant\u2019s name and not in the name of a separate corporate entity. \nAlso, as of April 2011, Applicant had $76,241.93 in his company 401(k), $29,208.97 in \nsavings, as well as $11,745.41 in other investments, not including his investment \nproperties.  Nevertheless, as it pertains to Applicant\u2019s financial matters, I conclude that \nApplicant has established a meaningful track record. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is also substantial, \nbut it is primarily related to Applicant\u2019s personal conduct in completing his SF 86. As to \nthe question pertaining to 180 day delinquencies, Applicant failed to answ\nonable and leads me to conclude that he deliberately falsified his response. It is \nundeniable that Applicant experienced severe financial problems as a result of the \ndevastated economy and the housing market crash. His efforts in that regard were \nnotable. However, his lack of candor in explaining his fiscal problems \u2013 essentially a \ncover up \u2013\n \nce leaves me wi\nA\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations, but has failed to mitigate the security concerns arisi\nc\n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set fo\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \naph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n18 \n                                      \n \n \n \n 1.l:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \n \nicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the ci\nrecord in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the n\nant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 9, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On June 11, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge gave adequate weight to\nhis evidence of mitigation.  Applicant also requests that the Board grant him a three-month\n\nprobationary security clearance, during which time he could prove his financial responsibility.\nFinding no error, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact: Applicant is 27 years old and has one\nchild for whom he voluntarily pays child support when he can afford to do so.  Applicant has a job\noffer as a research analyst, but must have a security clearance in order to begin working.  Applicant\nhas been unemployed since September 2009, when he was laid off from a job with an electronics\ncompany.  At present, Applicant\u2019s only income is from unemployment compensation, which\namounts to only $900 to $1,000 per month.  Applicant has a history of financial problems.  Applicant\ntraces his financial difficulties to an on-the-job back injury which prevented him from working from\nDecember 2005 until April 2006.  The workers\u2019 compensation Applicant received at that time did\nnot cover his expenses.  Applicant used credit cards to pay his living expenses and fell behind on his\nbills.   The SOR alleges 13 debts, six of which are student loans.  As of November 2009, the student\nloans totaled about $55,695.  Applicant provided documentation to show that he has made two $10\npayments on each of four of the debts, payments totaling $45 on another, and payments totaling\nabout $374 toward the student loans. \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not give adequate weight to his evidence of mitigation.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable\nsecurity clearance determination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole\nand decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a\nmanner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-23384 at 3\n(App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2007).  \nA review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against his financial history and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating\nconditions and factors.  Decision at 6-8.  Citing Applicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties, the large\namount of his debt, and his lack of a track record in making payments, the Judge reasonably\nexplained why the evidence Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  Id.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The mitigating\nevidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4,  2007).\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant included a request that the Board grant him a probationary\nclearance for a period of at least three months to allow him to prove his financial responsibility.  The\nBoard has no authority to grant such a request.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-22986 at 2 (App. Bd.\nNov. 26, 2008).\nThe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his\ndecision,  \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs.

The record evidence\nshows Applicant has a history of financial problems, to include defaulted student loans\nthat are now in collection. There is insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the security concerns stemming from his history of financial problems.\nAccordingly, as explained in further detail below, this case is decided against Applicant.\nJune 11, 2010\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case.  The AG\nwere published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace\nthe guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.   \n Exhibits K\u2013X. \n2\n Tr. 83. \n3\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on October 9,\n1\n2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of\nreasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a\ncomplaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guideline\nknown as Guideline F for financial considerations. The SOR also recommended that the\ncase be submitted to an administrative judge to decide whether to deny or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me November 24, 2009. The hearing took place February 3,\n2010. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received February 12, 2010. \nThe record was kept open until March 1, 2010, to allow Applicant to submit\nadditional documentary evidence. He did so in a timely manner, and those matters are\nadmitted without objections.   \n2\nFindings of Fact\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 27-year-old college graduate who is seeking an industrial security\nclearance for the first time. He is doing so in light of a job offer as a university research\nanalyst; the job offer is contingent upon him obtaining a security clearance. Applicant is\ncurrently unemployed and has been so since September 2009, when he was laid off\nfrom his job with an electronics company. He receives about $900 to $1,000 monthly in\nunemployment compensation, and he is currently in a negative cash flow situation.  He\n3\nis unmarried and the father of one child for whom he voluntarily pays child support when\nhe can afford to do so.\n\n Exhibits 1\u20135. \n4\n Exhibits T\u2013X. \n5\n Tr. 70. \n6\n Exhibit R. \n7\n Exhibit O. \n8\n Exhibit A. \n9\n Exhibits I and P. \n10\n Exhibit B. \n11\n Exhibits G and S. \n12\n3\nApplicant has a history of financial problems.  He traces his financial problems to\n4\nthe 2005\u20132006 period when he injured his back while at work.  As a result, he was\n5\nunable to work from about December 2005 to April 2006.  He had a temporary total\n6\ndisability and received $84 every two weeks in workers\u2019 compensation. He used credit\ncards to pay for his living expenses and fell behind on his bills. \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent or past-due debts with various creditors. In his\nanswer to the SOR, Applicant admits the debts, but contends that the accounts in SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.m are the same. In general, he explained that he was unemployed\nand unable to make steady payments, but would do so if he had the means. The debts\ninclude six student loans alleged to be past due for various amounts. The student loans\nwill be discussed together, and the current status of the other debts is discussed below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a concerns a collection account with a balance of $8,049. Applicant\nreceived a settlement offer in August 2008, but could not afford to accept it.  He has\n7\nsince made two $10 payments. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b concerns a collection account with a balance of $787. Applicant\nreceived a settlement officer in January 2008, but could not afford to accept it.  He has\n8\nsince made two $10 payments. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c concerns a medical collection account with a balance of $248.\nApplicant reduced the balance to $238 as of October 2009.  He has since made two\n9\n$10 payments.10\nSOR \u00b6 1.d concerns a judgment against Applicant in the amount of $5,196. It\nconcerns the same creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but appears to concern a different account. In\nJune 2009, the balance due was $5,174, and Applicant agreed to satisfy the account by\npaying $25 monthly.  Since then, he made a $25 payment in July 2009, and two $10\n11\npayments in February 2010.12\n\n Exhibits C and Q. \n13\n Tr. 77\u201379; Exhibits D, E, H, K, and M. \n14\n Exhibit M. \n15\n Exhibit E. \n16\n Exhibit D. \n17\n Exhibit H. \n18\n Exhibit K. \n19\n Exhibit L. \n20\n Exhibits F and N. \n21\n4\nSOR \u00b6 1.e concerns a collection account with a balance of $3,522. Applicant\npresented account statements showing a balance of $3,645 as of November 2009, and\na balance of $3,712 as of February 2010.  \n13\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f\u20131.k concern the six student loan accounts, all of which have past-due\nbalances. Applicant presented incomplete information on these loans, but it appears\nthat these loans are now in default and in collection.  Previously, SallieMae agreed to\n14\nput the loans in forbearance from late December 2007 to late July 2008.  Then in July\n15\n2009, Applicant applied for an economic hardship deferment and obtained preapproval\nof his request.  By November 2009, the loans had been turned over to a collection\n16\nagency seeking a lump-sum payment of 50% of the total principal and interest, which\nthen was about $55,695.  Applicant was only able to make small payments on the\n17\nloans, such as a $10 payment in November 2009.  More recently in February 2010, the\n18\nloans were returned from the collection agency to SallieMae, and Applicant made a $10\npayment the same month.  In addition to that payment, the last five payments to his\n19\naccount cover the period March 2008 to December 2009, for a total of about $374.  \n20\nSOR \u00b6 1.l concerns a charged-off account with a balance of $4,281. Applicant\npresented no documentary information on this account. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m concerns a collection account with a balance of $6,196. Applicant\npresented proof of a $10 payment in February 2009, and a $10 payment in September\n2009.21\n \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to\n22\na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n23\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n24\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n25\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n26\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n27\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n28\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n29\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n30\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n31\n5\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n22\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n23\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n24\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n25\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting\n26\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n27\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n28\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n29\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.30\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.31\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines set forth the relevant standards to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n32\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n33\n AG \u00b6 18.  \n34\n AG \u00b6 19(a).  \n35\n AG \u00b6 19(c). \n36\n6\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the Government. The Government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n32\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n33\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security\nconcern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under\nGuideline F is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n34\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \nThe record here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial\nproblems or difficulties. This history raises concerns because it indicates inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within\n35\n36\nthe meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish these two disqualifying\nconditions.   \n\n AG \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f) (setting forth six mitigating conditions). \n37\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n38\n7\nUnder Guideline F, there are six conditions that may mitigate security concerns:37\n(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\n(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) The affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\nThe most pertinent here are subparagraphs (b) and (d) based on Applicant\u2019s\nperiods of unemployment and his efforts to pay, although minimal, within his means. But\nthe credit in mitigation is insufficient to overcome the security concerns. Applicant is\nfacing a mountain of debt, to include defaulted student loans that are now in collection.\nHis prospects for making a realistic good-faith effort to repay or otherwise resolve his\nindebtedness are not good. Looking forward, it is too soon to rule out the likelihood of\nadditional financial problems. What is missing here is a well-established track record of\nrepayment. Although I am persuaded Applicant is sincere and genuinely wants to take\ncare of his delinquent debts, his track record at this point is insufficient to make any safe\npredictive judgments about the future.   \nTo conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s ongoing\nfinancial problems justify current doubts about his judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. Following Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, these doubts are\nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due\nconsideration to the whole-person concept  and Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence.\n38\n\n8\nNevertheless, Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\nfavorable clearance decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.        \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn December 4, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG).  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 26, 2010, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge \non March 12, 2010, and reassigned to me on March 23, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on March 18, 2010, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on April 26, \nJuly 12, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n2010. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5. GE 1 and 2 were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant objected to the three credit reports offered as GE 3 to 5 on \nthe basis that the reports were out of date. The objection was overruled, and GE 3 to 5 \nwere admitted. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough F, which were admitted without objection. The record was held open for \nApplicant to submit additional information. Applicant submitted documents, which were \nmarked AE G through R and admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s \nmemorandum is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on May 3, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is applying for a \nsecurity clearance. He is a law school graduate with a Juris Doctor degree. He married \nin 1997 and separated in 2002. His wife passed away in December 2007. He has a \nnine-year-old child.1 \n \n \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts as listed on credit reports obtained in \n2008 and 2009. Four of the debts were medical accounts in the amounts of $658, $410, \n$1,978, and $605. There were two student loan accounts in default for $71,000 and \n$53,000. There was an unpaid judgment of $3,831 for a student loan. Finally, the SOR \nalleged Applicant owed $47,000 for unpaid child support.2 \n \n \nApplicant graduated college in 1994 and law school in 1997. He funded his \neducation with student loans. He has not passed any state bar and is not a practicing \nattorney. He had periods of unemployment and underemployment. Applicant defaulted \non the student loans. He testified that he started rehabilitating his loans in 2008. He \nentered into a loan rehabilitation program with the U.S. Department of Education in May \n2009. The program consolidated eight loans, including those alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and \n1.c. The balance of those eight student loans at that time was $168,982. The \nrehabilitation program called for him to make at least nine monthly payments of $1,070 \nto bring the loans out of default.3  \n \n \nThe Department of Education notified Applicant in December 2009 that he had \nrehabilitated his defaulted student loans. He submitted a statement from December 27, \n2009, which showed the balance of six student loans at $10,177. These loans appear to \nbe the six loans that were included in his rehabilitation program along with the loans \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 28-29, 39, 46-47, 110; GE 1, 2. \n \n2 GE 3-5. \n \n3 Tr. at 23-27, 38-39, 69-78, 82-89; GE 1, 2; AE H, K, L, P. Any debts that were not specifically \nalleged in the SOR will not be used for disqualification purposes. They will be used in assessing \nApplicant\u2019s overall financial situation, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in analyzing the \n\u201cwhole person.\u201d \n \n\n \n3 \n \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. The repayment obligation called for Applicant to pay \nthose loans by 115 monthly payments of $117, starting in January 2010.4  \n \n \nApplicant submitted another statement dated December 27, 2009. This \nstatement notified Applicant that the \u201cforbearance (temporary suspension or extension \nof payment)\u201d on his loan(s) expired on December 21, 2009. The balance was $114,521. \nThe document called for Applicant to pay that amount though 147 monthly payments of \n$1,070, starting in January 2010. It is not completely clear if this refers to one or both of \nthe student loans alleged in the SOR, or is another student loan.5 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a third statement dated January 10, 2010, stating that he \nwas approved for an Income Contingent Repayment (ICR) plan in which he would only \npay the interest that accrues on his loan each month. The first interest payment of $405 \nwas due in January 2010. The document does not specify what student loans it \nincludes. Applicant testified that he believed the interest rate on his loans was 8%. That \nis the interest rate for the six student loans that add up to $10,177. The interest rate for \nthe two student loans alleged in the SOR is not included in any of the documents. \nApplicant testified he requested the ICR because his payments of $1,070 caused a real \n\u201chit\u201d to his savings, and he wanted to have some security for his child. He stated that the \nmonthly payments will increase as his income and ability to pay the loans increase.6 \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he had not paid the $3,831 judgment for a student loan. \nHe stated he spoke with the plaintiff\u2019s attorney the week before the hearing. The \nattorney told him the balance due on the judgment was about $8,000. Applicant made \nan offer of $5,000 to settle the judgment. The attorney indicated he would forward the \noffer to his client. Applicant had not heard back from the attorney as of the date of the \nhearing. No additional information on the judgment was submitted post-hearing.7 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was sick for a number of years before she passed away. She \nhad a growth on her brain similar to a tumor. She had numerous surgeries. It eventually \nstarted affecting her cognitive functions.8  \n \n \nApplicant petitioned for divorce in state A where he was living. His wife was living \nin state B at the time. His wife obtained a judgment in state A against him in August \n2005, requiring him to pay $655 per month in child support. The child support order was \nretroactive to January 2003. Applicant stated that he was paying child support before \nthe court order, but his wife made false statements to the court in order to obtain the \ncourt-ordered arrearages. He stated the court ordered him to pay arrearages of about \n$25,000. The court ordered all payments to be sent to state A. State A would forward \n                                                          \n4 AE B, J, L. \n \n5 AE I. \n \n6 Tr. at 23-27; AE J, O. \n \n7 Tr. at 37-38, 89-91; GE 2; AE E. \n \n8 Tr. at 31, 34-35, 58; GE 2. \n\n \n4 \n \nthe payments to state B, where his wife was living, for disbursement to her. Applicant \ntestified that he made the required child support payments through garnishment of his \nwages for about a year until he changed jobs. He stated that he paid state A for several \nmonths, and then his wife requested that he pay her directly. At that time, he did not live \nfar away from his wife. She told him there was a time lag from him sending the money \nto state A, which sent it to state B, before it was forwarded to her. Applicant stated he \nfelt sorry for his wife because of her medical condition. He stated that it was obvious \nthat she was dying and he felt that he could not deny her request under those \ncircumstances. He stated that he had no proof that he paid her because he paid her in \ncash.9 \n \n \nApplicant received custody of his child upon the death of his wife. Any child \nsupport arrearages he paid would likely be forwarded to the custodian of his child, which \nis Applicant. He stated that he contacted state A and was told that he was \u201cnot in \narrearage to [state A],\u201d and the balance on his account was zero. Applicant submitted \nan Equifax credit report obtained on March 17, 2010. That credit report continues to list \nthe child support debt, and it has grown to $51,436. The address of the child support \nagency listing the debt is not in state A. The address is in state B, where Applicant\u2019s \nwife lived until she passed away. State A has no open case against Applicant for unpaid \nchild support. Applicant did not submit any evidence as to the status of the account in \nstate B.10 \n \n \nApplicant submitted documented proof that he paid the $658 medical debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a on April 22, 2010. He also paid another $402 medical debt on the \nsame day.11 \n \n \nApplicant disputed owing the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h. \nThe debts are listed on the Equifax credit report obtained on January 13, 2009. They \nare not listed on the Equifax credit reports obtained on October 2, 2009 and March 17, \n2010.12  \n \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. He stated his current financial \nsituation is stable. He has an annual base salary of $70,000, with an annual bonus of up \nto $5,000. His child receives annual Social Security death benefits of about $20,000.13 \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n9 Tr. at 27-37, 47-69; GE 2; AE R. \n \n10 Tr. at 27-37, 47-69; GE 2; AE C, D, F. \n \n11 Tr. at 22-23; AE A. \n \n12 Tr. at 39-43; GE 4, 5; AE F. \n \n13 Tr. at 44-46, 78-79, 93, 106; GE 2. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling to pay his \nobligations for a period. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges that \u201c[Applicant\u2019s] personal financial statement has a negative \nnet remainder.\u201d The evidence did not support that allegation. SOR \u00b6 1.i is concluded for \nApplicant.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant still owes more than $170,000 in student loans and a judgment. He has \nnot established that his child support arrearages have been resolved. His financial \nissues are current and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties were partly caused by his periods of \nunemployment and underemployment. These qualify as conditions that were outside \nher control. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Applicant rehabilitated his student loans, but the \namount he still owes is so large that he is only paying interest on the loan. The principal \nwill remain, or more likely, continue to grow. He has unresolved child support issues. He \ndid not submit sufficient information for a finding that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable. \n \nApplicant paid two medical debts. One of the debts was not alleged in the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. When considering the total \namount owed on his student loans, his payments to date are insufficient to support a \nfinding that he has made a good-faith effort to pay or otherwise resolve those debts. AG \n\u00b6 20(d) is not applicable to his remaining debts. Applicant has not received financial \ncounseling, and he has not established clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant disputed owing the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h. \nThe debts have been deleted from his credit report. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to those \ndebts. \n \n \nApplicant was in arrears for more than $40,000 in child support when his wife \npassed away in 2007. He testified that state A is no longer looking to him for the \narrearages because he has custody of his child. The child support debt continues to be \nlisted by state B on his credit report with a higher balance. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable \nto that debt. The Appeal Board has stated that \u201ceven if a delinquent debt is legally \nunenforceable under state law, the federal government is entitled to consider the facts \nand circumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy \nthe debt in a timely manner.\u201d14 Even if states A and B are no longer enforcing this debt, \nit continues to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \n \n \n                                                          \n14 ISCR Case No. 07-09966 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008). \n\n \n8 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant funded his education using student loans. He graduated law school, \nbut has not passed a bar. He was left with a substantial amount of student loans without \nthe income to pay them. He is now gainfully employed and has rehabilitated his student \nloans, but he is currently only paying interest on the loans. He stated that his wife lied to \nthe court in order to obtain about $25,000 in arrearages on child support. His wages \nwere garnished for a period, and then he was required to pay through the state. He \ntestified that despite her previous actions, he agreed to pay her child support in cash \nrather than go through the state. At best, Applicant\u2019s actions were foolish. I have \nsignificant unresolved concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances and judgment.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.i: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The record shows Applicant has a\nhistory of financial problems or difficulties as evidenced by more than two dozen\ndelinquent accounts for about $24,789. Although her current financial situation is\nimproved, the record contains insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nsecurity concerns stemming from her problematic credit history. Accordingly, as\nexplained below, this case is decided against Applicant.\nJanuary 15, 2010\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines), which were made effective within the Defense Department on September\n1, 2006, apply to this case. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.\n Exhibit 1. \n2\n Tr. 8. \n3\n Tr. 58. \n4\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant on June 4, 2009. The SOR is similar to a complaint, and it detailed the factual\nbasis for the action under Guideline F for financial considerations. Also, the SOR\nrecommended submitting the case to an administrative judge for a determination\nwhether to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on August 5, 2009. The hearing took place September 21,\n2009. The transcript (Tr.) was received September 29, 2009.  \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 37-year-old software engineer who is employed by a federal\ncontractor. She began her current employment in July 2008, and she completed a\nsecurity clearance application in August 2008.  This is her initial application for a\n2\nsecurity clearance to work in the defense industry.  \n3\nApplicant\u2019s educational background includes a bachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics\nin 1999, a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science in 2001, a master\u2019s degree in\nsecondary education in 2004, and she has earned credits toward a master\u2019s degree in\nmathematics. She financed her education largely through student loans. She owes a\ntotal of about $188,000, and the loans are now in deferment until April 2010.  She\n4\nexpects to receive another deferment based on her level of income. \nHer first marriage ended in divorce in 2001. She remarried in 2003, and she has\na five-year-old son from this marriage. She separated from her husband in January\n2009, she filed for divorce in July 2009, and she expected the divorce to become final in\nOctober 2009. \n\n Exhibit 1. \n5\n Tr. 36\u201337. \n6\n Tr. 37. \n7\n Tr. 38. \n8\n Tr. 95. \n9\n Tr. 39. \n10\n Tr. 65\u201367. \n11\n3\nHer employment history shows she has been continuously employed, except for\na three-month period in 2002, since 1998.  She worked as a tutor/executive assistant\n5\nfrom October 1998 to December 2001; she was unemployed from January 2002 to\nMarch 2002; she worked as a data entry clerk from March 2002 to August 2002; and\nshe worked as a teacher for public schools from August 2002 to July 2008, when she\nbegan her current job. Her annual gross income as a teacher ranged from $38,000 to\n$48,000. She now earns about $61,000 annually as an entry-level software engineer.\nShe also has a part-time job teaching on Saturdays to earn extra money and pursue her\nlove of teaching. \nApplicant does not dispute that she has a history of financial problems, which she\ntraces back to the 2004 period.  She was then pregnant with her son and her health\n6\ninsurance changed from full coverage for the pregnancy to 80% coverage. An\nunplanned C-section during child birth caused a longer period of maternity leave, which\nresulted in a six-week period of unpaid leave. These circumstances were the start of her\nfinancial problems. \nHer husband lost his job about two weeks after their child\u2019s birth in 2004.  Her\n7\nhusband has three other children (two from a prior marriage and one from a prior\nrelationship), and he fell behind on his child-support payments. By about January 2005,\nhe was jailed for nonsupport, and Applicant incurred expenses to obtain his release and\nfor legal fees. She also started paying the child-support payments (about $200\nmonthly). According to Applicant, her husband did not work during most of their\nmarriage.  Also according to Applicant, her husband did not finish high school, he is\n8\nbipolar and has epilepsy, and he does little to help himself. Now separated, her\nhusband lives in a shed behind his mother\u2019s house; he is unemployed, but he is taking\nhis medications.  Applicant found that her teacher\u2019s salary, after deductions (including a\n9\nsizeable payment for health insurance) was not enough to meet expenses. \nApplicant has made some progress on her indebtedness since beginning her\ncurrent job in 2008.  In February 2009, she withdrew the entire proceeds (about\n10\n$12,000 after taxes) from a teachers retirement system account and used that money to\npay and settle debts.  She has about $70 in cash in bank accounts, and she agrees\n11\n\n Tr. 96. \n12\n Tr. 55\u201356. \n13\n4\nthat she is living paycheck to paycheck.  According to Applicant, she is in the process\n12\nof attempting to buy a home near her place of work.  She entered into a contract to\n13\npurchase a home for $122,000, and she was waiting on financing and for her divorce to\nbecome final. She is making the purchase through a governmental program that allows\n100% financing.    \nThe SOR alleged 26 delinquent debts in various amounts for a total of\napproximately $24,789. In her reply to the SOR, Applicant admits all the debts except\nfor the debt alleged in \u00b6 1.o, and she also provided explanations about the various\ndebts. The current status of the debts, as best as can be determined, is described in the\nfollowing table.\nDebts\nStatus\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b\u2013two medical\naccounts in collection with the same\ncreditor for $42 and $156.\nAdmits the debts existed, but they were\ndeleted from her credit report (Tr. 79\u201382,\nExhibit 2 at pages 79\u201380).   \nSOR \u00b6 1.c\u2013$168 medical account in\ncollection.\nUnpaid (Tr. 82). \nSOR \u00b6 1.d\u2013$1,103 collection account.  \nSettled for $350 in Sep. 2009 (Tr. 82\u201383,\nExhibit B).  \nSOR \u00b6 1.e\u2013$117 collection account.\nUnpaid (Tr. 83).  \nSOR \u00b6 1.f\u2013$1,787 collection account.\nSettled for $1,072 in Sep. 2009 (Tr.\n83\u201384, Exhibit C). \nSOR \u00b6 1.g\u2013$2,824 collection account. \nIntends to settle (Tr. 84\u201385).\nSOR \u00b6 1.h\u2013$374 collection account.  \nPaid in full (Tr. 85, Exhibit D).\nSOR \u00b6 1.i\u2013$146 collection account. \nPaid in full (Tr. 85, Exhibit E).\nSOR \u00b6 1.j\u2013$6,350 collection account. \nUnresolved, but making $100 monthly\npayments since about Mar. 2009;\nbalance is about $6350 as of Apr. 2009\n(Tr. 85\u201387, Exhibit 2 at pages 112\u2013113).\nSOR \u00b6 1.k\u2013$80 collection account. \nUnpaid (Tr. 87). \nSOR \u00b6 1.l\u2013$717 collection account. \nUnpaid and disputes amount paid; no\ndocumentation of dispute (Tr. 87\u201388).\nSOR \u00b6 1.m\u2013$359 collection account. \nUnpaid (Tr. 88).\n\n Exhibits H and I. \n14\n Exhibit 2 at pages 81, 83, and 84 (the NSF checks were not alleged, but were considered under the whole-\n15\nperson concept). \n5\nSOR \u00b6 1.n\u2013$99 collection account. \nPaid in full (Tr. 88, Exhibit F).\nSOR \u00b6 1.o\u2013$4,765 unpaid judgment. \nUnresolved; denies because she believes\nshe paid account off via a settlement; no\ndocumentation of dispute (Tr. 75\u201379).\nSOR \u00b6 1.p\u2013$1,294 collection account. \nUnpaid (Tr. 88).\nSOR \u00b6 1.q\u2013$85 collection account. \nUnpaid, but deleted from credit report (Tr.\n88, Exhibit 3 at page 3 of 30).\nSOR \u00b6 1.r\u2013$119 collection account. \nUnpaid (Tr. 88).\nSOR \u00b6 1.s\u2013$430 collection account. \nSettled three accounts for $190 each with\nsame agent collecting for same creditor\n(Tr. 88-89, Exhibit G). \nSOR \u00b6 1.t\u2013$194 collection account. \nUnpaid (Tr. 89).\nSOR \u00b6 1.u\u2013$158 collection account. \nUnpaid (Tr. 89).\nSOR \u00b6 1.v\u2013$741 collection account. \nUnpaid (Tr. 89).\nSOR \u00b6 1.w\u2013$93 collection account. \nUnpaid, but disputing amount owed due\nto a broken apartment lease; no\ndocumentation provided. \nSOR \u00b6 1.x\u2013$141 collection account. \nUnpaid (Tr. 90).\nSOR \u00b6 1.y\u2013$590 collection account. \nUnpaid, but received offer to settle at an\n85% discount (Tr. 90, Exhibit 2 at page\n85).\nSOR \u00b6 1.z\u2013$1,018 medical account in\ncollection. \nUnpaid, but discussing payment with\ncreditor (Tr. 90). \nIn summary, Applicant resolved six accounts by payment in full or settlement for a total\nof $2,611, one account is in a repayment plan, and the other accounts are unresolved. \nIn addition to the debts in the SOR, she presented proof that she paid off two\nmedical accounts for a total of about $52.  Likewise, her financial history includes\n14\nissuing NSF checks, which were not alleged in the SOR as they were satisfied.

She denies gambling, as her preference is to enjoy the dining opportunities at\nthe casino.  \n16\nIn about April 2009, Applicant obtained the services of a credit repair company.17\nShe did so in an effort to improve her credit history so she could qualify to purchase a\nhome. As a result, some debts, which she admits are otherwise valid, were deleted from\nher credit reports. She did not receive financial counseling from this company, and she\nis no longer using their services. \nApplicant had about $70 in cash accounts at the time of the hearing.  She\n18\nagrees that she is living paycheck to paycheck, but she is now able to pay her bills on\ntime.  Her most recent three-in-one credit report, dated September 2009, shows credit\n19\nscores of 563, 542, and 660, which are described as poor, very poor, and fair.  \n20\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n21\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n22\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n23\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n24\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n25\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n26\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n27\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n28\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n29\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n30\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n31\n7\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n24\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n25\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n26\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n27\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n28\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.29\nThe Agency\u2019s appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.30\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n31\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n32\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 18.  \n33\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(a).  \n34\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(c). \n35\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f) (setting forth six mitigating conditions). \n36\n8\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n32\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security\nconcern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under\nGuideline F is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n33\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \nThe record supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial\ndifficulties. This history raises concerns because it indicates inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of\n34\n35\nGuideline F. The facts are more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying\nconditions, and they suggest financial irresponsibility as well.\nUnder \u00b6 20 of Guideline F, there are six conditions that may mitigate security\nconcerns.  Of the six conditions, the record shows that three apply in Applicant\u2019s favor\n36\nas follows: \n(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n37\n9\n(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions taken to resolve the issue. \nAlthough Applicant deserves credit for her efforts, the credit in mitigation is\ninsufficient to overcome the security concerns raised by her problematic credit history. It\nis apparent that Applicant\u2019s credit history suffered during her second marriage to a\nman\u2014with limited education and medical issues\u2014who was unable or unwilling to fulfill\nhis obligation to support his family. Still, Applicant was employed full-time during the\nmarriage, and she has the education and skills to manage her personal finances even\non a teacher\u2019s income. She made some progress in resolving her indebtedness during\n2008\u20132009, when she began her current job at a higher salary and withdrew about\n$12,000 from a teachers retirement account. But as revealed in the findings, only about\n$3,000 was accounted for in debt payments. What happened to the other $9,000 was\nnot accounted for at the hearing, and it militates against a favorable decision. \nLooking forward, based on Applicant\u2019s problematic credit history (which is\nongoing), her uneven efforts to address it, her limited means ($70 in cash accounts),\nand a huge student loan obligation to honor (now deferred), it is too soon to rule out the\nlikelihood of additional financial problems. What is missing here is a realistic plan to\nresolve the vast majority of the delinquent debts. Without such a plan, along with a well-\nestablished track record of adhering to the plan, the credit in mitigation is insufficient to\novercome the security concerns.  \nTo conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s history of\nfinancial difficulties create current doubts about her judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. She did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the security concerns. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due consideration to\nthe nine-factor whole-person concept  and Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence. Applicant\n37\ndid not meet her ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\nThis case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations, as required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of\nEnclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.z: \nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.        \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nSeptember 29, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn March 24, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F  for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn April 3, 2009, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this Administrative\nJudge on May 1, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 15, 2009, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on July 23, 2009, in Honolulu, Hawaii.  The\nGovernment offered Exhibits 1 through 7, which were received without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through L, which were\nalso admitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open\nuntil August 7, 2009, to submit additional documents. He timely submitted seven\n\n2\nadditional documents, which have been entered into evidence without objection as\nExhibits M through S. At the further request of Applicant, the record remained open until\nSeptember 7, 2009, to submit additional documents. He timely submitted two additional\ndocuments, which have been entered into evidence without objection as Exhibits T and\nU. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on August 7, 2009. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 37 years old. He is married, and he has no children. Applicant was\nemployed by a defense contractor, but was terminated on June 5, 2009, because he did\nnot have a security clearance. He is seeking a DoD security clearance in connection\nwith future employment in the defense sector.\nThe SOR lists five allegations (1.a. through 1.e.) regarding financial difficulties\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F, for overdue debts. The debts will be discussed in the\nsame order as they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $19,874.\nApplicant testified that this debt has not been paid. The actual debt is $8,183, and the\nremainder is penalties and late payments (Tr at 59) (Exhibit 4). \nIn order to help him resolve his overdue debt, Applicant engaged the services of\na credit counseling company (CCC) in January 2008. Applicant averred that he\nattempted to resolve his financial difficulties eight months before he even applied for a\nsecurity clearance (Tr at 50).  Exhibit K shows Applicant\u2019s first payment of $556.75 to\nthe CCC on February 27, 2008. He had made arrangements to pay the CCC that\namount every month, and he only missed one monthly payment, which he had arranged\nwith the CCC (Exhibit B) His last payment was on April 28, 2009, and he had paid them\napproximately $3,000.  The plan was that approximately half of his payments would\neventually go to pay his creditors and the other half was paid as fees to the CCC (Tr at\n33-35). He was forced to stop making payments to the CCC because of his loss of\nemployment. \nAfter Applicant lost his employment, he employed the services of an attorney on\nMay 31, 2009, to file for bankruptcy (Exhibit K), which consisted of a meeting with the\nattorney and paying him $400 each visit for a total of $1,600. A Notice of Bankruptcy\nsubmitted after the hearing (Exhibit U) establishes that a Chapter 13 bankruptcy was\nfiled on Applicant\u2019s behalf on August 24, 2009, and a creditor\u2019s meeting was scheduled\nto be heard on September 24, 2009. This debt is scheduled to be resolved in\nbankruptcy. \n\n3\n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $14,251.\nApplicant testified that this debt has not been paid. The actual debt is $6,915, and the\nremainder is penalties and late payments (Tr at 57) (Exhibit 4). This debt was also\noriginally to be satisfied by the CCC and it is now scheduled to be resolved in\nbankruptcy. \n1.c. This  overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,196.\nApplicant testified that he was informed by his CCC that this debt has been settled for\n$598 through his CCC (Tr at 37-38). Exhibit 2, a letter from the representative of the\nCCC, dated March 31, 2009, indicates that this debt has settled. I find that this debt has\nbeen resolved. \n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,017.\nApplicant testified that he was informed by his CCC that this debt was also settled for\n$598 through his CCC. There has been some confusion about the status of this debt,\nbecause Applicant has not received a letter from this creditor showing that this debt was\nresolved. However, based upon the representation he received from the CCC,  I find\nthat this debt has been resolved (Exhibit 2) \n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $8,069.\nApplicant testified that this debt has not been paid. The actual debt is $2,319, and the\nremainder is penalties and late payments (Tr at 59). This debt was also originally to be\nsatisfied by the CCC and it is now scheduled to be resolved in  bankruptcy. \n \nIn addition to the debts listed on the SOR and discussed above, Applicant\ntestified that he owes $5,198 for Federal taxes and $1,638 for state tax. He is paying\n$200 a month for the Federal tax and $126 a month for the state tax. This overdue tax\ndebt resulted in part because of his wife\u2019s second job and not declaring enough\ndeductions. They will continue paying this debt, which is expected to be included for\npayment as part of his Chapiter 13 bankruptcy (Tr at 92-93). \nApplicant testified that his financial difficulties occurred over time through bills for\ncar repairs, medical treatments, vehicle purchases, and he also borrowed money on his\ncredit card to attend law school for one semester. He was able to keep current on these\ndebts until he started to receive late salary payments from his employer in 2006. As a\nresult, he was forced to make late payments on his credit cards, and he received\nextremely severe penalties and interest charges, which greatly increased his debt. \nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant had no credit cards, and he is current on all\nof his other debts. Exhibit N includes a current Personal Financial Statement (PFS),\nwhich shows that Applicant has very little net reminder each month. However, at the\ntime he completed this form, he did not yet know what he was scheduled to receive in\nunemployment compensation, so that was not included in his PFS. Exhibit S is a copy\nof the Applicant\u2019s unemployment compensation check, which shows that he now\nreceives $978 net, for every two weeks. This certainly will improve his financial situation\nuntil he can obtain employment. \n\n4\nMitigation\nApplicant submitted two very positive character letters (Exhibits F and G). Exhibit\nF from his former security manager stated, \u201c[Applicant] has always acted in a\nprofessional manner and has consistently demonstrated loyalty and trustworthiness\nduring his employment.\u201d The letter from his former supervisor said, \u201c[Applicant] has\nalways displayed a high degree of integrity and responsibility . . . performed with the\nhighest degree of professionalism.\u201d (Exhibit G).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\n\n5\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n     Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nAG \u00b6 19 (a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and has been\nunable to pay many of his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to\nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns from financial\ndifficulties:\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 (b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d As noted above,\nApplicant argued that his financial problems were in large part the result of his receiving\nlate payments from his employer, which caused him to fall behind on his credit card\npayments.  Since he fell behind, he has acted quite responsibly to resolve all of these\noverdue debts.  First he engaged the services of a CCC and made payments of\n$556.75 per month to them for more than one year, only stopping after he was\nterminated from his employment, because he could not get a security clearance. He\nthereafter employed an attorney and has paid him $1,6000 to file for bankruptcy to\nresolve his debts. What I find most impressive is Applicant began this process with the\nCCC eight months before he even applied for a security clearance, which indicates that\nthe attempt to resolve his financial difficulties was not motivated by his desire for a\nsecurity clearance. Therefore, I find that this mitigating condition is a significant factor\n\n6\nfor consideration in this case. I also find MC 20 (d) is applicable since Applicant has\nbeen making a good-faith effort to resolve all of his overdue debts. Based on Applicant\u2019s\noverall conduct, I conclude that he has mitigated the financial concerns of the\nGovernment.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why the Mitigating Conditions apply along with the extremely positive letters\nwritten on Applicant\u2019s behalf, I find that the record evidence leaves me with no\nsignificant  questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant\nhas mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\n          Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n          Paragraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\n       In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 7, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline\nJ (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 27, 2010,\nafter the hearing, Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact were supported by substantial record evidence and whether the Judge\u2019s conclusion that\nApplicant had not met his burden of persuasion as to mitigation was erroneous.  Consistent with the\nfollowing discussion, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an engineer for a\nDefense contractor.  He received a Bachelor of Science degree from a noted U.S. university.  \nBetween 2004 and 2005, while in college, Applicant used marijuana on three different\noccasions.

However, he continued to carry a packet of\nthe drug in his backpack for an additional two years.  He provided no clear reasons why he did so\nfor such an extended period of time.  \nApplicant is indebted to a U.S. city for unpaid parking tickets totaling nearly $2,200.  He\nprovided no documentation or other evidence as to when he will be able to pay these fines.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in some of his findings of fact.  For example, he\nstates that he has never been on probation.  Rather, his court case involved a deferred entry of\njudgement.  Having examined the record, we conclude that Applicant is correct.  The essence of his\ndeferred adjudication is that he would satisfy certain requirements\u201312-step counseling, etc.\u2013and\nremain free of other criminal offenses for a period of 18 months, after which the case would be\ndismissed.  Applicant Brief at 1.  Although it appears to have certain features that are analogous to\nprobation, the record does not support the Judge\u2019s use of that term.\nHowever, the context in which the Judge addressed this issue was Applicant\u2019s having failed\nto provide documentation concerning the deferred adjudication, though he had been given an\n\n3\nopportunity to do so.  Tr. at 70.  There is no reason to believe that the Judge\u2019s error in terminology\naffected either his opinion of Applicant\u2019s failure to provide evidence or his ultimate resolution of\nthe case.  Therefore, the error is harmless.  See ISCR Case No. 08-07528 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29,\n2009).  Otherwise, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are based upon substantial\nrecord evidence or constitute reasonable characterizations of the record.  See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n(Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d)\n In support of his appeal, Applicant has submitted evidence outside the record pertaining to\nhis criminal case.  Applicant asserts that this document should have been submitted by a local court\nto the Judge and should be considered by the Board in that light.  Compare Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo\nnew evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal Board\u201d).  However, some of the\ndocuments were clearly produced outside of the pertinent time frame.  The remaining documents\nmerely confirm the Judge\u2019s findings that Applicant attends 12-step programs.  Therefore, even if the\ndocuments had made it to the Judge in a timely fashion they would not have altered the Judge\u2019s\nanalysis.  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made,\u2019\u201d both as to the mitigating conditions and the whole-person\nfactors.

A hearing was held on the scheduled date for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, or deny Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of three exhibits.  Applicant, in turn, relied on one witness\n(himself) and no exhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was received on November 9, 2009.\nJanuary 27, 2010\n\n2\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied. \nProcedural Issues and Rulings\nPrior to the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documented court records pertaining to the status of his drug possession\ncase, which is pending final disposition.  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted\nseven days to October 14, 2009, to provide supplemental documentation. Applicant did\nnot elect to supplement the record. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline H, Applicant is alleged to have (a) been arrested in March 2008\nfor possession of a controlled substance (psilocybin), a felony, and possession of\nmarijuana by driver; to which he pleaded guilty and received a deferred entry of\njudgment for count I (with count II dismissed) and was placed on three years probation\nand ordered to complete drug counseling, attend four 12-step meetings weekly, and pay\na fine; (b) used psilocybin on at least one occasion in approximately May 2005; (c)\npurchased psilocybin on at least one occasion in approximately 2005; and (d) used\nmarijuana at least three times from January 2004 to about August 2005. The same\nallegations were incorporated under Guideline J.\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to (a) to have falsified material facts in\nhis interrogatory answers, signed and notarized in April 2009, by answering no to a\nquestion inquiring about any prior purchases of illegal drugs and (b) be indebted to a\nlocal municipality for $2,200 in accumulated parking tickets.   \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to his drug-related allegations and\nhis accumulated parking tickets, but denied any intention to falsify his interrogatory\nanswers. In explanation, he claimed he did not fully understand the question and\ninterpreted it to be questioning him about any drug sale or distribution.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 25-year-old engineer for a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nincorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings\nfollow.\nBetween 2004 and 2005 (while in college), Applicant used marijuana on three\nseparate occasions after he had consumed excessive amounts of alcohol.   He did not\nfeel any affects from the marijuana he used (Tr. 53). He was valedictorian of his high\nschool class and matriculated to a respected university after high school (see ex. 1).  He\nwas awarded a bachelors of science degree in engineering in 2007 (ex. 1; Tr. 43).\nBesides his use of marijuana in college, Applicant tried psilocybin mushrooms on one\n\n1\n  Mushrooms are the street name for psilocybin or psilocin, which is a Schedule (Sch.) 1 Controlled Substance\nunder the Controlled Substances Act contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c).   See United States v. Hussein, 351\nF.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir. 2003) (mushrooms are a plant which may contain the Schedule 1(c)(15) and 1(c)16\ncontrolled substance psilocybin or psilocyn).  \n3\noccasion (see ex. 2; Tr.48).   He purchased the mushrooms from a woman he met in\n1\ncollege. They made the exchange in a local park and used the mushrooms together in\nthe park (Tr. 45-46).  Applicant was aware at the time that the drugs he purchased and\nused were illegal (Tr. 47-48).  \nIn March 2008, Applicant was arrested for (1) possession of psilocybin\nmushrooms and (2) possession of marijuana by driver. He pleaded guilty to the\npsilocybin possession charge in April 2008 and received a deferred entry of judgment\non the charge, subject to his being placed on three years probation and ordered to\ncomplete drug counseling, attend four 12-step meetings, and pay a fine. The court\ndismissed  the count I charge (see ex. 2).   \nWhether Applicant has completed the terms of his probation is unclear.  Afforded\nan opportunity to supplement the record with updated probation documentation, he\nfailed to do so. He assured he enrolled in an educational counseling program (including\ndrug urinalyses) and a narcotics anonymous (NA) program. His documented treatment\nstatus report credits him with successfully completing the program\u2019s requirements in\nAugust 2008 (see ex. 2; Tr. 26-27). His completed requirements included 24 education\nclasses and six outside NA meetings (ex. 2). Twice, he was tested for drugs while in the\nprogram, and the results were negative on each test (ex. 2). He indicated no awareness\nof awarded chips commemorating periods of assured abstinence, though, and provided\nno documentation of any awarded chips from his NA attendance (Tr. 34). \nSince completing his required drug counseling program, Applicant has continued\nto attend 12-step classes weekly: two with his NA chapter and two with his alcoholics\nanonymous (AA) chapter (see ex. 2; Tr. 26-29).  He does not have a sponsor, but he\nassures he will continue to attend these meetings in the future (Tr. ).  He insists he last\nused illegal drugs in August 2005 and expresses remorse for his past drug activity (Tr.\n32-33).  And he assures he has no intention of using illegal drugs in the future (see ex.\n2; Tr. 68-69). Applicant\u2019s assurances are credible, and are accepted.  Still, his court\nrecords indicate he was placed on three years of court-supervised probation, which still\nhas over a year to run (see ex. 2). Afforded additional time to provide clarifying\ndocumentation about his probation status, Applicant failed to take advantage of the\nopportunity.\nAfter using psilocybin mushrooms for the last time (May 2005), Applicant\ncontinued to carry a package of the drugs in his backpack for two additional years (Tr.\n48-49).  Applicant could not provide any clear reasons why he carried these drugs in his\nbackpack for such an extended period of time (Tr. 49).\n\n4\nAsked to respond to written interrogatories from DOHA, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d\nto questions inquiring about his purchase of psilocybin mushrooms in April 2009 (ex. 2).\nHe attributes his omission to a mistaken understanding about the meaning of the term\n\u201cpurchase\u201d (Tr. 57, 63-68).  Since he only intended to share the mushrooms with his\ngirlfriend, he did not think the question applied to him (Tr. 64). \nAfter admitting to his accumulated parking violations, Applicant has recently\ninquired of the court about them (Tr. 54-56).  He must resolve them before he can\nregister his vehicle, and he assures he will pay his outstanding tickets (Tr. 68).  He\nprovides no time lines for resolving his parking tickets, though, and no documentation of\nany efforts to date in addressing them.\nApplicant has not provided any documentation from the court regarding his\nMarch 2008 deferred adjudication status. He continues to be on probation, absent court-\napproved relaxation of probation terms. Nor has Applicant provided any documented\nchips commemorating any sustained periods of abstinence.  Whether he is entitled to\nany sobriety chips from NA or AA is unclear at this time.  \nApplicant did not provide any character references or evidence of performance\nevaluations from his employer.  At this point, it is not clear how Applicant is regarded by\nhis supervisors and coworkers and members of his community.  \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) list guidelines to be used by\nadministrative judges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases. These\nguidelines take into account factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for\nthe individual applicant, as well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. These guidelines\ninclude \"[c]onditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d\n(disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of the \"[c]onditions that could mitigate\nsecurity concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or\nnot a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not\nrequire administrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of\nthe guidelines is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with\nAG \u00b6 2(c).\nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be\nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \n\n5\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\n Drug Involvement\nThe Concern: Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  AG \u00b6 24.\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  AG \u00b6 30.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.  AG \u00b6 15.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons; and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\n\n6\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation of the Government's case.  Because Executive Order 10865 requires that all\nsecurity clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nAnalysis  \n  Over a two-year period (between 2004 and 2005), Applicant used marijuana and\npsilocybin mushrooms intermittently (at least on three occasions) in social situations with\nfriends and made at least one purchase of psilocybin in 2005 for sharing with his friends.\nMore recently (in March 2008), he was arrested for possession of psilocybin, and he\nsubsequently pleaded guilty to the charge.  The presiding court accepted his guilty plea\nand entered an order of deferred judgment, conditioned on Applicant\u2019s satisfying court-\nimposed conditions (completion of drug counseling, attendance of four 12-step meetings,\nand payment of a fine) during a three-year period of probation.  Whether Applicant has\nbeen credited by the court with satisfying all of its imposed conditions is unclear. \n Based on the developed record to date, Applicant remains on probation, and\nsecurity concerns over his past drug involvement persist under both Guidelines H and J.\nSecurity concerns are also raised initially under Guideline E over his omitting his\npsilocybin purchase from his responses to DOHA interrogatories and his prior\naccumulation of unpaid parking tickets. \n  Drug Involvement and criminal conduct concerns\n Applicant\u2019s past involvement with illegal drugs raises initial security concerns over\nrisks of recurrence, as well as  judgment issues. On the strength of the evidence\npresented, several disqualifying conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines for drug abuse\nare applicable: DC \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d and DC \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal possession,\nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or\npossession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d\nJudgment concerns exist over Applicant\u2019s past use of illegal drugs, his drug-\nrelated possession arrest and ensuing guilty plea and his still uncertain satisfaction of\ncourt-imposed probation conditions. Applicant\u2019s actions are expressly covered by\nGuidelines H and J. Besides the disqualifying conditions covered by the drug\ninvolvement guideline, Applicant\u2019s drug activities are covered by the criminal conduct\nguideline as well.  DC \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offense,\u2019\u201d and\nDC \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s\nsituation.\n\n7\nWhile Applicant has made some noticeable gains in avoiding illegal drugs this\npast year, his efforts are for the most part lacking in specificity and documentation.\nWhether he has complied with all of the court\u2019s probation conditions is unclear, and he\nremains on probation for the foreseeable future.  MC \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment,\u201d is disjunctive and can be partially applied to Applicant\u2019s situation.\nApplicant\u2019s stated  intent not to abuse drugs in the future has some application as well.\nAvailable considerations under \u00b6 26(b) include \u201c(3) an appropriate period of abstinence,\u201d\nand \u201c(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any\nviolation.\u201d  \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s lack of any endorsements from colleagues and friends\nfamiliar with his current lifestyle, current probation situation, and absence of any\ndocumented assurances he no longer is involved with illegal drugs, mitigation is difficult\nto establish. MC \u00b6 26(b)(1), \u201cdisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts,\u201d\nand MC \u00b6 26(b)(2), \u201cchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used,\u201d\nhave only limited application without supporting documentation.  In fairness to Applicant,\nhe exhibited candor at his hearing about his past drug use and purchase and his\nassociations with persons who have used the substance.\nAt the closing of the record, Applicant continues to be on probation from his 2008\nplea arrangement and has provided no documentation of his completion of any drug\neducation or treatment program. Too much is unknown about Applicant\u2019s abstention\nefforts to warrant safe predictions he will not resume his involvement with illegal\nsubstances in the foreseeable future.  So, while Applicant\u2019s assurances that he has no\nintention of ever resuming his use of marijuana, or any illegal substance, in the future,\nare entitled to some weight, they cannot be totally separated from the recurrence risks\nthat face Applicant for so long as he continues to be on probation without any\ndocumented dismissal of the deferred charges or evidence of his continuing participation\nin his NA/AA meetings. \nFrom a whole person perspective, Applicant has established some probative\nevidence of his overall honesty, trustworthiness, and understanding of DoD policy\nconstraints on the use of illegal substances. Still of some concern, though, are\nApplicant\u2019s recent drug possession plea and his current probation status.  Without any\nendorsements from persons familiar with his work and community activities, or continued\nparticipation in NA/AA meetings, he is not able to surmount justified concerns associated\nwith his past drug activities.  In Applicant\u2019s case, more documentation of his abstention\nefforts is required before he can be credited with mitigating security risks associated with\nhis past drug and criminal involvement.   \nConsidering the record as a whole, at this time there is too little seasoning of\nApplicant\u2019s mitigation efforts to avert foreseeable risks of recurrent illegal drug use.\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s drug use\nand associated judgment lapses, Applicant fails to mitigate security concerns related to\n\n8\nhis drug use and associated criminal conduct.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with\nrespect to the allegations covered by Guidelines H and J.\nPersonal Conduct concerns\nTrust concerns over Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness are\nraised under Guideline E as the result of his answering in the negative to an\ninterrogatory question inquiring about his past drug purchases.   Applicant attributed his\nnegative answer to his misunderstanding of the meaning of the term \u201cpurchase.\u201d By\nclaiming he never purchased illegal drugs, he meant only that he had never bought\ndrugs for profit or distributed drugs.  He did not consider his sharing the expense of\npsilocybin with his girlfriend to be a purchase. Applicant\u2019s explanation, considering the\ncircumstances surrounding the furnished information at the time, is a plausible\ninterpretation and credible enough to avert inferences of falsification. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s failure to address $2,200 worth of accumulated parking\ntickets raises security concerns about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness that\ncannot be mitigated without some documented showing on his part that he has\naddressed his parking tickets.  Applicant has not provided any evidentiary proof in the\nhearing or after the hearing that he has paid the tickets or otherwise resolved any of\nthem with the courts or parking enforcement officials. \nAppraised by themselves, Applicant\u2019s accumulation of unpaid parking tickets is\nnot sufficiently security-significant to warrant the denial of a security clearance.  When\nconsidered contextually with his use of illegal drugs, his unpaid tickets become more\nsecurity-significant.  Considered together, they reflect a continuing pattern of disregard of\npublished rules and policies that bear on his demonstrated willingness to adhere to rules\nand guidelines designed to protect classified information. \nSo, under Guideline E, core judgment and trustworthiness concerns covered by\nD.C. \u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which,\nwhen combined with all available information supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may\nnot properly safeguard protected information,\u201d have some applicability to this case.\nThese concerns cannot be isolated from his past use of illegal drugs.\nFor his candid acknowledgment of his parking tickets and expressed commitment\nto address them, Applicant is entitled to take some advantage of MC \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe\nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the\nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors\nthat caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior\nis unlikely to recur,\u201d of the mitigating conditions in the personal conduct guideline.\nWithout some evidence of addressing his tickets, though, he may not take full advantage\nof this mitigating condition. \n\n9\nWhole-person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount related\nconcerns about his judgment and trustworthiness attributable to his past failures to\naddress the large number of parking tickets he accumulated. While he established  some\nprobative evidence of his overall judgment and trustworthiness, his education and\nprofessional achievements are not enough to overcome concerns raised by his parking\nticket accumulations when considered, not independently, but in concert with his prior\nabuse of illegal drugs.\nTo be sure, Applicant\u2019s reasons for not addressing his parking tickets sooner with\nhis available resources are not fully apparent. And because motivation is never easy to\nobjectively establish, the placement of reasonable time lines on clearance applicants to\ntest and absolve them of recurrence risks makes safe and  practical sense when\nbalancing the interests of protecting national security with the interests of  those who\nseek access to the nation\u2019s secrets.  This balance has been carefully weighed and must\nbe resolved against Applicant on the strength of the evidence developed in this record.\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\naccumulation of unpaid parking tickets, Applicant fails to mitigate Guideline E security\nconcerns related to his demonstrated judgment lapses associated with his failure to\naddress these tickets. Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to his drug purchase\nomission in his interrogatory response.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE H: (DRUG INVOLVEMENT):          AGAINST APPLICANT\n   \nSubparas. 1.a through 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nGUIDELINE J: (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubpara. 2.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):         AGAINST  APPLICANT\n   \nSubpara. 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubpara. 3 .b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate the government\u2019s financial considerations security\nconcern. Clearance is denied.\nOn February 16, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 9, 2009, admitting all of the allegations\nexcept subparagraphs 1.f and 1.p. He requested a hearing, and the case was assigned\nto me on May 27, 2009. On June 11, 2009, a notice of hearing was issued scheduling\nthe case for July 17, 2009. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. I received four\nSeptember 14, 2009\n\nISCR Case No. 03-07826 (App. Board, June 17, 2005) at 3.\n1\n2\ngovernment exhibits, 14 Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. At Applicant\u2019s\nrequest, I left the record open at the conclusion of the hearing to allow him to submit\nadditional exhibits. By the close of the record, he had not submitted any supplementary\nexhibits. The transcript was received on July 15, 2009.\nPreliminary Rulings\nI. At the hearing\u2019s conclusion, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR as\nfollows:\n1.t.\nYou failed to timely file your state and federal income tax returns for\ntax year 2008.\nApplicant did not object, and I granted the motion. Applicant then admitted the\nallegation. \nII. SOR subparagraph 1.f alleges Applicant owes a debt to an unidentified\nmedical provider. This allegation is overbroad because it does not identify a specific\ncreditor. Although an SOR does not have to satisfy the strict requirements of a criminal\nindictment, it must still place an applicant on adequate notice of the allegations so that\nhe may have a reasonable opportunity to respond and prepare a defense.1\nSubparagraph 1.f. does not meet this threshold; therefore, I conclude that it is not\njusticiable.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 39-year-old man with two teenage children. His marriage of 17\nyears ended in divorce in 2008, and his ex-wife has physical custody of the children.\nApplicant served in the U.S. Navy from 1989 to 1999. He was honorably\ndischarged. While in the Navy, he earned five Navy Achievement Medals, and one Navy\nCommendation Medal (Tr. 14). Since leaving the Navy, he has worked for various\ngovernment contractors as a database administrator. Currently, he earns $78,000\nyearly.\nApplicant is highly respected on the job. According to his team leader, his\nperformance is stellar (Exhibit B). A senior-level supervisor, whose familiarity with\nApplicant\u2019s work quality spans more than 15 years, characterizes him as a \u201cSubject\nMatter Expert, always willing to help out . . . coworkers\u201d (Exhibit C).\nAs of January 2009, Applicant had accrued approximately $43,000 of delinquent\ndebt. Four of the delinquencies resulted in judgments against Applicant; they include a\nlate car note (SOR subparagraph 1.o), late payments owed to a child care center (SOR\nsubparagraph 1.p), and two judgments for back rent (SOR subparagraphs 1.q and 1.r).\n\n3\nOther delinquencies include debts owed to a check cashing company (SOR\nsubparagraph 1.a), medical institutions (SOR subparagraphs 1.b and 1.c), utility\ncompanies (SOR subparagraphs 1.d, 1.e, 1.g), department stores (SOR subparagraphs\n1.h, 1.i, 1.n), and credit card companies (SOR subparagraphs 1.j - 1.m, and 1.s).\nApplicant attributes his financial problems to his 2007 marital separation and\nsubsequent divorce in 2008 (Tr. 12). He has satisfied the debt listed in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.s, in the amount of $4,440, through a wage garnishment (Exhibits E, K,\nL). Also, he satisfied two unlisted delinquencies, totalling $1,833, through wage\ngarnishments (Tr. 21; Exhibits H - I).\nApplicant admits that the company that financed his automobile purchase\nobtained a judgment for $21,234, as SOR subparagraph 1.o alleges, but he disputes\nthe amount due. As of the hearing date, the creditor was in the process of selling the car\nat auction, and had not established a deficiency amount (Tr. 32).\nApplicant acknowledges that his children had attended a day care center that\nobtained the $713 judgment, as listed in SOR subparagraph 1.p (Tr. 33). However, he\ncontacted both the day care center and its regional headquarters, and neither had a\nrecord of any delinquency (Tr. 33).\nApplicant has not contacted the other creditors or organized any payment plans\n(Tr. 36). His wage garnishments absorbed all of his disposable income (Tr. 42). The last\ngarnishment, however, was released in May 2009. Now that Applicant has completed\npaying the creditors through the wage garnishments, he is prepared to begin satisfying\nhis remaining delinquencies. He intends to apply the monthly $1,600 he had used to\npay these garnishments toward the remaining delinquencies (Tr. 40-41).\nThe week before the hearing, he met with a credit counselor (Tr. 41, 52). They\ndiscussed the development of a payment plan and a budget, but had not finalized either\n(Id.). As of the hearing date, Applicant had filed neither his state nor federal income tax\nreturns for tax year 2008, nor had he had filed for extensions (Tr. 50). Although he\nanticipates getting refunds, he has not filed his returns because he \u201c[hasn\u2019t] taken the\ntime to do it\u201d (Id.).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\n\n4\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a),\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d\nAlthough Applicant\u2019s marital separation and divorce contributed to his financial\nproblems, the only progress he has made toward satisfaction of his delinquencies has\nbeen through wage garnishments. Also, he consulted a credit counselor just two weeks\nbefore the hearing. Moreover, Applicant, as of the hearing date, had neither filed his\n2008 state and federal income tax returns, nor had he filed for extensions.\nConsequently, AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d is inapplicable.\nApplicant deserves credit for consulting a credit counselor. However, the recency\nof this step and his failure to file his federal or state income tax returns limit the\napplicability of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) \u201cthe person has received, or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem, and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved, or is\nunder control,\u201d and 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\nApplicant contacted his children\u2019s day care center and their corporate\nheadquarters to inquire about the alleged judgment in their favor, as alleged in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.p. Neither had any record of a delinquency. AG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual\nhas a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause\n\n5\nof the problem, and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute\nor provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,\u201d applies to SOR subparagraph 1.p.\nI resolve it in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were mostly caused by his 2008 divorce. His\nprogress at debt satisfaction has occurred solely through wage garnishment. Also, I was\ntroubled by his failure to file his federal or state income taxes. The negative security\nimplication of this failure was compounded by the fact that he probably was going to\nreceive refunds - money which could have been applied to his delinquent debts. Upon\nevaluating this case in the context of the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant\nhas failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concern. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.g - 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q - 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\n\n6\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

DeLaney, Esquire, Department  Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the written record in this case, I conclude that \nApplicant failed to rebut or mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nB, Foreign Influence. His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and certified a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on \nMarch 17, 2005.1 On July 8, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under  \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n1 The SF 86 in the FORM is dated August 12, 2009. Included with the SF 86 is a paper, purportedly \nsigned by Applicant and dated March 17, 2005. The record also includes Applicant\u2019s personal subject \ninterview, which occurred on May 3, 2006. In responses to DOHA interrogatories, dated June 18, 2009, \nand May 6, 2010, Applicant provided additional information.     \nNovember 30, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \n  \n \nOn August 10, 2010, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested that \nhis case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing. The Government compiled its \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 15, 2010. The FORM contained \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 7. In addition, the Government compiled facts \nabout Taiwan from 15 official U.S. government publications and requested that I take \nadministrative notice of those facts. By letter dated September 16, 2010, DOHA \nforwarded a copy of the FORM, the factual summary containing information about \nTaiwan, and the source documents from which those facts were derived to Applicant, \nwith instructions to submit any additional information and/or objections within 30 days of \nreceipt.  Applicant received the file on September 19, 2010. His response was due on \nOctober 29, 2010. He did not submit any information or raise any objections within the \nrequired time period. On November 8, 2010, the case was assigned to me for a \ndecision.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains four allegations that raise security concerns under Guideline \nB, Foreign Influence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted three Guideline B allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c.) He denied the \nallegation at SOR \u00b6 1.d.  Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 30 years old, never married, and employed by a government \ncontractor as an embedded software developer. In 2002, Applicant earned a Bachelor \nof Science degree, and in 2004, he earned a Master of Science degree. Both degrees \nwere conferred by a U.S. university. Applicant seeks a security clearance for the first \ntime. (Item 5.) \n \n \nIn May 2006, Applicant was interviewed about his citizenship status by an \nauthorized investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).2 Applicant \ntold the investigator that he was born in the United States while his parents, citizens of \nthe Republic of China (Taiwan), were in the United States pursuing higher education. \nShortly after Applicant\u2019s birth, his family returned to Taiwan. When Applicant was about \nfour years old, his family moved back to the United States, where, for about ten years, \nApplicant\u2019s father was employed by the government of Taiwan. In 1994 Applicant\u2019s \nfamily returned to Taiwan, where he attended high school. After graduating from high \nschool in 1998, Applicant returned to the United States to attend college. Applicant\u2019s \nparents remained in Taiwan, where his father took a position as president of a private \ncompany. Applicant\u2019s mother is a homemaker in Taiwan. Applicant has in-person \ncontact with his parents approximately twice a year, when they come to the United \nStates to visit him. (Item 5; Item 6.) \n \n \n2 Applicant reviewed the investigator\u2019s summary of the interview, and, on June 18, 2009, he provided \nadditional clarifying information. He did not dispute the accuracy of the information recited herein. (Item \n6.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant, a native-born U.S. citizen, held dual citizenship with Taiwan. During \nhis college years, he used his Taiwanese passport to travel from the United States to \nTaiwan to visit his parents during summer vacations. He used his Taiwan passport for \ntravel to Taiwan because it was more convenient than obtaining a visa and using his \nU.S. passport to enter Taiwan. After 2000, Applicant did not renew his Taiwanese \npassport. In response to DOHA interrogatories, he reported that he no longer \npossesses a Taiwanese passport.  (Item 5; Item 6; Item 7.) \n \n \nWhile he was living in Taiwan, Applicant participated in Taiwan\u2019s universal health \ninsurance, a benefit provided to those holding Taiwanese citizenship. He does not \nexercise this benefit while living in the United States. Applicant stated that he was \nwilling to renounce his Taiwanese citizenship if required to do so to hold a U.S. security \nclearance. (Item 6.)     \n \n \nApplicant has a brother who is a naturalized U.S. citizen and resides in the \nUnited States. Applicant\u2019s maternal grandparents are citizens of Taiwan and reside in   \nCanada. Applicant\u2019s maternal grandfather is a retired physician. His maternal \ngrandmother is a homemaker. Applicant has telephone contact with his grandparents \nonce a month. (Item 6.) \n \n \nIn his 2006 interview with the OPM investigator, Applicant stated that a family \nfriend, a U.S. citizen, worked for the government of Taiwan in the United States. \nApplicant identified this person because he considered her to be his closest contact with \na foreign government. The SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.d. that the family friend was a current \nemployee of the Taiwanese government. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied \nallegation 1.d. and stated that the person had retired from her position with the \ngovernment of Taiwan. (Item 4; Item 6.) \n \n \nApplicant also reported in his 2006 interview with the OPM investigator that two \nof his uncles on his father\u2019s side served in the Taiwanese military. One of the uncles \nwas on active duty in 2006; the other was retired. In response to DOHA interrogatories \nin May 2010, Applicant reported that \u201call relatives in military have retired.\u201d (Item 7 at 3.) \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant reported at least five trips to \nCanada between 2004 and 2009. His most recent trip to Taiwan occurred in December \n2007. (Item 7.) \n  \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts about Taiwan, as contained in \nofficial U.S. government documents provided by Department Counsel to Applicant in the \nFORM: \n \nIn 1949, following a civil war between the Nationalist Chinese and the \nChinese Communist Party, two million refugees, predominately Nationalist \nmembers and supporters, fled from mainland China to Taiwan. That same \nyear, Communists in mainland China established the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC or China), and Chiang Kai-shek established a separate, \n\n \n4 \n \n \nprovisional capital for his government in Taipei, Taiwan. The PRC does \nnot recognize Taiwan\u2019s independence and insists that there is only \u201cone \nChina.\u201d After long recognizing Taiwan, on January 1, 1979, the U.S. \nformally recognized the government of the PRC as the sole legal \ngovernment of China. The U.S. does not support independence for \nTaiwan and is committed to a \u201cone-China policy,\u201d under the Taiwan \nRelations Act, signed into law on April 10, 1979. \n \nTaiwan is a multi-party democracy that has significant economic contacts \nwith China, and it has developed a strong economy since its separation \nfrom the PRC in 1949. Despite substantial economic ties, the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China did not hold any official talks with Taiwan from October \n1998 until June 2008. Moreover, the governments of Taiwan and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China still do not negotiate directly. \u201cThe military\u2019s \nprimary mission is the defense of Taiwan against the P.R.C., which is \nseen as the predominant threat and which has not renounced the use of \nforce against Taiwan.\u201d The PRC\u2019s Ministry of State Security is the \n\u201cpreeminent civilian intelligence collection agency in China,\u201d and maintains \nintelligence operations in Taiwan, through a bureau utilizing PRC nationals \nwith Taiwan connections. \n \nTaiwan is known to be an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence, \nand the National Counterintelligence Center\u2019s 2000 Annual Report to \nCongress of Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage lists \nTaiwan as being among the most active collectors of U.S. economic and \nproprietary information. The 2000 Report highlights specific incidents \nwherein Taiwan engaged in attempts to acquire export-restricted products. \n \nThere have been various cases involving the illegal export, or attempted \nillegal export, of U.S. restricted, dual use technology to Taiwan, including: \n(1) laser gun aimer/ sights; (2) measuring probes controlled for nuclear \nnonproliferation and national security reasons; (3) centrifugal pumps that \nare controlled for chemical and biological weapons and anti-terrorism \nreasons; (3) Metal Organic Vapor Disposition tools controlled for national \nsecurity and anti-terrorism reasons; (5) fluid control valves that are \ncontrolled for national security, foreign policy, nonproliferation or anti-\nterrorism reasons; radio communication encryption modules; and (7) \ncontrolled nickel powder. \n \n(FORM  at 5-7; footnotes and citations omitted.) \n \n \nAdditionally, in December 2005, a high U.S. official pled guilty to removing \nclassified materials and to providing false statements to the U.S. Government. The \nofficial was engaged in a relationship with an intelligence officer employed by the \nforeign intelligence agency of the government of Taiwan. (FORM at 8.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking to obtain a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n\n \n6 \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nUnder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, \u201c[f]oreign contacts and interests may be a \nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may \nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any \nforeign interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6. \n \n \nAdditionally, adjudications under Guideline B \u201ccan and should consider the \nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with \nthe risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6. \n \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under the Foreign Influence \nguideline. Applicant\u2019s close contacts and relationships with family members who are \ncitizens of Taiwan raise security concerns under disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n7(b). AG \u00b6 7(a) reads: \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if \nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b) reads: \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant provided some credible information to establish that his family friend \nwas retired and no longer employed by the Taiwanese government. Accordingly, the \nSOR allegation at \u00b6 1.d. is concluded for Applicant. \n \nWhile the United States and Taiwan share common democratic values, Taiwan is \nstrongly focused on protecting itself from possible military action from the PRC. Toward \nthat end, Taiwan is known to be an active collector of U.S. economic and proprietary \ninformation that could assist in strengthening its defensive position, and it has targeted \n\n \n7 \n \n \nU.S. government organizations in order to acquire U.S. technology. American citizens \nwith immediate family members who are citizens or residents of Taiwan could be \nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation, inducements, or pressure by those seeking to \nacquire proprietary or otherwise restricted U.S. technology for the benefit of Taiwan.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father and mother are citizens and residents of Taiwan. Applicant\u2019s \nfather was employed by the Taiwanese government in the United States for ten years \nduring Applicant\u2019s childhood. He now is employed as the president of a private company \nin Taiwan. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s maternal grandparents are citizens of Taiwan who \nreside in Canada. Applicant sees his parents about twice a year when they travel to the \nUnited States to visit him. He has monthly telephone contact with his grandparents in \nCanada.   \n \n \nSeveral mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 might be applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  If \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are \nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the U.S.,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(a) might apply.  If \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, \neither because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(b) might \napply.  If \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that \nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d \nthen AG \u00b6 8(c) might apply. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with his parents and grandparents are neither casual \nnor infrequent, but are based on long-standing family ties of affection and obligation. \nApplicant is in close familial contact with his parents and grandparents, all of whom are \ncitizens of Taiwan. His parents travel to the United States to visit him.  \n \nTaiwan is an active collector of U.S. proprietary information. Both of Applicant\u2019s \nparents have been educated in the United States, and they are familiar with the \nworkings of the U.S. federal government. For approximately ten years, Applicant\u2019s \nfather was employed by the Taiwanese government in the United States. Several of his \nrelatives, now retired, served in the Taiwanese military. Nothing in the record suggests \nthat Applicant\u2019s parents, grandparents, and extended family in Taiwan know of the \nnature of his work as a federal contractor, but if they did, this could raise additional \nconflict of interest concerns that might also threaten U.S. security interests. Applicant \nfailed to meet his burden of providing information to rebut or mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). I therefore conclude that the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) are inapplicable. \n \n \nNothing in Applicant\u2019s answers to the Guideline B allegations in the SOR \nsuggested he was not a loyal U.S. citizen. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 \n\n \n8 \n \n \nspecifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is an intelligent and well-\neducated professional with a specialty in software development. He has close familial \nties with his parents and grandparents, all of whom are citizens of Taiwan. He is in \nfrequent contact with his family members. Applicant\u2019s father was employed by the \ngovernment of Taiwan and worked in the United States for ten years. Taiwan actively \nseeks to collect proprietary information from U.S. businesses and government \ncontractors. Because of his close relationships with Taiwanese citizens, Applicant could \nbe vulnerable to foreign exploitation, inducement, pressure, or coercion.   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under the   \nforeign influence adjudicative guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.: Against Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.:                       For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n                        Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He also used other \nillegal substances including psychedelic mushrooms (psilocybin), inhalants, and \nprescription drugs. He tried mushrooms one time. He used the inhalant nitrous oxide less \nthan 10 times between 2003 and 2006. Applicant also sometimes shared Valium, \nVicodin, or Adderall when they were prescribed for his friends. Although they were not \nprescribed for him, he used these painkillers about ten times between 2003 and 2007. \n(GE 1, 3; Tr. 30-38, 40-42) \n \nOccasionally, Applicant talks with two friends by telephone with whom he used \ndrugs in the past. They do not live in the same city as Applicant. They no longer use \nillegal drugs, nor does Applicant's current roommate. Applicant stopped using illegal \ndrugs about six months before he graduated college because he \u201cgot sick of them and I \nwas like, you know, it\u2019s time for a new and better life.\u201d He has no intent to use illegal \ndrugs in the future, and testified that he is, \u201cbasically done with that\u2026I\u2019m never going to \nrevisit that.\u201d (Tr. 50) Drug tests were administered to Applicant by prospective employers \nin February and June 2008. He passed both tests. He has never had drug counseling or \nparticipated in a drug treatment program. Applicant disclosed his drug use on his security \nclearance application, during his security interview, and in his interrogatory responses. \n(GE 1, 2, 3; Tr. 48-53, 56) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor submitted a letter of reference. After supervising \nApplicant for one-and-one-half years, he noted that Applicant shows good judgment, and \nis responsible and trustworthy. He volunteers for additional tasks, and on one project, \nassumed the leadership role when the leader was not available. He has been with \nApplicant at social events and found that Applicant was discreet in his behavior, and he \nshowed good judgment when discussing professional matters in social settings. He \nrecommends Applicant be granted a security clearance (AE A).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \n \n3 \n\n \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised AG.3 \nDecisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of \nthe Guidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties \nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement). \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest4 for an applicant to either \nreceive or continue to have access to classified information. The government bears the \ninitial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary \ndecision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the \ngovernment must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the \ngovernment meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate \nthe government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an \napplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.5 A person who has access to classified \ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and \nconfidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring each \napplicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will \nprotect the national interests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national \ninterest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access in favor of the government.6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \nreliability \nand \n                                                 \n3 Directive. 6.3. \n4 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n5 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n6 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n \n4 \n\n \ntrustworthiness both because it may impair judgment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nOf the eight disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 25, the following are relevant:  \n \n(a) any drug abuse; and \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia. \n \nApplicant admits to illegally using marijuana, cocaine, inhalants, mushrooms, and non-\nprescribed medications. He sometimes purchased the marijuana and cocaine. He also \nexperimented with growing marijuana. He used marijuana over a seven-year period, \nbeginning when he was 14 and ending when he was 22. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was \nfrequent, long-standing, and demonstrated poor judgment and willingness to break the \nlaw. Both disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 26 includes two relevant mitigating conditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such \nas:  \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused;  \n \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation. \n \n \nBetween the ages of 18 and 22, Applicant used cocaine, mushrooms, inhalants \nand painkillers infrequently, averaging about twice per year in each case. His use of \nmarijuana is more problematic, because it was frequent and long-standing. However, \nApplicant credibly testified that he ended his use in December 2007, more than two \nyears ago. Since then, he has been working steadily at a full-time, professional position. \nAccording to his supervisor, he is performing responsibly, and is trustworthy and \n \n5 \n\n \n \n6 \ndependable. These facts support a finding of current trustworthiness and reliability. AG \n\u00b6 26(a) applies. \n \n \nMitigation is also available under AG \u00b6 26(b) (1) through (3). Applicant no longer \nassociates with drug users. He does not live in the same city as his friends with whom \nhe used drugs. He does sometimes speak with these two friends by telephone, but they \nalso have ended their illegal drug use. He is no longer in the college environment where \nhe used drugs, and his current roommate does not use drugs. Applicant has abstained \nfrom illegal drugs for more than two years, and both of the drug tests administered by \nemployers in 2008 were negative. His conduct demonstrates a commitment to avoiding \nillegal drug use. AG \u00b6 26(b) applies. \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n  \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under the guideline in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case.  \n \n \nApplicant used illegal drugs between the ages of 14 and 22. Most were used on \nan occasional basis, but his marijuana use was frequent and long-standing. He was \nmotivated by a desire to fit in with his friends. He ended his marijuana use in December \n2007, and has refrained from using illegal drugs for more than two years. He decided on \nhis own to end his drug use when he realized that he was finishing college, entering the \nwork world, and wanted to change his lifestyle. He fully disclosed his drug use during \nthe security clearance process. He now holds a responsible, full-time job where he has \nperformed dependably for the past one-and-one-half years. His decision to end his \nillegal drug use, as well as his demonstrated on-the-job reliability, show increased \nmaturity and reflect positively on his current trustworthiness.  \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \nOverall, the record evidence satisfies the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. for all these reasons, I conclude applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the drug involvement guideline. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.f.:  \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow applicant access to \nclassified information.

The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \nIn a notarized response dated August 6, 2009, Applicant admitted five and\ndenied seven of the Guideline F allegations set forth in the SOR, but did not address\nthe allegation raised under Guideline E. She requested a decision be made without a\nhearing. Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material (FORM), dated\nAugust 28, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on September 8, 2009, but declined to\nfile a response to its contents. On November 2, 2009, the Director, DOHA, forwarded\nNovember 9, 2009\n\n Response to the SOR at 2.\n      1\n FORM, Item 11 (Investigator\u2019s Notes, dated Jun. 27, 2008 \u2013 Jul. 2, 2008).\n      2\n FORM, Item 12 (Investigator\u2019s Notes, dated Oct. 3, 208, \u2013 Oct. 28, 2008).\n      3\nResponse to the SOR at 1.\n      4\n2\nthe case for assignment to an administrative judge for administrative determination. I\nwas assigned the case that day. Based upon a review of the case file, submissions,\nand exhibits, I find Applicant failed to meet her burden regarding the security concerns\nraised under Guideline F and Guideline E. Security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 29-year-old mail clerk who has worked for the same defense\ncontractor since 2007. She earned a high school diploma in 1999. Currently single, she\nhas an 11-year old child. In choosing an administrative determination without hearing,\nApplicant chose to rely on the written record. Because her submissions are brief, the\nfacts of record are exceptionally scant. \nIn 2004, Applicant was assaulted and stabbed by a former boyfriend. Her injuries\nprecluded her from employment for about two years. In 2005 or 2006, Applicant broke\nan apartment lease. The apartment owner pursued a judgment against her in the\namount of approximately $2,500 in 2006. She satisfied the judgment in 2007 or 2008.1\nAlso in 2006, she committed an act constituting welfare fraud. After paying restitution in\nthe amount of $850 in September 2007, Applicant pled guilty to the charge.  \n2\nBetween 2006 and 2007, Applicant incurred medical bills when she suffered\nfrom pneumonia. She could not pay the bills and the illness prevented her from working\nfor an unspecified period. She told investigators in 2008 that she had made\narrangements to pay her medical debts.  In her 2009 response to the SOR, however,\n3\nshe denied the debts, stating she had been \u201cenrolled in [a] medical insurance plan at\nthe time [the] cost [was] incurred. All costs should be covered by medical insurance.\u201d4\nNo explanation was made as to why she changed her position regarding the resolution\nof these delinquent debts and no evidence of coverage was submitted. During her\nillness, Applicant also became delinquent on one or more telephone accounts. She told\ninvestigators in October 2008 that she planned to pay the balance or balances in\nNovember 2008. The balances referenced in the SOR remain unpaid.\nOn February 28, 2008, Applicant completed a SF86. In response to a question\ninquiring as to whether she ever had been over 180 days delinquent on any accounts or\nwas currently 90 days delinquent on any debts, Applicant answered \u201cNo.\u201d \nAs of October 2008, Applicant had a gross income of approximately $35,000.\nHer bi-weekly net income was approximately $1,300. She did not receive child support,\ndisability, or retirement. Her monthly expenses included a cell phone for about $110,\n\n FORM, Item 12 (Investigator\u2019s Notes, dated Oct. 3, 208, \u2013 Oct. 28, 2008) at 4.\n      5\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

Jan. 27, 1995).\n      8\n3\nclothes and food for her child amounting to about $200, clothes and food for herself\ntotaling about $150, entertainment expenses of approximately $60, and about $150 a\nmonth toward repayment of misused food stamps. Amounting to about $670, Applicant\nshould have about $630 leftover each month. Applicant has no assets, real estate, or\ninvestments. She described her financial situation as \u201cgood.\u201d  The record does not\n5\nreflect her current financial status. There is no indication that she received financial\ncounseling or is in repayment on any of her remaining delinquent debts.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, they\nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. An\nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common\nsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number\nof variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d An administrative judge must\nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe United States Government (government) must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted\nby applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something\n6\nless than a preponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the\n7\napplicant.  \n8\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\n\n See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive\n      9\ninformation).\n Id.\n      10\n Id.\n      11\n EO 10865 \u00a7 7.\n      12\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n      13\n4\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d  \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security\n9\nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any\n10\nreasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive\ninformation must be resolved in favor of protecting such information.  The decision to\n11\ndeny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the\nloyalty of an applicant.  Nor does it reflect badly on that person\u2019s character. It is merely\n12\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) to be the most pertinent to the\ncase. Conditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate such\nconcerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, \u201cfailure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nan unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  The Directive sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions under\n13\nthis guideline. Here, Applicant admits some of the dozen delinquent debts cited in the\nSOR. While she denies the majority of the remaining debts at issue, she only offered\nevidence that one of those debts, the obligation noted at SOR allegation \u00b6 1.e, was\naddressed or paid. Consequently, both Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition\n\n5\n(FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and \u00b6 19(c) (a history of\nnot meeting obligations) apply.\nFor an unspecified time between 2004 and 2006, Applicant could not work due\nto injuries sustained in an attack by her ex-boyfriend. She was also unable to work\nduring an unspecified time between 2006 and 2007 owing to a case of pneumonia.\nBecause the periods of her incapacity are undefined, Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) applies to a limited extent.\nApplicant admitted $530 in debts, referencing SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.f \u2013 1.h for\n$217, $204, and $109, respectively. Although she noted that the allegations set forth in\nSOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.k \u2013 1.1 for $217 and $204, respectively, are duplicative of the\nallegations noted at \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g., she provided no evidence linking the two. Given the\nsimilarity in entries, however, this conclusion appears to be correct. Therefore, in\nidentifying the entries as duplicates, SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.k \u2013 1.1 have been\nconstructively addressed. Additionally, Applicant provided evidence that she satisfied\nthe debt owed to her former apartment complex. That debt is noted at SOR allegation \u00b6\n1.e, referencing a sum of approximately $729. \nRemaining at issue are delinquent debts amounting to about $9,850. Although\nApplicant denied the allegations in SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.e and 1.i, no evidence\nthat the medical debts at issue were ever covered by insurance or that the other\naccounts were paid, are in repayment, or were formally disputed was submitted.\nAlthough the 2004 attack on Applicant was an extraordinary event and her need\nfor recuperation unexpected, the debts still at issue are multiple in number and remain\nlargely unaddressed. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a)\n(\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) does not apply.\nThere is no evidence that Applicant received financial counseling. There is no\nevidence that she followed through on any of the payments she told investigators she\nintended to make in 2008, nor is there evidence that she formally disputed any of the\ndelinquent debts she denies with any of the credit reporting agencies. No\ndocumentation was submitted showing that she had medical insurance when her\nmedical debts were incurred or that a medical insurer either assumed or paid the\nobligations. With the exception of the duplicative telecommunication bills noted above\nand the rental lease related debt noted in SOR allegation \u00b6 1.e, there is no evidence\nany of the remaining obligations have been addressed. Consequently, neither FC MC\nAG \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d) nor\nFC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts\u201d) applies. The facts provide some mitigation for the creation\n\n AG \u00b6 15.\n      14\n6\nof the debts at issue, but fail to mitigate her failure to address the majority of the debts\nat issue. Security concerns remain unmitigated.\nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct\nUnder Guideline E \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  When Applicant completed her SF86, she had multiple delinquent\n14\naccounts. In completing that form, she denied having any delinquent debts. This is\nsufficient to initially raise Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities). \nA denial that one has delinquent debts is not self-evident proof that one\ndeliberately provided a misleading or false answer. Here, however, Applicant totally\nfailed to address the allegation raised and declined a hearing on the record. With no\nfacts upon which the applicable mitigating conditions can be considered, security\nconcerns remain unmitigated.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n                                                                                                               \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity\nat the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;\n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. As noted above, the\nultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant seeking a security clearance. \n\n7\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe scant facts available concerning this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors.\nApplicant is a 29-year-old mail clerk who endured difficult times in the early to mid-\n2000s. She was the victim of a brutal attack and suffered from pneumonia. As a\nconsequence of both, she was unable to work for unspecified periods. Although she\ndeclined to submit any current financial information, she described her financial\ncondition as of late 2008 as \u201cgood.\u201d While \u201cgood,\u201d there is no evidence she applies any\nof the approximately $650 leftover each month toward her delinquent debts. Nor is\nthere an explanation as to why she failed to make the payments she told investigators\nshe intended to make in 2008. Finally, she presented no plan depicting how she intends\nto address the nearly $10,000 in delinquent debt remaining at issue. As for personal\nconduct security concerns, Applicant failed to provide any explanation as to why she\ndenied having delinquent debts when she completed her SF86.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a determination as\nto an applicant\u2018s loyalty. Nor does it reflect badly on that person\u2019s character. It merely\nindicates an applicant failed to meet the strict guidelines established for issuing a\nclearance. In choosing a determination without a hearing, and in failing to submit more\ninformation, Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\nARTHUR E.

On May 28, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\n\n2\nrequested a hearing.  On September 8, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Carol G.\nRicciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her application\nof the mitigating conditions and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had numerous delinquent debts, which were caused in part\nby his decision to assist family members with their own financial problems.  For example, he had\nlent a family member two credit cards, upon which she made substantial charges.  Additionally, he\npermitted another to live in one of his two houses, making the mortgage payments.  However, this\nrelative failed to make the payments as promised.  Although the Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor\nfor several of the debts, she concluded that he had not demonstrated responsible behavior as to the\nremainder.  During the course of the hearing, Applicant admitted to an additional debt not alleged\nin the SOR.  The Judge did not consider this debt \u201cfor disqualifying purposes.\u201d  However, she stated\nthat she would consider it as an aspect of Applicant\u2019s financial history and as part of her \u201cwhole-\nperson\u201d analysis.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn May 28, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 10, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 21, 2009. \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on July 28, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on August 18, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4. \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 8, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant testified and did not offer any \ndocumentary evidence. The record was held open until August 25, 2009, to allow \nApplicant an opportunity to submit documents. He did so timely, and it was marked as \nExhibit (AE) A, which was admitted without objection.1 DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on August 25, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Issue \n \n \nThe Government moved to amend the SOR by striking SOR \u00b6 1.b because it was \na duplicate of \u00b6 1.a. There was no objection and the motion was granted. For simplicity \nthe allegations will not be renumbered and \u00b6 1.b will not be considered.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. He \ndenied the remaining allegation in \u00b6 1.c. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 29 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2003. He has been \nworking for his current employer, a federal contractor, since August 2008. He is \ndivorced and has one child, for whom he provides child support. He served in the Army \nReserve from 1997 to 2009 and was honorably discharged.2  \n \n \nIn 2004, Applicant resigned from his job and moved to a new city (City A). He \nhad difficulty finding a new job, but was confident he could get one. He was out of work \na couple of months. In June 2004, Applicant purchased a house in City A. He used \n$20,000 from his savings as a down payment. He got a job in July 2004 in a different \ncity (City B), so he moved. His sister (Sister C) lived in the house in City A and was \nresponsible for making the mortgage payments.3  \n \n \nApplicant bought a second house in City B, where he now worked. He did not put \na down payment on the house. He obtained a mortgage with an adjustable rate of \ninterest (ARM). He obtained two loans for the house with an 80% and 20% financing \nsplit. Sister C experienced financial difficulties and could not afford the $1,300 mortgage \npayment on the house in City A. She fell four months behind in payments. Applicant \npaid the back payments and told his sister she would have to move out. A second sister \n(Sister D) moved into the house and took over the mortgage payments. She and her \nhusband experienced financial difficulties and fell behind in paying the mortgage. They \nwere three months delinquent. Applicant obtained an equity line of credit for $30,000 \n \n1 HE I. \n \n2 Tr. 63-66. \n \n3 Tr. 28-32. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n(SOR \u00b6 1.g) and used this money to pay the mortgage, do repairs on the house and pay \nother bills. He then rented the house to non-family members.4  \n \n \nIn 2006, Applicant\u2019s uncle was in an accident. His mother asked him to lend her \nmoney so she could visit her brother. He gave her two credit cards to finance her \nexpenses. She made travel and hotel purchases of approximately $6,000 and $8,900 \nusing the credit cards. He also gave her approximately $7,000 in cash. She was \nsupposed to make the minimum payments on the credit cards, until she could pay them \nin full. She incurred these bills over a six-month period. Applicant was aware that she \nwas not making any payments during this time. He thought she would keep her promise \nand make payments, but she did not. She never paid anything. He paid one of the credit \ncards and still owes about $4,400 on the remaining card. This debt is not on the SOR.5 \n \nWhen Applicant missed a payment on the equity loan (SOR 1.g) on the house in \nCity A, his interest rate increased and he could not make payments on his other debts, \nincluding the credit card debts his mother incurred. After two years, his ARM on the City \nB house increased. He had anticipated when he bought the house with the ARM that he \nwould refinance the mortgage at a later date at a lower rate. Instead, the conventional \nrates had increased and he was unable to refinance the loan at a lower rate. He could \nnot afford to keep the house in City A. He later realized he could no longer afford the \nhouse in City B.6 \n \n \nIn 2006, Sister C told Applicant she would help their mother pay the credit card \ndebt his mother incurred in his name. In order to get the job she needed to help pay this \ndebt she would need a car. So Applicant co-signed on a car loan for Sister C because \nshe could not obtain a loan in her name. The car cost $17,000. The agreement was that \nApplicant would pay $100 a month for six months to help her with the car payments and \nshe was responsible for the remaining amount. Applicant stated he knew he could not \nafford the full payment. Sister C did not make payments for five months. Applicant made \npayments to catch-up. She told him she would try and make the payments, but did not. \nThe loan company contacted him and he advised them he could not afford the car and \nthey repossessed it. He understood he would likely owe the deficiency balance. SOR \n1.c ($9,609) is the car debt. Applicant settled the debt for $4,000. He paid the \nsettlement with a tax refund.7  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is the 20% equity loan on the City B house. SOR \u00b6 1.d is the 80% \nmortgage on the City B house. SOR \u00b6 1.g is the equity loan on the City A house. SOR \u00b6 \n1.f is the mortgage for the City A house. Applicant has an agreement with the creditor in \n \n4 Tr. 32-39. \n \n5 Tr. 21-26, 39, 84-88. This debt will not be considered for disqualifying purposes but will be \nconsidered when considering Applicant financial history and analyzing the \u201cwhole person.\u201d \n \n6 Tr. 41-42, 47, 73-74. \n \n7 Tr. 43-46, 68-71; Answer to SOR. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nSOR \u00b6 1.a to pay $854 a month for 12 months to settle the debt. He has made four \npayments so far.8 \n \nApplicant settled the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g ($32,000) for $1,300 a month for six \nmonths. He stated he has made five payments. He provided documents to show four \npayments have been made.9 \n \nApplicant stated that the properties in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($154,000) and 1.f ($146,000) \nwere foreclosed and sold. There is no balance remaining on them.10  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a credit card debt for an account opened in 2006, and defaulted in \nlate 2007 or early 2008. Applicant stated the account was sold and he has attempted to \ndetermine the collection creditor, but has been unsuccessful. He stated he last \nattempted to contact the creditor in February 2009. He intends to pay this debt. He is \nattending school and his employer reimburses him for the amount of his student loan he \nobtained to go to school. He will use the student loan money to pay his debts after his \ncompany reimburses him. Then he plans to pay off the student loans.11  \n \nApplicant has a budget on a spread sheet. He has not attended formal financial \ncounseling, but has read things on his own and has had financial classes when he \nattended college. He also familiarized himself, when he was in the military, with financial \nissues because he was responsible for advising young soldiers about potential financial \npitfalls.12  \n \nApplicant has about $2,400 in savings. He owns a Roth IRA that has about \n$5,000 and a 401k with about $4,000. He makes monthly contributions to his 401k \naccount. He has one active credit card.13  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n8 Tr. 37-41, 50-55; GE3; AE A. \n \n9 Tr. 52-55, 58; AE A \n \n10 Tr. 47-50, 61-63. \n \n11 Tr. 59-61, 90-93. \n \n12 Tr. 84-86. \n \n13 Tr. 80-81. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common-sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:   \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant defaulted on mortgages for two houses he purchased. He defaulted on \na car loan and has a credit card debt that remains unpaid. He was unable or unwilling to \npay his debts because he was financially overextended. I find the above disqualifying \nconditions have been raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant has a history of poor judgment and irresponsible behavior when \ndealing with his finances. He bought a house while unemployed. He then purchased a \nsecond house. His sister was responsible for making mortgage payments and failed to \ndo so. He then co-signed on a loan for this sister to purchase a car, which she then \nfailed to make the payments on. He already was aware of her unreliability in making \npayments on the mortgage. He gave his mother unlimited use of two of his credit cards. \nHe was aware she was not making payments on the cards as promised, but continued \nto allow her to increase the debt. He obtained an ARM knowing the rates could \nincrease, but he expected them to decrease and then planned to refinance the loan. \nWhen they increased he could not afford the mortgage payments. Applicant has since \ndefaulted on the mortgages on two houses which were then foreclosed. He defaulted on \nthe car loan and defaulted on one of the credit cards. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are \nstill current because he is still resolving a credit card debt. Although many of his debts \ninvolved his family, he was aware of their erratic financial history. These financial \nproblems were ultimately a result of behavior within his control. He did not act \nresponsibly under the circumstances, but rather continued to use poor judgment which \nfurther exacerbated his financial woes. I find mitigating conditions (a) and (b) do not \napply.  \n \nApplicant stated he is somewhat self-taught regarding financial issues and in the \npast was responsible for counseling young soldiers to ensure they did not get into \nfinancial problems. Therefore, this is not a case of a person being duped, but rather is a \nsituation where he took financial risks by assuming more debt than he could handle and \nrepeatedly relying on family members to make payments, even when he was aware of \ntheir past irresponsible actions. Applicant has payment plans to settle two of his debts, \nbut he still owes a large debt that he has not made any payments on. I find mitigating \ncondition (d) partially applies because of his settlement payments. I find mitigating \ncondition (c) does not apply because even though it is apparent to Applicant that he has \nmade serious financial mistakes, he has not sought financial counseling to help him \nprevent future errors. Applicant has developed a consistent pattern of poor financial \ndecisions that left a wake of foreclosure, defaults and delinquent debts. Without a \nconsistent record of responsible behavior it is too early to conclude the problem is under \ncontrol or being resolved. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n8 \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served in the military and \nwas honorably discharged. He consistently pays his child support. He has developed a \npattern of poor decision making and irresponsible behavior regarding his finances that \nraises questions about his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. He repeatedly \noverextended his finances and then defaulted on his obligations. The debts he settled \nwere for less than he actually received. He has not developed a consistent track record \nof responsible behavior. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under the \nguideline for Financial Considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.g: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly not in the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

He has failed to make any mortgage \npayments for approximately one year. Applicant has failed to rebut or mitigate the \ngovernment\u2019s security concerns under financial considerations and personal conduct. \nClearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on April 16, 2009, detailing security concerns under \nfinancial considerations and personal conduct. \n                                                          \n \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \n1 \n \n \n \nOctober 30, 2009\n\n \nOn May 6, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. On \nJune 15, 2009, I was assigned the case. On June 26, 2009, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing, scheduling the hearing to be held on July 14, 2009. For good cause that \nhearing was cancelled. On July 29, 2009, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, scheduling \nthe hearing, and it was held on August 25, 2009.  \n \n \nThe government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were admitted into \nevidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through N, \nwhich were admitted into evidence. The record was held open to allow additional \ninformation from Applicant. On August 27, 2009, additional material was submitted. \nDepartment Counsel had no objection to the material, which was admitted into the \nrecord as Ex. O. On September 1, 2009, the transcript (Tr.) was received. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he admits the factual allegations, with \nexplanations in \u00b6 1.a through \u00b6 1.f of the SOR. He denied the allegations, in \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2, and \n2.a of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support his request for \neligibility for a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s admissions of the SOR allegations are \nincorporated herein. After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following additional findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old combat engineer analyst who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since August 2007, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. \nFrom May 1991 until October 2007, Applicant was in the U.S. Army. (Tr. 45, Ex. 1) In \n1995, he became an officer. He left the Army as a major (O-4). Applicant\u2019s Officer \nEvaluation Report (OER), with a closeout date of May 31, 2007, recommended \nApplicant be promoted early to lieutenant colonel and that his duty performance was \nexcellent indicating he was a top 10% officer. (Ex. L) He served both in Iraq and \nAfghanistan (Ex. M). His awards and decorations include the Bronze Star and two \nMeritorious Service Medals. (Ex. N, O) Applicant had a clearance the entire time he was \nin the Army. (Tr. 74) \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is an active duty major in the U.S. Army. They married in June \n1998 and have four children. (Tr. 23-24) Applicant\u2019s yearly income is $118,000. (Tr. 86) \nHis wife\u2019s income is approximately $80,000, plus an additional nontaxable pay of \n$28,000, which includes allowances for housing and subsistence. Together their yearly \nincome is approximately $226,000. Applicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s net monthly income is \n$12,713. (Ex. H) Their net monthly income (gross income less monthly expenses) is \napproximately $12,700. (Ex. H) His monthly net income includes a mortgage payment of \napproximately $4,100, which currently is not being paid. Without making their mortgage \npayment their net monthly disposable income is approximately $5,800.  \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n2 \n \n \n \n\n \nIn January 2008, Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished for unpaid county property \ntax. In January 2008, Applicant began paying $700 per pay period. As of March 2008, \n$8,911 was owed. In the summer of 2008, the property tax was paid in full. (Tr. 86) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s daughter attended private school with $1,500 per month tuition. (Tr. \n84) The $21,167 debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a., which originated in 2007, was placed for \ncollection. (Ex. A) In May 2009, when Applicant answered the SOR, he stated he was \nco-signer on the debt. At that time, he stated he would make a $1,000 payment, and \nstarting in mid-May 2009, he would pay the creditor $250 per month. Applicant made \n$250 payments in May, June, and July 2009. (Ex. A)  \n \nAs to the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant stated he had been in contact with \nthe collection agency for the past year. In April 2009, he set up a monthly installment \nplan to pay $80 per month on this debt. The SOR lists the debt as having been charged \noff in the amount of $1,216; however, the amount owed as of October 2008 was \n$16,112. (Tr. 29, Ex. B) In March 2009, the creditor offered to settle the matter for \n$11,604. (Answer to SOR, Enclosure 3) As of August 18, 2009, Applicant had paid $960 \non this debt. (Ex. B) He is currently making $80 per month payments on this debt.  \n \n \nThe $8,247 credit card debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.c, as having been charged off, is \nnow in the amount of $12,157. The account became delinquent in 2005. (Tr. 69) The \ncreditor has offered to settle the matter for $6,000 payable in six $500 payments. \nApplicant\u2019s first payment was made April 2009. (Answer to SOR, Enclosure 4) The \ncreditor\u2019s August 7, 2009, letter states the account was settled in full for $5,562. (Ex. B)  \n \n \nIn 2005, Applicant and his wife were reassigned to the local area. They rented a \nhome. (Tr. 86) In July 2006, Applicant and his wife purchased their current home for \n$900,000, with no down payment. (Tr. 73, 74, 88) Applicant obtained a $720,000 first \nmortgage and a $180,000 second mortgage, both with the same company. (Tr. 89) A \nmonthly payment on the first mortgage was approximately $4,200 and $1,700 on the \nsecond. The two mortgage payments together total approximately $5,800 per month. \n(Tr. 89) In 2006, Applicant started to fall behind on his mortgage payments. (Tr. 72)  \n \nIn late 2008, Applicant stopped making his mortgage payments. (Tr. 91) As of \nApril 2009, he was past due in the amount of $13,476 on a mortgage of $789,000. \nApplicant is unsure how much he is currently past due on his mortgage. (Tr. 70) \nApplicant was looking to restructure the loan. He made a submission through the \nHelping Homeowners Program. (Tr. 32) The fair market value of their home is \napproximately $700,000. (Tr. 101) \n \n \nApplicant was past due in the amount of $150 on a student loan. He asserts he \npaid the past due amount. Applicant made monthly payments in September, October, \nand November 2008. Since March 2009, he has made six monthly payments on this \ndebt. (Ex. E)  \n \n3 \n \n \n \n \n\nApplicant owed the Defense Financial Accounting Service $3,194. At some point \nwhile in the military he was overpaid, and this is a recoupment action. (Tr. 36) He \narranged to repay the debt by making $62 monthly payments. (Answer to SOR, \nEnclosure 7) As of July 2009, the amount owed had been reduced to $1,709. (Ex. F) \n \n \nIn March 2008, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). He answered \u201cno\u201d to question 28.a, which asked if \nduring the prior seven years he had ever been more than 180 days delinquent on any \ndebt. He also answered \u201cno\u201d to question 28.b, which asked if he was currently more \nthan 90 days delinquent on any debt. He asserts his answers were not deliberately \nfalse. At the time he completed his SF 86, he was in discussions with some of his \ncreditors and did not believe he was delinquent on his debts. (Tr. 48) Applicant\u2019s wife \nhandles the family\u2019s finances and he was unaware of some of the delinquencies until \nafter the clearance process started.  \n \nWhen completing his e-QIP in March 2008, he knew he had fallen behind on his \nmortgage payments in 2006. (Tr. 75) Applicant stated the mortgage company changed \nand he believed he was only 30 days delinquent on his mortgage. (Tr. 75)  \n \n \nAt various times, Applicant and his wife have provided financial assistance to his \nsister, her sister, her brother, and her mother. (Tr. 44, 107) Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law \nwas unemployed following a back injury. Applicant helped his parents-in-law avoid \nforeclosure on their home. How the injury lead to the possible foreclosure of the \nparents-in-law\u2019s home, a home they had lived in for 25 years, was not explained. (Tr. \n107) They still support his sister-in-law. (Tr. 80) Applicant has instituted an accelerated \nmonthly payment plan and hopes to have his debts paid in full within three years. (Tr. \n57) Applicant and his wife assert they have consolidated their debt and developed a \nplan. His wife asserts they have paid $13,000 in debt. (Tr. 114) \n \n \nEven with yearly income in excess of a quarter million dollars, Applicant\u2019s debt to \nincome ratio is 39%. (Ex. D) The document from the credit union states that at this level \nthe debts seem manageable, but they should be paid before they spiral out of control. \n(Tr. 60, Ex. D) Applicant and his wife owe the IRS $10,000 for under withholding of \npersonal income tax. (Tr. 97)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n4 \n \n \n \n \n\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to financial problems: \n \n5 \n \n \n \n \n\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts as agreed. Absent \nsubstantial evidence of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a \nhistory of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt \nfree, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant has not paid his mortgage for almost a year. He hopes there will be \nsome type of program to save his house from foreclosure. His wages were garnished to \npay past due property tax on his home. He owes the IRS $10,000. He owes in excess of \n$15,000 for past due tuition for his daughter, which has been reduced from the more \nthan $21,000 previously owed. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; or \n6 \n \n \n \n\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant settled the $12,157 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) for $6,062. (Ex. C) AG \u00b6 20(d) \n\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts\u201d applies to this debt. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply to the remaining debts. The debts remain unpaid and \ncast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant and his wife \nmake more than $225,000 per year. With this income they are making monthly \npayments of $465 on the debts listed in the SOR. They assert they have paid off \n$13,000 in debt; however, they are not paying their $5,800 monthly mortgage. The \namount they assert has been paid represents approximately two months of mortgage \npayment.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply to the remaining debts. There was no loss of \nemployment; in fact, Applicant started his current job while he was on terminal leave \nfrom the Army. There has been no separation or divorce. Applicant and his wife chose \nto financially assist their relatives. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law was unemployed following \na back injury. How this lead to the possible foreclosure of the parents-in-law\u2019s home, a \nhome they had lived in for 25 years, was not explained.  \n \nApplicant and his wife make in excess of $225,000, yet their debt to income ratio \nis 39%. Applicant has not acted responsibly under the circumstances. They owe the IRS \n$10,000, and $15,000 for past due private tuition, which had been in excess of $21,000. \nThey have not paid their mortgage in a year, and are paying less than $500 per month \non their debts. They are hoping for a government program to prevent foreclosure on \ntheir home. There are no clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. AG & 20(e) does not apply because none of the \ndebts are being disputed.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct, which is \nconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or \nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n7 \n \n \n \n \n\nDeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written \ndocument or oral statement to the Government when applying for a security clearance \nis a security concern. The government has an interest in examining all relevant and \nmaterial adverse information about an applicant before making a clearance decision. \nThe government relies on applicants to truthfully disclose that adverse information in a \ntimely fashion, not when it is perceived to be prudent or convenient. Further, an \napplicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse information about himself provides some \nindication of his willingness to report inadvertent security violations or other security \nconcerns in the future, something the government relies on to perform damage \nassessments and limit the compromise of classified information.  \n \nIn March 2008, when completing his e-QIP, Applicant did not list all of his past \ndue obligations, but did list a garnishment which had started two months earlier. When \ncompleting his e-QIP, Applicant asserts he knew he had fallen behind on his mortgage \npayments in 2006, but believed he was only 30 days delinquent on his mortgage. (Tr. \n75) Knowing there had been a problem with late mortgage payments, he should have \nbeen especially attuned to the questions about his financial situation. He should have \ninvestigated his financial situation further before answering \u201cno\u201d when asked if he had \never been more than 180 delinquent on any debt or was currently more than 90 days \ndelinquent on any debt. His answers were false. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions related to personal conduct apply. Applicant did \nnot make a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the omission, concealment, or \nfalsification before being confronted with the facts (AG \u00b6 17(a)). There was no refusal or \nfailure to cooperate. AG \u00b6 17(b) \u201cthe refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or \nconcealment was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate \nadvice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully and \ntruthfully,\u201d does not apply.  \n \nThe offense is not minor, and the e-QIP was completed less than two years ago. \nKnowing he had experienced financial problems and not listing them on his \nquestionnaire casts doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment\u201d has limited applicability because the conduct was limited to two \nquestions on a single e-QIP.  \n \nApplicant has not acknowledged the bad behavior nor obtained counseling. AG \u00b6 \n17(d) \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change \nthe behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or \nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur\u201d does not apply.  \n \n8 \n \n \n \n \n\nAG \u00b6 17(e) \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d does not apply because there is no \nshowing of positive steps taken by the Applicant as to his conduct. AG \u00b6 17(g) \n\u201cassociation with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or occurs under \ncircumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, \njudgment, or willingness to comply with rules and regulations,\u201c does not apply because \nassociation with persons involved in criminal activity is not a factor. AG \u00b6 17(f) \u201cthe \ninformation was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability\u201d does not \napply because Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties have been substantiated.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nApplicant and his wife were U.S. Army majors when they decided to purchase a \n$900,000 home with no down payment. They knew their monthly mortgage would be \napproximately $6,000. They chose to put their daughter in private school and incur a \n$1,500 per month tuition. They currently make more than $225,000 per year. Had they \npaid their debts as agreed there would have been no security concern. They have not \npaid their mortgage in almost a year. Since they are not making their monthly mortgage \npayments their monthly net disposable income is $5,800, from which they are paying \nless than $500 per month on the SOR debts. Knowing he was experiencing financial \ndifficulties, he should have been more forthcoming about his financial problems when \nhe completed his e-QIP. \n \n9 \n \n \n \n \n\n10 \n \n \n \n \n \nWith their sizable annual income and with monthly payments of less than $500 \nper month on the SOR debts, I find Applicant has not acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Additionally, there is no clear indication that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial considerations and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Consideration: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d through 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted both allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 30 years old and works as computer technician for a federal contractor. He graduated from high school in 1997, and college in 2003, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree. From May 2006 to May 2007, he attended a computer training course and received a certificate of completion. While attending college full-time and computer training, Applicant worked between 20 to 40 hours a week at various jobs to support himself. He was unemployed for a period of six months after leaving a job, until he started his current job in June 2008.2 Applicant was working in approximately 2004 or 2005, but was underemployed. He obtained a line of credit from a bank for $15,000 to help him pay his expenses. He used this money over three to four years and made regular payments of approximately $400 to $500 on debt. In 2007, he borrowed another $5,000 because he wanted to pay off his car loan, so he could trade the car in and buy another one. He thought he could afford the payments. He paid off his car loan and bought a 2002 used car for $8,000. Shortly after this transaction, he lost his job. He had difficulty finding a job and received unemployment benefits. He stopped making payments on the two lines of credit. In November 2007, he contacted a debt consolidation company and set up a repayment plan for his two debts. ",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nOn April 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 21, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 27, 2009. \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on August 6, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on September 23, 2009. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2. \n \n1 \n \n \nOctober 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant did not object and they were admitted. A demonstrative exhibit was offered by \nthe government and was marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The Applicant testified and \noffered Exhibits (AE) A through E, which were admitted without objection. The record \nwas held open until October 7, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents, \nwhich he did. They were marked as AE F through I. The government had no objections \nand the documents were admitted and the record closed.1 DOHA received the transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on September 30, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted both allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 30 years old and works as computer technician for a federal \ncontractor. He graduated from high school in 1997, and college in 2003, earning a \nbachelor\u2019s degree. From May 2006 to May 2007, he attended a computer training \ncourse and received a certificate of completion. While attending college full-time and \ncomputer training, Applicant worked between 20 to 40 hours a week at various jobs to \nsupport himself. He was unemployed for a period of six months after leaving a job, until \nhe started his current job in June 2008.2  \n \n \nApplicant was working in approximately 2004 or 2005, but was underemployed. \nHe obtained a line of credit from a bank for $15,000 to help him pay his expenses. He \nused this money over three to four years and made regular payments of approximately \n$400 to $500 on debt. In 2007, he borrowed another $5,000 because he wanted to pay \noff his car loan, so he could trade the car in and buy another one. He thought he could \nafford the payments. He paid off his car loan and bought a 2002 used car for $8,000. \nShortly after this transaction, he lost his job. He had difficulty finding a job and received \nunemployment benefits. He stopped making payments on the two lines of credit. In \nNovember 2007, he contacted a debt consolidation company and set up a repayment \nplan for his two debts. It required him to make monthly payments of $459. He began \nthose payments in November 2007, and has not missed a payment to date.3 The \ncompany accumulates the payments and at a certain point determines that  there is \nenough money in Applicant\u2019s account to contact his creditor and negotiate a settlement \nto pay the debt with a lump sum settlement payment. Applicant accumulated enough \nmoney to settle the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. for $2,229 in July 2009.4 \n \n \n1 HE II. \n \n2 Tr. 34-40. \n \n3 AE B, C, G, H, I. \n \n4 Tr. 22-34, 41. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant continues to make monthly payments to the debt consolidator and \nanticipates he will have accumulated enough money to settle the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a by \nthe summer of 2010.5  \n \n \nApplicant took out student loans while attending college. He has consistently \nmade his monthly payments and has not been delinquent in repaying them, even when \nunemployed. He has a car loan and has not missed any payments. He has no other \ndelinquent debts. He has not had financial counseling because he could not afford to \npay a required fee. He is current on his state and federal income taxes.6  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s coworker testified on his behalf and considers him a polite and good \nperson, who works hard. She has never had any problem with his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment. She is aware that he is paying his delinquent debts.7 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s roommate also testified on his behalf. He is a fraud investigator for \nthe insurance industry and has served as a fraud investigator for the state, and also as \na police officer. He owns the house where he and Applicant live. Applicant always pays \nhis rent on time and has never been late. He is aware that Applicant takes every \nadvantage he can to work overtime and believes he lives within his means, and does \nnot buy frivolous things. He believes Applicant is committed to resolving his delinquent \ndebts. He knows Applicant made some poor financial decisions in the past, but he is \ntaking responsibility and has a solid plan for resolving his debts.8 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n5 Tr. 32-33. \n \n6 Tr. 43-47, 53-56. \n \n7 Tr. 63-71. \n \n8 Tr. 72-78; AE E. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19 and especially considered: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant accumulated two debts that he was unable to pay. They became \ndelinquent in 2007. I find there is sufficient evidence to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered the following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nWhen Applicant was underemployed and unemployed, he knew he was having \ntrouble making payments on the two debts so he sought assistance with a debt \nconsolidation company. He did not neglect his debts, but set up a plan to settle them. \nHe acted responsibly under the circumstances. He has been consistently making \npayments into the plan and has settled one of his delinquent debts. He continues to \nmake regular payments into the plan and anticipates settling the remaining debt once \nhe has accumulated enough money. Applicant had a period of underemployment and \nunemployment that affected his ability to pay his bills. He is current on all other \nobligations, including his student loans. Applicant acted responsibly and there are clear \nindications that he will resolve the remaining debt with his repayment plan. He works \novertime when he can and does not spend his money frivolously. I find all of the above \nmitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant experienced financial \nproblems when he was underemployed and unemployed. Two of his debt obligations \nbecame delinquent. He contacted a debt consolidation company and set up a plan to \nresolve the debts. He has settled one debt and is saving through his plan to resolve the \nother debt.

Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nOn July 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines. (AG)\nDOHA received Applicant\u2019s SOR answer on August 24, 2009. She admitted SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.b through 1.f, 1.m, 1.o through 1.p, 1.s, and 1.v. She denied the\nApril 28, 2010\n\nThe record contains no evidence of whether Department Counsel requested a hearing or whether Applicant\n1\nchanged her mind and opted for a hearing.\nApplicant was out of work for approximately eight months.\n2\n2\nremainder, and requested an administrative determination. On August 31, 2009, DOHA\nreceived Applicant\u2019s supplemental answer withdrawing her admission of SOR\nsubparagraph 1.v. The case was assigned to me on November 3, 2009.  On December\n1\n9, 2009, a notice of hearing was issued scheduling the case for January 12, 2010. At\nthe hearing, I received four Government exhibits, eight Applicant exhibits, and the\ntestimony of two witnesses. At the close of the hearing, Applicant moved to keep the\nrecord open to enable her to submit additional documents. Department Counsel did not\nobject and I granted the motion. Within the time allotted, Applicant submitted seven\nadditional exhibits that I admitted. DOHA received the transcript on January 19, 2010.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 26-year-old single woman with one child, age nine. She has a high\nschool education, and she is currently pursuing an associate\u2019s degree in computer\ninformation systems. (Tr. 27) \nApplicant works for a defense contractor as a security guard. She has worked for\nthe same company since October 2008. (Tr. 28) According to her supervisor, she is \u201ca\nmodel employee, who is always on time, and has always conducted herself in a highly\nprofessional manner.\u201d (GE 2 at 22)\nThe SOR lists 26 debts totalling approximately $34,000. Approximately $28,000\nof the debt consist of delinquent rental payments (SOR subparagraphs 1.a and 1.e),\nand the deficiencies from two automobile repossessions. (SOR subparagraphs 1.d and\n1.o) \nApplicant accrued the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.a in 2003 after she put\n\u201cher name on the lease with [a friend] to help him get an apartment,\u201d and the friend\nfailed to pay the rent. (Tr. 48) Subsequently, the court entered a judgment against\nApplicant for $3,705. By November 2009, Applicant had satisfied it through a wage\ngarnishment. (AE G)\nApplicant accrued the other rental delinquency, as listed in SOR subparagraph\n1.e, under similar circumstances as she accrued the rental delinquency as listed in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.a. Specifically, she signed a lease for her father to help him qualify for\nan apartment, and he subsequently failed to make the monthly rental payments. (Tr. 31)\nShe owes the landlord $1,620. (Answer at 1) She has not made any arrangements to\nsatisfy this delinquency. \nApplicant\u2019s first car repossession, as listed in SOR subparagraph 1.d, occurred in\n2003 after she lost her job  and could not make the monthly car payments. (Tr. 31) She\n2\n\nSOR subparagraph 1.v is a duplicate of SOR subparagraph 1.b.\n3\n3\nowes a deficiency of $12,768. (Answer at 1) She has not yet made plans to settle this\naccount. (Tr. 31)\nThe other repossession, as listed in SOR subparagraph 1.o, occurred in 2006.\n(Tr. 35, 80) Applicant owes a $9,395 deficiency. Currently, she has no plans to satisfy\nthis deficiency. (Tr. 80)\nApproximately $4,400 of Applicant\u2019s delinquencies consist of a department store\naccount (SOR subparagraph 1.f), four phone bills (SOR subparagraphs 1.m, 1.r, 1.s,\nand 1.z), and a student loan. (SOR subparagraph 1.p)\nApplicant accrued the department store account, in the amount of $911, before\nshe lost her job in 2003. (Tr. 32) She calls the creditor \u201cevery couple of months to . . .\nupdate . . .  [her] situation.\u201d (Tr. 66) Approximately three months ago, she promised to\narrange a payment plan once the garnishment related to SOR subparagraph 1.a was\ncompleted. (Tr. 66) The garnishment was completed in November 2009, but Applicant\nhas not yet contacted the department store creditor. (Tr. 66)\nApplicant satisfied the phone bill totalling $255 listed in SOR subparagraph 1.m.\n(AE A) The remaining delinquent phone accounts total approximately $1,122. She\naccrued the phone bill listed in SOR subparagraph 1.r, in the amount of $658, after she\nlost her job in 2003. (Tr. 38) Applicant\u2019s last contact with this creditor was in July 2009.\n(Tr. 85) She has no current plan to repay the debt. (Id.) She has no current plans to\nsatisfy the phone bills listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.s and 1.z, either. (Tr. 89) She\nintends to arrange plans \u201cin the near future.\u201d (Tr. 89)\nApplicant obtained the student loan listed in SOR subparagraph 1.p, when she\nfirst enrolled in college in 2005. (Tr. 35) While enrolled, the loan was in deferment. (Tr.\n36) After relocating to another state and transferring schools, the loan\u2019s deferment\nstatus lapsed, and became due. (GE 1 at 9-10; Tr. 36) On March 1, 2010, Applicant\nfiled a deferment request, which is pending approval. (AE O) Currently, approximately\n$1,858 is outstanding.\nWith the help of a credit counselor whom Applicant retained in April 2009, she\ndisputed the remainder of the SOR debts. (GE 2 at 20; AE J) Nine of the disputed debts\nare medical accounts (SOR subparagraphs 1.b,  1.g - 1.j, 1.l, 1.t, 1.x, and 1.y), and four\n3\ninclude a creditor whom Applicant did not recognize (SOR subparagraph 1.k - $69), a\nutility bill (SOR subparagraph 1.n - $181), a public library account (SOR subparagraph\n1.u - $64), and a bill allegedly owed to an insurance company. (SOR subparagraph 1.w\n- $168)\nThe disputed medical accounts total approximately $1,200. Applicant contends\nthat she never accrued these bills, and that they may have been accrued by her mother.\nTheir names are similar. (Tr. 78) \n\n4\nAfter an investigation, the credit reporting agency rejected Applicant\u2019s dispute of\nSOR subparagraph 1.b. (Tr. 53) She plans on paying it. Applicant\u2019s dispute of SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.g through 1.j, 1.i, 1.l, 1.w, and 1.y was successful, as they were\ndeleted from her credit report. (AE D) Applicant\u2019s dispute of the remaining medical\naccounts is pending. (Tr. 34, 39, 40)\nThe Government\u2019s evidence supporting its contention that Applicant is indebted\nto the creditor listed in SOR subparagraph 1.k is a credit report entry, which states that\nthe \u201cconsumer disputes this information.\u201d (GE 4 at 8) Applicant opened the utility bill\naccount listed in SOR subparagraph 1.n for her father. (Tr. 35) Her dispute is still\npending. (Tr. 35) SOR subparagraph 1.u is for overdue library books. (Tr. 107) This\naccount belongs to her mother. (Tr. 108 - Mother\u2019s Testimony)\nApplicant lives with her parents. (Tr. 91) She is currently not working pending the\noutcome of this security clearance decision. (Tr. 93) When she last worked, in\nDecember 2009, she earned approximately $842 in after-expense, monthly income. (AE\nH; Tr. 90-94)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied together with the factors\nlisted in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\n(AG \u00b6 18)  The Government relies upon the inclusion of the debt listed in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.k in a 2008 credit report to support its contention that it is delinquent.\nHowever, the credit report characterizes the debt as disputed. This evidence fails to\nestablish that Applicant is responsible for the debt. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14) I resolve SOR\nsubparagraph 1.k in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nConversely, the Government\u2019s evidence, together with Applicant\u2019s admissions\nestablish the remainder of the debts. Consequently, I conclude Applicant has a history\nof financial delinquencies that trigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant satisfied the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.a., and successfully\ndisputed the debts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.g through 1.i, 1.l, 1.w, and 1.y. I\nresolve these in her favor. Applicant established that the debt listed in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.u was not hers, through her mother\u2019s testimony. I resolve SOR\nsubparagraph 1.u in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nAlthough the credit reporting agency rejected Applicant\u2019s dispute of SOR\nsubparagraph 1.b, and the remainder of Applicant\u2019s disputed debts are still under\ninvestigation, the detailed, organized nature of the dispute process she developed is\nsufficient to trigger AG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the\nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d\nApplicant attributes much of her financial problems to a lengthy unemployment in\n2003. Irresponsibility, however, was equally, if not a more significant factor, as Applicant\nrepeatedly opened accounts for other people who then defaulted. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances,\u201d does not apply.\nAlthough Applicant retained a credit counselor, her focus appears to be\nexclusively on disputing debts. The substantial majority of Applicant\u2019s delinquencies are\nnot in dispute, and remain unaddressed. Consequently, AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(c), \u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem . . .,\u201d and 29(d), \u201cthe individual\n\n6\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d only\napply partially. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant is an exceptional employee. She deserves credit for consulting a credit\ncounselor to assist her with disputing several bills. However, the only significant bill that\nshe satisfied was through a wage garnishment. Approximately $25,000 of delinquent\ndebt remains outstanding, and she has no concrete plan to resolve it. Upon considering\nApplicant\u2019s case in the context of the whole-person concept, I conclude that her\napplication for a security clearance must be denied.\nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot\nor will not attain the state of financial rehabilitation necessary to mitigate the financial\nconsideration security concern. Should Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply\nfor a security clearance in the future, she may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of\nsecurity worthiness.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b - 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.g - 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.k - 1.m:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nSubparagraphs 1.n - 1.t:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.v:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.w:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.x:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.y:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.z:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn June 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued\nafter September 1, 2006.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 17, 2009, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on September 15, 2009, and was scheduled for hearing\non December 9, 2009.  A hearing was held on the scheduled date. At the hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of nine exhibits (exs. 1-9); Applicant relied on one witness\nFebruary 18, 2010\n\n2\n(himself) and no exhibits.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on December 17, 2009.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess classified information is granted.\nProcedural Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\nafford him the opportunity to supplement the record with documented medical payments,\nendorsements, and performance evaluations.  For good cause shown, Applicant was\ngranted ten days to supplement the record.  Within the time permitted, Applicant\nsupplemented the record with a cover letter explaining his enclosures and documented\nendorsements from his supervisors, medical payments and invoices related to his wife\u2019s\nmedical services and medications, and a certificate of completion of security training.\nApplicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted as exhibits A through D.   \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have incurred 11 delinquent debts\ntotaling about $12,000.  In his answer, he admitted most of the listed debts, but denied\nothers without any explanations. \n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 65-year-old security guard for a defense contractor seeking a\nsecurity clearance.

He\nchanged professions following an accident, and worked in the building trades for many\nyears as an in-house painter (Tr. 35-36).  During this time, he and his wife did not\nencounter any problems with their finances (Tr. 39).  His finances turned for the worse,\nhowever, after he was injured in a work-related accident in 2005.  As the result of his\naccident, he suffered herniated discs in his back, and could not work for over three years\n(see ex. 2; Tr. 28, 38). With his wife also disabled and unable to work, Applicant and his\nspouse struggled to keep up with their bills (Tr. 28).  Fearful of losing his job, he declined\nto seek workman\u2019s compensation benefits (Tr. 41).  By the time he quit his job in 2005,\nand relocated with his wife to their current state of residence, the time had expired for his\nfiling workman\u2019s compensation claims.\n\n3\nAt age 62 with a permanent disability, Applicant was eligible for early social\nsecurity benefits (Tr. 39-40).  So, he determined to quit his job and begin collecting his\nsocial security retirement benefits.  While out of work, Applicant accumulated a number\nof delinquent debts that he has not been able to pay or otherwise resolve.\n Credit reports in evidence document each of the debts listed in the SOR to be\ndebts that Applicant incurred either  separately, or jointly (see exs. six through nine).\nWhile he could identify some of the listed debts (e.g., creditors 1.b through 1.e and\ncreditor 1.j), he could not identify others (e.g., creditor 1.a, creditor 1.f through creditor 1.i\nand creditor 1.k). However, he could provide no documented proof of his disputes with\nany of these creditors, and did not provide any specific explanations of the bases of his\ndenying responsibility for any of these listed debts. Based on the information compiled in\nhis credit reports, there is enough data to draw reasonable inferences that these listed\ndebts belong to Applicant.\nApplicant\u2019s wife provided financial help while she worked.  But since her 1983\nauto accident, she has not been able to work (Tr. 28).  She was taking their kids to\nschool at the time, and was struck by another driver who had no insurance, and left the\nscene of the accident without providing identifying information (Tr. 45-46, 67). His wife\nhad only minimum insurance at the time and no known uninsured motorist coverage (Tr.\n59-60).  His wife\u2019s own insurance company paid her $25,000 out of her medical policy to\ncover her billed medical expenses (Tr. 59-62). With part of these monies, she paid her\nlawyer\u2019s fees, and as a result, she did not have enough in reserve to discharge all of her\noutstanding medical bills associated with her three corrective surgical procedures (Tr.\n47, 58-59).  \nTo conserve money following his own accident, Applicant and his wife moved in\nwith his sister-in-law in 2005 (Tr. 44).  In 2007, he and his wife left his sister-in-law\u2019s\nhouse and moved into a small duplex apartment for $1,200 a month (see ex. A).  His\nmonthly income at the time consisted of his retirement ($1,100), his wife\u2019s disability\npayments ($415), and whatever he could earn from small painting jobs (ex. A). After\nallowances for his rent payments, car insurance, utilities, food, and their medical bills,\nApplicant and his wife could not make ends meet (ex. A).  His monthly income stream\nremained virtually unchanged until he was hired by his current employer in July 2008\n(see exs. 1 and A). \nMore recently, Applicant\u2019s wife developed a debilitating disorder known as fibro-\nmyalgia: a trauma-related condition that is very painful (Tr. 49).  It affects her nerves and\nmuscles (Tr. 31-32, 49). She has had additional surgeries to address her condition.\nWhile she has enjoyed positive outcomes from these surgeries, her other organs have\ndeteriorated due to the disease (Tr. 49-50). His wife is still a very sick woman who\nrequires continuing medical care to address her weekly emergencies (Tr. 50-51). Her\ninsurance co-pays cost with her medical insurance cost Applicant $300 to $400 a week\n(Tr. 51-52). \nWhile employed full time, Applicant could cover his wife\u2019s medical bills and other\ncurrent expenses.  He could not while he was out of work.  He returned to work on a full-\n\n4\ntime basis with his current firm in July 2008, and worked for them for about a year before\nhis firm lost the contract that funded his employment (Tr. 30).  While employed on a full-\ntime basis, he was able to cover his current expenses, and make some payments on his\ndelinquent debts (see ex. 4; Tr. 55). Just how much he was able to pay on his old debts\nis not documented.\nOnce Applicant lost his full-time position with his current firm, he has continued to\nwork for them on a limited part-time basis, pending his obtaining of a security clearance\n(Tr. 30-31, 53-54).  His employer does cover his wife\u2019s medical expenses, and he needs\na security clearance to become a full-time employee again (Tr. 71-74). Applicant\u2019s\nsupervisor assures he has a full-time position for him should he obtain his security\nclearance (Tr. 31, 74).  With a full-time position, Applicant believes he will be in a\nposition to resume his payments on his bills (Tr. 31, 55).\nWith his disability payments and part time employment, Applicant is able to take\ncare of his household expenses and his wife\u2019s co-payments, but no more.  His personal\nfinancial statement of April 2009 lists combined monthly income of $3,040 and total\nmonthly expenses of $2,927 (see ex. 4). He listed scheduled debt payments (some SOR\ndebts, and some not) of $913, and actual payments of only $313. To make his scheduled\ndebt payments would place him in a deficit situation. His situation has not changed much\nto date, and he and his wife remain unable to address their old debts with their limited\nfunds (Tr. 57-58).\nApplicant has contacted a number of his creditors and offered to make $25 a\nmonth payments while he was disabled and unable to engage in full-time employment\n(Tr. 45).  His largest creditor (creditor 1.c) declined Appellant\u2019s offer.  It then initiated suit\nto collect its $4,130 balance and obtained a judgment against Applicant (Tr. 29-30). To\npay for his rent and necessities, he and his wife sold their wedding rings and moved their\nfamily into his son\u2019s home (Tr. 29). To meet his medical premiums and pay down his\ndebts, Applicant needs full-time employment.  \nApplicant is well regarded by his supervisor and other members of his facility  (see\nexs. A and B; Tr. 71-76). His direct supervisor describes Applicant as an outstanding\nsecurity guard who displays excellent judgment and trustworthiness (Tr. 74-76). He\nconsiders Applicant to be a responsible employee who is an asset to his company.\nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of\nthe \"[c]onditions that could mitigate security concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be\nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place\n\n5\nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nguidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the\ncontext of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c) \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be\nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy concerns are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. AG \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nUnder the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for\nsecurity clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires administrative\njudges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record,\nthe ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in\nlarge part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversarial\nproceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and\n\n6\nlogical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the judge cannot draw factual\ninferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR; and (2) it must demonstrate that the\nfacts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or his security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.  Because Executive Order 10865 requires that all\nsecurity clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a respected employee of a defense contractor who accumulated\ndelinquent debts during his extended periods of recurrent disabilities of both himself and\nhis wife.   Because of his own physical limitations and disabilities of his spouse, he has\nbeen unable to address any of his debts. \nApplicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts over a four-year period warrant the\napplication of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration\nguideline: DC \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and DC \u00b619(c) \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  Without any documented payment or\ndispute history, or tangible plan to resolve his delinquent debts, he cannot  be credited\nwith any more than minimal  progress to date in regaining control of his finances.\nApplicant\u2019s progress to date in regaining control of his finances is not\nencouraging. Based on his evidentiary showing, his proofs do reflect considerable\nextenuating circumstances associated with his wife\u2019s disabilities and his own.  As a\nresult, MC  \u00b6 20(b) of the financial considerations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation,\nand the individual acted responsibly),\u201d has application to Applicant\u2019s circumstances. \nApplicant has not been in a position to even address all of his non-SOR covered\ndebts, much less any of listed debts with the part-time job he has with his current\nemployer. He could provide no documented disputes of any of the listed debts or\nestimates of when he could begin to address his delinquent debt with the limited funds\nhe receives from his retirement and part-time employment as a security guard.  As a\n\n7\nresult, he is not positioned to take advantage of either MC \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,\u201d or MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d \nBecause he has not been able to provide any repayment plan or evidence of\nfinancial counseling to date, he may not invoke any of the mitigating benefits of MC \u00b6\n20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d or MC  \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  \nIn the past, the Appeal Board has not required an applicant to demonstrate he is\ndebt-free or has a plan to pay off all of his debts See ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App\nBd. Oct. 29, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2009). All that is\nrequired of an applicant is that he act responsibly under the circumstances and develop\na reasonable plan for repayment.  The strength of the applicant\u2019s repayment plan must\nbe proportionate to what can be reasonably determined that the \u201cApplicant could or\nshould have done under the circumstances that he has not already done to rectify his\npoor financial condition, or why the approach taken by Applicant was not \u201cresponsible\u201d in\nlight of his limited circumstances.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3. \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, he has sufficiently demonstrated his good credit history before\nhis 2005 accident and why he and his wife have fallen behind in their debts and have not\nbeen able to repay them with their limited resources. He assures he will resume\nrepayments of his delinquent debts as soon as his company restores him to full-time\nstatus. Currently, the only impediment to his being granted a full-time position is his lack\nof a security clearance.  And his supervisor has committed to restoring Applicant to full\ntime employment status once he obtains a clearance.\nAlthough applicants are expected to address their debts and develop reasonable\nrepayment plans after they have returned to work and are in a position to repay their\nfinancial obligations, Applicant has yet to recover from the circumstances that prevented\nhim from finding full-time employment. As he awaits notification of the status of his\nsecurity clearance, he is limited to part-time work with his employer. Until he is able to\nreturn to work on a full-time basis, he is simply not in a position to develop a reasonable\nrepayment plan. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004).  \nHolding a security clearance involves a fiduciary relationship between the\nGovernment and the clearance holder. Quite apart from any agreement the clearance\nholder may have signed with the Government, the nature of the clearance holder\u2019s duties\nand access to classified information necessarily impose important duties of trust and\ncandor on the clearance holder that are considerably higher than those typically imposed\non government employees and contractors involved in other lines of government\nbusiness.  See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980). \n\n1      The Government, of course, can always re-validate Applicant\u2019s financial status at any time through credit\nreports, investigation, and additional interrogatories.  Approval of a clearance now does not bar the\nGovernment from subsequently revoking it, if warranted.  Violation of a promise made in a security context\nto pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future revocation\nof a security clearance.  Conditional clearances are not permitted under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence,\nand nothing in this decision is intended to suggest that this clearance is in any way conditional.  See ISCR\nCase No. 08-07540 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 8, 2010).\n8\nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance. While the\nprincipal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are explicit in\nfinancial cases.  Failure of an applicant to make concerted efforts to pay or resolve his\ndebts when able to do, or develop a reasonable repayment plan, raises security-\nsignificant concerns about the sufficiency of an applicant\u2019s demonstrated trust and\njudgment necessary to safeguard classified information. Applicant is simply not in a\nposition to do any more at this time than fund his living expenses and take care of his\nwife\u2019s monthly cost-shares under his company-provided insurance plan.  \nWhole-person assessment enables Applicant to surmount the trust and judgment\nquestions raised by his lack of any documented repayment efforts and repayment plan.\nHis positive endorsements from his supervisors merit considerable praise and\ncommendation. Based on his credible showing of his caring for his sick wife and still\nmaintaining responsible control of his own finances, Applicant convinces that he develop\na reasonable repayment plan for his remaining delinquent debts once he is able to\nregain his full time work status with his current employer.1\nFamily disabilities, unemployment, and underemployment conditions have clearly\nplayed a major contributing role in Applicant\u2019s accumulation of his delinquent debts over\nan extended period. He provided a considerable amount of documentation of his medical\nstatements and payment receipts covering his wife\u2019s medical needs, which he has\ndiligently prioritized. He has also provided documented explanations of how he plans to\nrepay his debts with his obtaining a full-time guard position with his present employer.\nHis strong endorsements and family commitments are helpful, too, in making a\ndetermination of his overall trustworthiness and reliability under both the financial\nguideline and a whole-person assessment.\n Based on Applicant\u2019s showing of longstanding extenuating circumstances\nassociated with the disabilities of himself and his wife, his payment record when he was\nable to work full time in his chosen field, and his reasonable payment plan conditioned\nupon his return to full time employment,  the evidence is sufficient to enable Applicant to\nestablish judgment and trust levels adequate to overcome security concerns arising out\nof his lack of progress in addressing his delinquent debts over the past four years.\nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, the limited resources he has had to address them, and\nthe modest steps he has mounted to address his old debts, there is sufficient evidence of\nhis good character, diligence, honesty, and conscientious efforts in managing his\n\n9\nfinances on his limited income to make safe predictive judgments about his ability to\nrepay his accrued debts and restore his finances to stable levels commensurate with his\nholding a security clearance. Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.k.\nIn reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a\nwhole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs.\nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):       FOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.k:\n          For Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. \nClearance is granted.\n                                  \nRoger C.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the Department of Defense on September 1, \n2006.

Applicant's monthly net pay is $2,800 \nand his wife's monthly net pay is $1,600, for a combined family income of $4,400. Their \nrecurring monthly expenses are $4,000, leaving $400 monthly in discretionary or \ndisposable income. Applicant's student loans are paid, and he and his wife are current \nwith their taxes. (Tr. 43-44) \n  \nCredit reports (Gov. Ex. 6, Credit report, dated August 21, 2001; Gov. Ex. 7, \nCredit report, dated May 3, 2007; and Gov. Ex. 8, Credit report, dated August 7, 2009) \nshow the following delinquent debts for Applicant: child support arrears in the amount of \n$4,917 (SOR 1.a); a telephone debt in collection for $1,625.74 (SOR 1.b); a debt for a \ncar repossession for $12,974 (SOR 1.c); a furniture account in collection for $2,450.05 \n(SOR 1.d); an apartment rent account in collection for $3,698 (SOR 1.e); another car \nrepossession debt for $4,382 (SOR 1.f); two medical accounts in collection for $228 \n(SOR 1.g), and $75 (SOR 1.h); an internet service debt for $257 (SOR 1.i); a returned \ncheck debt in collection for $240 (SOR 1.j); a cable debt in collection for $166 (SOR \n1.k); another medical account in collection for $50 (SOR 1.l); another telephone account \nin collection for $32 (SOR 1.m); and an account past due for $1,682 (SOR 1.n).  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.a is based on the garnishment of wages for \nmonthly child support payments of $336.05 and $4,917 in child support payment \narrears. Applicant's child support arrears have been paid and he is current with the child \nsupport payments. Applicant filed a petition to get custody of his son that is the subject \nof the child support. If custody is granted, Applicant's child support obligation will end. \n(Tr. 17-19; App. Ex. A, Family court Case History, dated December 18, 2009; App. Ex. \nD, Motion, Filed February 10. 2010) \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.b is for a family telephone debt. Applicant and his \nformer wife had the account from November 1999 until April 2005 at a military duty \nstation. When they separated, his wife used the phone service and incurred a significant \nphone bill that she did not pay it. Applicant tried to close the account but since they \nwere not divorced, the phone company would not close the account. Applicant was \nfinally able to close the account. In their divorce settlement, Applicant and his wife were \nto evenly split the marital debts. Applicant's wife has not paid her part of the marital \ndebts, to include the phone bill. The telephone company is seeking to collect the debt \nfrom Applicant. Applicant has not paid this debt. Applicant will pay the debt if he can \nreach a settlement with the creditor. (Tr. 26-27, 50-51)  \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.c is for a car Applicant purchased for his former \nwife that was repossessed. Applicant settled this account for $1,500 and the debt has \nbeen paid. (Tr. 27-29; App. Ex. E, Letter, dated March 25, 2010; App. Ex. G, Bank \nStatement, dated March 26, 2010) \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.d for $1,625.74, is for furniture Applicant and his \nformer wife purchased when he entered the military and was at his first duty station. The \nfurniture was eventually donated to help other military members in need of furniture. \nThe debt was settled for $232.65 and has been paid. (Tr. 20, 29-30; App. Ex. B, \nSettlement offer, dated February 6, 2010; App. Ex. G, Bank statement, dated March 26, \n2010 at 2) \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.e is for an apartment Applicant leased for about \nseven months but terminated early because of issues raised by his neighbors \nconcerning noise from his son. Applicant had problems with his neighbors and he and \nthe property manager agreed to the lease termination. There was even a walk-through \nof the apartment to note there was no damage before Applicant left. The monthly lease \nwas $700, and Applicant paid a $1,500 security deposit. When he moved, the property \nmanager did not return the security deposit. There is no explanation of the $3,698 \ncharge. Applicant is disputing this debt. (Tr. 30-36)  \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.f is for a car Applicant purchased in 1996 for \n$17,000. He made the monthly payments until June 2000 when the car was voluntarily \nreturned to the creditor. Applicant has not been in contact with the creditor on this debt. \nHe plans to contact the creditor and reach a settlement as soon as he has sufficient \nfunds to pay a settlement. (Tr. 36-39, 50-51) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe delinquent debts at SOR 1.g, 1.h, and 1.l are medical debts to unspecified \ncreditors. Applicant attempted but has been unable to learn the names of the creditors \nor the specific nature of the debts. He has not made payments on the debts because of \nthe lack of information. He disputed the debts with the credit reporting agencies. (Tr. 39-\n40; App. Ex. F, Letter, dated March 24, 2010)  \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.i for $257 is for a telephone debt. The account was \npaid in February 2002. The creditor verified that the account was closed. (Tr. 40-41, \nApp. Ex. E, Applicant's Letter, dated March 25, 2010) \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.j is for a check returned for insufficient funds. \nWhile on active duty, Applicant had the requirement to arrange a dinner event for \nmembers of his unit and their spouses. Each unit member was to pay for their meals. At \nthe end of the evening, the restaurant owner informed Applicant that not all of the \nparticipants paid for their meals. Applicant provided him a check for $50 to cover the \nunpaid bill. The check did not clear the bank. With fees and charges, the debt is now for \n$240. Applicant is willing to pay the debt. He contacted the creditor and collection \nagencies in an attempt to pay the debt. However, no one has any information on the \naccount. He disputed the debt with the credit reporting agency since there is no \ninformation on which to pay the debt. (Tr. 41-42; App. Ex. F, Letter, dated March 24, \n2010) \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.k is a cable service debt his former wife was to \npay. Applicant paid the debt in full. (Tr. 42; App. Ex. E, Applicant's Letter, dated March \n25, 2010; App. Ex. G, Bank Statement, dated March 26, 2010) \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.m is for a telephone debt of $32. Applicant \ncontacted the creditor and collection agency, but they were unable to find any debt \nowed by Applicant. Applicant disputed the debt with the credit reporting agency. (Tr. 42, \nApp. Ex. F, Applicant's Letter, dated March 24, 2010)  \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.n is for a loan. The debt has been paid in full. (Tr. \n20; App. Ex. C, Statement, dated March 4, 2010) \n \nApplicant's watch commander has known Applicant for over six years. Applicant's \nduty performance is professional and exemplary. Applicant is an asset to the \norganization and has been exceptional as the security supervisor. He recommends that \nApplicant be granted access to classified information. (App. Ex. H, Letter, undated) \nAnother supervisor notes that he has known Applicant since 2004. Applicant has been \nprofessional, responsible, and conscientious. He recommends that Applicant be granted \naccess to classified information. (App. Ex. I, Letter, dated March 11, 2010)  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \n\n \n5 \n \n \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations: \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds \n(AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \n\n \n6 \n \n \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified \ninformation. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an \nindication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations. The delinquent debts listed in credit reports as well as admitted by Applicant \nare a security concern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \n\u00b6 AG 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history \nof not meeting financial obligations). Applicant incurred delinquent debt as a young \nmarried military member. He and his first wife had delinquent debt as Applicant started \nin the military. His former wife also incurred some debt after they separated without his \nknowledge. His former wife did not pay some of the debts the decree required her to \npay.  \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) \n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances). These mitigating conditions partially apply. Applicant's \nfinancial problems started as a young married member of the military with a family to \nsupport. Most of his debts were for cars and furniture that he purchased for his family. \nThese debts were incurred in the normal course of life and financial activities. There \nwere no unusual circumstances beyond Applicant's control that led to the debts. \nHowever, some of the debts were incurred by Applicant's former wife without his \nknowledge. These debts were beyond his control. Applicant has paid some of the debts, \ncontacted creditors as to other debts, and has plans to pay his remaining delinquent \ndebts. He is acting responsibly toward his debts.  \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay. A systematic method of handling debts is needed. Applicant \nmust establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment. A \"meaningful track record\" \nof debt payment can be established by evidence of actual debt payments or reduction of \ndebt through payment of debts. An applicant is not required to establish that he paid \neach and every debt listed. The entirety of an Applicant\u2019s financial situation and his \nactions can reasonably be considered in evaluating the extent to which that Applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination. There is no requirement \nthat a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts \none at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. All that is required \nis that Applicant demonstrate he has established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.   \n \nApplicant has paid five of his 14 delinquent debts. He is current with his child \nsupport payments. He is contacting the creditors to establish payment plans on two of \nhis other debts. He has disputed six of the debts. Applicant's actions paying and \ndisputing his delinquent debts are significant and credible information to establish a \nmeaning track record of debt payment, and shows that he acted reasonably under the \ncircumstances.  \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provided \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of action \nto resolve he issue). Applicant provided documentation of his dispute with six of the \ndelinquent debts. He has no knowledge of the debts, and the creditors cannot provide \nhim information on the accounts.  \n \nUnder the circumstances, Applicant has acted responsibly towards his debts and \nfinances. Applicant presented sufficient information to mitigate security concerns for \nfinancial considerations by establishing that he has or is paying his delinquent debts, \nand is actively disputing some of his debts. His finances do not indicate a security \nconcern.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access to \nclassified information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant's over 13 \nyears of active and reserve service in the Air Force, and his honorable discharge. I \nconsidered that Applicant has a reputation with his supervisors for professionalism, \ndedication, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \n \n \nApplicant established a meaningful track record of debt payment of his \ndelinquent debts. He has or is paying six of his debts, and actively disputed another six \nfor which information is not available. He is contacting creditors to settle and pay his two \nremaining debts. Applicant established that he acted reasonably and responsibly \ntowards his finances indicating he will act reasonably and responsibly to protect \nclassified information. The management of his finances indicates he will be concerned, \nresponsible, and not careless concerning classified information. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for access to classified information. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial situation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.n:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: B. Daniel Lynch, Esquire\nAugust 24, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn August 21, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline B  for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn September 16, 2009, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and he\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nDecember 1, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 2, 2010, and I convened\nthe hearing as scheduled on March 17, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits 1\nthrough 5, which were received and admitted without objection after Exhibit 1 was\nredacted. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A and B, at the\ntime of hearing, which were also admitted without objection. Seven additional witnesses\nalso testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on\n\n2\nMarch 25, 2010. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until April 7,\n2010, to submit additional documents, and Department Counsel had until April 14,\n2010, to indicate whether or not he had any objections to the documents that Applicant\nsubmitted. Applicant timely submitted one additional document, which has been\nidentified and entered into evidence as Exhibit C. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and the testimony of Applicant and the other witnesses, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts\nrelating to the country of Jordan. The request and the attached documents were\nadmitted into evidence as Exhibit 5 . The facts administratively noticed are set out in the\nFindings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted that all of the SOR allegations 1.a. through 1.g.,\nare correct. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant and his\nfather, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 51 years old. He has been married since 1991. His wife was born in\nKuwait as a Jordanian, and she became a United States citizen in 1997. Applicant and\nhis wife have four children, and they are all United States born citizens.  Applicant is\nemployed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in\nconnection with his employment in the defense sector.\nApplicant was born in 1958 in the West Bank, which at that time was under the\ncontrol of Jordan. It is currently under Israel\u2019s control. He lived there until approximately\n1977. He moved to Kuwait for a brief period, and then he moved to England, where he\nlived from 1977 to 1979. He attended college in England. In 1979 and 1980, he\nattended an American college in Spain. In 1981, he emigrated to the United States to\nattend college here, and he has lived in the United States since then. In 1989, he\nreceived a Bachelor of Science degree in Electronics, and in 1991 he became a United\nStates citizen. He has been employed for several different companies, but since 1994,\nhe has worked as a technician at an Air Force base for different contractors, within the\nsame communications squadron. He estimated his assets in the United States at\n$125,000.\n\n3\n(Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nThe SOR lists seven allegations, regarding Foreign Influence, under Adjudicative\nGuideline B, which will be reviewed in the same order as they were listed on the SOR.\nAs stated above, Applicant has admitted all of the allegations listed:\n \n1.a. Applicant's mother is a citizen of Jordan and resident of Israel. Applicant is\nclose to his mother and has visited her on several occasions, as reviewed in 1.g.,\nbelow. His last visit was to see her as she is extremely ill, on 24 hour oxygen support.\nHis mother once came to visit Applicant in the United States, but then she returned to\nIsrael. (Tr at 138.)\n1.b. Applicant has a brother, who is a citizen and resident of Jordan. Applicant\ntestified that he calls his siblings \u201coccasionally during holidays for a very short time,\nmaybe two or three minutes at most.\u201d (Tr at 117.) None of his siblings is currently\nemployed by any government entity or has been in the past. (Tr at 138.) None of his\nsiblings has ever come to visit him in the United States. \n1.c. Applicant has a brother, who is a citizen of Jordan and resident of United\nArab Emirates. As stated above, none of Applicant\u2019s siblings is currently employed by\nany government entity or has been in the past. (Tr at 138.) \n1.d. Applicant has two other brothers, who are citizens of Jordan and residents of\nIsrael. Again, none of Applicant\u2019s siblings is currently employed by any government\nentity or has been in the past. (Tr at 138.) \n1.e. Applicant has five sisters, who are citizens of Jordan and residents of Israel.\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that one of his sisters has moved to Canada, but the\nothers still reside in Israel. (Tr at 124.) Again, none of Applicant\u2019s siblings is currently\nemployed by any government entity or has been in the past. (Tr at 138.) \n1.f. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Jordan. Applicant has\nvery little contact with her. \n1.g. Applicant has traveled to Jordan and/or Israel in at least 1994, 1997, 1999,\nand 2008. All of his trips were to visit his mother, and they each were between three\nand six weeks in duration. (Tr at 105-106.) He has always used his United States\npassport when visiting any other country. (Tr at 111.) Applicant had a Jordanian\npassport, but he sent it to his employer\u2019s security officer, who tore it and rendered it\nunusable. Applicant submitted a letter from his security officer confirming this. (Exhibit\n4.) \nApplicant\u2019s mother has owned some property in Israel, but Applicant indicated\nthat he has renounced any claim to it, and it has been divided among his siblings. He\nhas no interest in any property outside of the United States. (Tr at 107-110.)\n\n4\nAt the hearing, Applicant indicated he would be willing to renounce his Jordanian\ncitizenship, and the record was left open to allow Applicant the opportunity to renounce\nhis Jordanian citizenship. Applicant, through his counsel, submitted a post hearing\ndocument, which included the instructions for a Jordanian citizen to renounce his\ncitizenship. (Exhibit C.)  Applicant\u2019s attorney indicated that Applicant was not able to\nrenounce his citizenship because he did not meet certain criteria. These included the\nfact that Applicant did not have a passport to return, because the Security Officer had\ndestroyed it, Applicant has never had a family identification card, and Applicant never\nserved in the Jordanian military, nor could he prove he was unavailable for military\nservice during the times he was eligible for military service. So while Applicant had the\nwill to renounce his Jordanian citizenship, he was unable to actually do it. \n Mitigation\nAs stated above, seven witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. They all were\nextremely laudatory in describing Applicant. He was described as a \u201cgo to guy with good\nmoral character\u201d who is \u201ctrustworthy and with good moral character.\u201d (Tr at 36-37.)\nAmong the other positive terms used to describe Applicant were \u201cvery dependable, very\nhonest, and a very upstanding character.\u201d (Tr at 61-63.)\nApplicant submitted 19 very positive character letters in Exhibit A, from\nindividuals who know and have known Applicant in a variety of employment situations.\nHe was described as a \u201csincere and hard working professional whose character and\nethical standards are without peer.\u201d Another letter stated that Applicant \u201chas strong\nfamily values, is very devout, honest, law abiding, trustworthy, well-educated, reliable,\nquiet & non aggressive.\u201d\nCurrent Status of Jordan\nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding Jordan. Jordan is a\nsmall country located in the Middle East with a constitutional monarchy. Jordan is ruled\nby King Abdullah II. It has followed a pro-western foreign policy and has had close\nrelations with the United States for six decades. Despite Jordan\u2019s aggressive pursuit of\nterrorists, the threat of terrorism remains high in Jordan. Terrorist organizations\ncurrently target the United States for intelligence collection through human espionage\nand by other means. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\n\n5\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding Foreign Influence: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\n\n6\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in\nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Those that could be applicable in this case include the following: AG \u00b6 7\n(a) \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion.\u201d Applicant\u2019s relatives, who are citizens and residents of Jordan or Israel, and\nwho continue to have, in the case of his mother, a very close bond to Applicant, make\nAG \u00b6 7(a) a concern to the Government. I find that AG \u00b6 7(b) \u201cconnections to a foreign\nperson, group government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between\nthe individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information  . . . and the individual\u2019s desire\nto help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information\u201d is also\napplicable in this case. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I find that AG \u00b6\n8(b) \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty or\nobligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest,\u201d is applicable to this Applicant and controlling for the following reasons:  \nApplicant is a U.S. citizen, who has lived in the U.S. since 1981 and been a\nUnited States citizen since 1991. Appellant\u2019s wife has been a U.S. citizen since 1997.\nThe four children of Applicant and his wife are solely U.S. citizens and residents.\nApplicant never served in the military of a foreign Government, and he has only been\nemployed in the United States. All of Applicant\u2019s assets are in the United States. Finally,\nApplicant had seven impressive individuals testify on his behalf as to his honesty and\ntrustworthiness. I therefore conclude Guideline B for Applicant.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n7\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case under Guideline B. Based on all of\nthe reasons cited above as to why the Mitigating Condition applies, and the very\nlaudatory descriptions of Applicant from the witnesses at the hearing and the writers of\nthe submitted letters, I find that the record evidence leaves me with no significant\nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance\nunder the whole-person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has\nmitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g.: For Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on August 1, 2008. On \nAugust 20, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines B and C. DOHA acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of \nDefense on September 1, 2006.  \n \nJune 22, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on August 27, 2009; answered it on August 31, \n2009; and requested an administrative determination on the record without a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on September 3, 2009. On \nJanuary 8, 2010, Applicant changed his mind and requested a hearing. Department \nCounsel was ready to proceed on February 12, 2010, and the case was assigned to me \non February 19, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 24, 2010, \nscheduling the hearing for March 25, 2010. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The \nGovernment withdrew the Guideline C allegations at the hearing. Government Exhibits \n(GX) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, presented \nthe testimony of five witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A and B, which \nwere admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 2, 2010. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout Iran. The request and the documents attached as enclosures were not admitted \nin evidence but are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. I took \nadministrative notice as requested by Department Counsel. (Tr. 20.) The facts \nadministratively noticed are set out below in my findings of fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. His \nadmissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old computer systems analyst for a federal contractor. He \nhas worked for his current employer since August 2007. He has never held a security \nclearance. He previously applied for a clearance with another agency, but his \napplication was denied because he had an active Iranian passport. (Tr. 47-48.) \n \n \nApplicant was born in Iran. He came to the United States in December 1978, \nwhen he was 19 years old. He was accompanied by his aunt. He received a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in industrial technology in 1986. (Tr. 36-39.) He became a U.S. citizen in \nJanuary 1992. (GX 1 at 7.) \n \nApplicant worked for another federal contractor from November 1998 until he \nwas hired by his current employer. He married a U.S. citizen in May 1983 and divorced \nher in January 1986. He married another U.S. citizen in October 1994. He has two \nchildren from his current marriage, ages 11 and 9. (GX 1 at 13-18; Tr. 48-49.) \n \n \nApplicant obtained an Iranian passport in April 1997 to visit his ailing father in \nIran. He visited his father for two weeks. His father passed away a few months later. His \nIranian passport expired in April 2007, and he has not renewed it.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are deceased. His only sibling is a sister who is a citizen and \nresident of Iran. He has telephonic contact with his sister about 12 times a year. (GX 2 \n\n \n3 \n \n \nat 3.) In September 2004, he filed a petition for his sister to immigrate to the United \nStates. His sister is a homemaker, married to an Iranian, and has one daughter. \nApplicant does not know what his sister\u2019s husband does for a living, but he knows her \nhusband is not connected to the Iranian government or military. (Tr. 55-56.) Applicant \nhas seen his sister for only two weeks in the last 31 years, when he went to Iran to visit \nhis dying father. His sister will be required to leave her family behind if she comes to the \nUnited States. (Tr. 59-60.) Applicant was notified in January 2010 that the U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Service had approved the petition. The notification does not \ngrant any immigration status and does not guarantee that his sister will be eligible for a \nvisa. (AX A.) \n \n \nApplicant has telephonic contact about once a year with the aunt who \naccompanied him to the United States in 1978. She is a retired university professor. A \nsecond aunt with whom he maintained contact recently passed away. (Tr. 61-63.)  \n \nApplicant has telephonic contact about five times a year with a cousin who is an \nIranian citizen but lives in Canada. He has telephonic contact about five times a year \nwith a nephew who is a citizen of Iran but lives in the United Kingdom. All his other \nrelatives (an uncle, his uncle\u2019s wife, and a cousin) are naturalized citizens and residents \nof the United States. (GX 2 at 3.) \n \n \nApplicant has no real estate or other assets in Iran. He owns a home in the \nUnited States worth about $700,000, a second home worth about $300,000, and a \nvacation time share worth about $7,000. He has retirement accounts worth $229,700, \npersonal property worth $50,000, and savings of $137,000. (AX B.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that his loyalty is to the United States, and that he has no \nloyalty to Iran. He is devoted to the United States, his spouse, and his children. (Tr. 31-\n32.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister-in-law has known him since he and her sister began dating in \nthe early 1990s. She described Applicant as a \u201cvery honorable, honest man.\u201d She \ntestified that Applicant would never to anything to hurt someone he cares about. If \nanyone tried to coerce Applicant, he would report the effort to the appropriate \nauthorities. (Tr. 73-75.) \n \n \nA coworker testified he does not regard Applicant as a security risk. The \ncoworker was not familiar with the SOR, but he is aware that Applicant has a sister and \nan elderly aunt in Iran, and that Applicant\u2019s family is close knit. (Tr. 79-80.) \n \n \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s close friends who have known him for 20 years testified that \nthey do not regard Applicant as a security risk. They are aware that Applicant has a \nsister in Iran and is sponsoring her for immigration to the United States. (Tr. 83-84, 87-\n89.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse testified that Applicant is a very devoted husband and father. \nHe is close to his sister in Iran, but they do not talk about his work, and his sister is \nunaware of his work. She testified that Applicant\u2019s life revolves around his spouse and \nchildren. She is confident that if anyone attempted to coerce him through his sister, he \nwould report it immediately. (Tr. 91-96.) \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice that Iran is a theocratic Islamic republic \ndominated by Shia Muslim clergy, with ultimate political authority vested in a learned \nreligious scholar. Current U.S. concerns about Iran are based on its efforts to acquire \nnuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction; support for and involvement in \ninternational terrorism; support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; \nand its human rights abuses, including summary executions, torture, arbitrary arrest and \ndetention, and restrictions on civil liberties. Iran has provided guidance, training, and \nweapons to Shia political and militant groups in Iraq. It also provides encouragement, \ntraining, funding, and weapons to anti-Israeli terrorist groups in its efforts to undermine \nthe Arab-Israeli peace process (HX I at 1-5). \n \nI also have taken administrative notice that the U.S. has designated Iran as a \nstate sponsor of terrorism. The U.S. broke diplomatic relations with Iran in April 1980, \nprohibits most trade with Iran, and uses multilateral sanctions and diplomatic pressure \nto contain the threats posed by Iran (HX I at 3).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n \n5 \n \n \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s sister, aunts, and cousins are citizens and residents \nof Iran (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b), and he traveled to Iran \u201cat least\u201d in July 1997 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The \nevidence establishes that Applicant has a sister and one elderly aunt living in Iran. He \nhas two cousins who are Iranian citizens, but one resides in Canada and the other in \nthe United Kingdom. All his other relatives are naturalized citizens and residents of the \nUnited States. He traveled to Iran in July 1997 for two weeks to visit his dying father, \nand has not returned to Iran since the death of his father. \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \n\n \n6 \n \n \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nTwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. First, a \ndisqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a). Second, a disqualifying \ncondition may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person . . . that create a potential \nconflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or \ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that \ninformation.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(b).  \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, \n2002). Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United \nStates, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the U.S.  \n \nIran\u2019s hostility to the United States places a \u201cvery heavy burden of persuasion\u201d on \nApplicant to demonstrate that his family members in Iran do not pose a security risk, \nand he is not in a position to be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States \nand his family members. See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) \n(stating an applicant has \u201ca very heavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security \nconcerns\u201d when parents and siblings live in Iran). See also ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at \n4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d standard when an applicant \nhas family members living in Iran). \n \n \nThe nature of Iran\u2019s government, its quest for sensitive information, its deplorable \nhuman rights record, and its hostility to the United States create the \u201cheightened risk\u201d \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncontemplated by AG \u00b6 7(a) and the \u201cpotential conflict of interest\u201d contemplated by AG \u00b6 \n7(b). Both disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence, shifting the burden to \nApplicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).  \n \n \nTwo mitigating conditions under this guideline are relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister and aunt are not connected to the Iran government. \nNevertheless, the nature of that government, its abuse of its citizens, and its hostility to \nthe United States preclude application of AG \u00b6 8(a).  \n \n \nThe application of AG \u00b6 8(b) is a closer question. Applicant undoubtedly has \nstrong ties to the United States, but his witnesses also testified that Applicant, his sister, \nand his aunt are members of a close-knit family. His aunt accompanied him to the U.S. \nin 1978. His sister-in-law testified he is the kind of person who would never do anything \nthat would hurt someone close to him.  \n \n \nApplicant testified that his loyalty is solely to the United States, his spouse, and \nhis children, and that he has no loyalty to Iran. His witnesses testified that he would \nresist and report attempts to coerce him. This testimony is of limited value, however, \n\u201cunless there is record evidence that the applicant has acted in a similar manner in the \npast in comparable circumstances, or that the applicant has a previous track record of \ncomplying with security regulations and procedures in the context of dangerous, high-\nrisk circumstances in which he made a significant contribution to the national security.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 19, 2008). Mindful of my obligation to \ndecide close questions in favor of national security, I conclude that AG \u00b6 8(b) is not \nestablished. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s one trip to Iran to visit his dying father in July 1997 has no \nindependent security significance. See ISCR Case No. 02-26978 (App. Bd. Sep 21, \n2005). Accordingly, I resolve SOR \u00b6 1.c in his favor. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nAt the beginning of the hearing, Department Counsel withdrew the Guideline C \nallegations. (Tr. 21.) Accordingly, I resolve all the allegations under Guideline C for \nApplicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult who has spent most of his adult life in the United \nStates. He is deeply devoted to his family and his love for the United States is \nunquestionable. He has pursued and attained the American dream. On the other hand, \nhe comes from a close-knit Iranian family. He has never been required to resolve the \nkind of conflict of interest that AG \u00b6 8(b) contemplates. It is unlikely that the conflict of \ninterest raised by his family ties to Iran will be resolved quickly. It took more than five \nyears for his sister\u2019s immigrant application to be approved, and there is no indication \nthat his sister will receive a visa in the near future.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence. Accordingly, I conclude \nhe has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C (Foreign Preference): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant (withdrawn) \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to retain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Applicant admitted subparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b. of the Statement of Reasons. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact. He denied subparagraph 1.a. He also submitted additional information in support of his request for a security clearance. Paragraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he has engaged in criminal conduct. Applicant and his wife were married in 2000. She is a law enforcement professional. By late 2007 they were having marital problems. In early 2008 Applicant moved out of the marital home, but visited his wife and children. In March 2008 the Applicant and his wife became engaged in an emotional and heated argument over their future. The Applicant, by his own admission, lost control of the situation and accidentally fired his wife\u2019s service weapon. He was not aiming the weapon at his wife or himself.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nSeptember 10, 2010\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86), on July 25,\n2006. (Government Exhibit 1.) He submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP), on September 16, 2008. (Government Exhibit 3.) On\nJuly 13, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines J (Criminal\nConduct), and F (Financial Considerations) concerning Applicant. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered (Answer) the SOR in writing on August 3, 2009, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was\nprepared to proceed on September 17, 2009. This case was assigned to me on\nSeptember 24, 2009.  DOHA issued the notice of hearing on September 28, 2009, and I\n\n2\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on October 30, 2009. The Government offered\nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 11, which were received without objection. Applicant\ntestified on his own behalf, called one additional witness, and submitted Applicant\nExhibit A, which was also received without objection. Applicant requested time to submit\nadditional evidence and, on November 23, 2009, submitted Applicant Exhibit B, which\nwas received without objection. DOHA received the final transcript of the hearing on\nNovember 16, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 26, separated from his wife, and has two children.  He is\nemployed by a defense contractor and seeks to retain a security clearance in\nconnection with his employment. Applicant admitted subparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b. of the\nStatement of Reasons. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact. He\ndenied subparagraph 1.a. He also submitted additional information in support of his\nrequest for a security clearance.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for a\nclearance because he has engaged in criminal conduct.\nApplicant and his wife were married in 2000. She is a law enforcement\nprofessional. By late 2007 they were having marital problems. In early 2008 Applicant\nmoved out of the marital home, but visited his wife and children.\nIn March 2008 the Applicant and his wife became engaged in an emotional and\nheated argument over their future. The Applicant, by his own admission, lost control of\nthe situation and accidentally fired his wife\u2019s service weapon. He was not aiming the\nweapon at his wife or himself.\nBecause of his wife\u2019s position, and the fact that their two young children were in\nthe house at the time of the incident, it was reported to law enforcement. Eventually, the\nApplicant was charged with Discharge of a Firearm. The case was originally charged as\na felony, but he eventually plead nolo contendere to a misdemeanor version of the\nsame charge in January 2009. He was sentenced to serve 30 days in jail, 30 days\ncommunity service, 36 months probation and attend a one year domestic violence\ncourse. (Government Exhibits 4 and 7; Transcript at 45-53.) As of the time of the\nhearing, Applicant was successfully attending the domestic violence course. (Applicant\nExhibit B at 13.) He will be on probation until January 2012.\nApplicant has been attempting to have his plea withdrawn and his case\ndismissed. While his attorney has filed some documents with the court, there is no\ninformation as to the current status of his appeal. (Applicant Exhibit A, Exhibit B at 4,\n28-51.)\n\n3\nImmediately after the incident, Applicant moved out of the marital house. He and\nhis wife separated, and remain separated as of the date of the hearing.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he is financially overextended, and therefore at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant and his wife owned a house that they bought in 2005. Applicant took\nout two mortgages, for a total of approximately $262,000. (SOR 2.a. and 2.b.) After he\nleft the house in March 2008, Applicant could no longer afford to pay the mortgages and\nmaintain another household. His wife also left the house. It was foreclosed on and sold\nduring the height of the recession in April 2009 for $38,000. (Applicant Exhibit B at 52-\n64; Transcript at 55-58, 61-64.) Under the applicable state anti-deficiency statute, the\nforeclosure sale wiped out any indebtedness owed by the Applicant. (Transcript at 88-\n89.)\nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation is stable, as is shown by the most recent\ncredit report in the record, dated October 29, 2009. (Government Exhibit 11.) He shares\ncustody of his daughters and works two jobs to make ends meet. (Applicant Exhibit B at\n6-7; Transcript at 65-73.)\nMitigation\nSeveral co-workers and friends submitted letters on the Applicant\u2019s behalf. He is\ndescribed as responsible, dedicated and enthusiastic. The letters from his supervisors\nindicate that he has been given increasing levels of responsibility. (Applicant Exhibit B at\n22-25.)\nApplicant\u2019s father testified on his behalf. (Transcript at 31-43.) He testified about\nthe incident between Applicant and his wife, his son\u2019s remorse and how Applicant is\nresolving the situation. The witness also testified about the fact that, until the separation,\nApplicant was very good about paying his bills.\nEvidence was also submitted showing that the Applicant kept his employer fully\nand promptly informed of the proceedings in this case. (Government Exhibit 4.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision. In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his or her own common\nsense, as well as knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n\n5\nAnalysis\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 30:      \nCriminal activity creates doubts about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nApplicant was involved in a single act of accidentally discharging his wife\u2019s\nservice weapon during a domestic dispute, which resulted in the Applicant being\narrested, and convicted of a misdemeanor. AG \u00b6 31(a) under Guideline J applies to this\ncase, stating that a disqualifying condition is \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses.\u201d AG \u00b6 31(d) also applies, \u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation.\u201d\nTwo of the mitigating conditions also apply and have been considered.  They are\nAG \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment\u201d; and AG \u00b6\n32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\u201d \nApplicant admitted to, and regrets, his poor judgment on this occasion. It\nhappened in extremely unusual circumstances and he has taken steps to make sure it\ndoes not happen again. Though he is still on probation, that fact is mitigated by the\neighteen months since the incident, without recurrence of any criminal acts, and his\ntaking a domestic violence course.\nBased on all of the evidence presented, Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcerns of his single misdemeanor conviction of Discharge of a Firearm, and the\nfactual circumstances behind it. Paragraph 1 of the SOR is found for the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n\n6\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant, by his own admission, and supported by the documentary\nevidence, had approximately $265,000 in past-due mortgage debts, which have been\ndue and owing since 2008. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(b)\nstates that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Finally,\nAG \u00b6 20(d) states it is mitigating where \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant=s financial difficulties\narose in about 2008, in relation to his criminal case, and separation from his wife. Given\nthe circumstances, he had no alternative but to let his house be foreclosed on in the\ncurrent financial situation. What is telling is the price the house went for at foreclosure.\nHis current financial situation is stable. These mitigating conditions apply to this case.\nParagraph 2 is found for the Applicant.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge must consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct,\ninvolving the accidental discharge of his wife\u2019s service weapon, occurred over eighteen\n\n7\nmonths ago. Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(1) and (2), Applicant\u2019s conduct was serious, but unique.\nBased on the state of the record, and as discussed in depth above, I find that there\nhave been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). This is in regards to the\nallegation of criminal conduct, and also his ability to handle his financial affairs.\nAccordingly, at the present time, I find that there is no potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)); and that there is no likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b6\n2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal\nconduct, and financial considerations. The evidence supports his request for a security\nclearance. Accordingly, Paragraphs 1 and 2 are found for the Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his latest Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP), on September 3, 2008 (Item 5). He previously submitted an e-QIP \non August 29, 2003 (Item 6). On August 28, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) (Item 1). \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant received \nthe SOR on August 31, 2009 (Item 3). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 13, 2009. He admitted all of \nthe allegations, and elected to have the matter decided on the written record in lieu of a \nhearing (Item 4). Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s written case on \nNovember 4, 2009. Applicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on \nNovember 10, 2009, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and submit \nMarch 26, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \nmaterial to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. He did not provide \nadditional information. The case was assigned to me on February 17, 2010. Based \nupon a review of the case file, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under Guidelines H and E. I carefully \nreviewed the case file and the pleadings, and make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 46 years old. He is a high school graduate, married, with one child. \nAt the time he submitted his September 3, 2008 e-QIP, he was waiting for a \ndetermination of his request for a security clearance to serve as a security officer for a \ndefense contractor. While waiting a determination on his security clearance, he was \nworking as an outside survey officer for the defense contractor (Item 5). Applicant had \npreviously submitted an e-QIP on August 29, 2003 (Item 6). He was granted access to \nclassified information on November 23, 2004 (Item 13). In April 2007, he was employed \nas a security officer for the defense contractor but was terminated after he accidently \ndischarged his weapon and failed a drug test for marijuana and cocaine (Items 12). \nApplicant was referred by his employer to a drug treatment clinic and was treated by a \nlicensed social worker on at least six occasions for drug dependence. His last treatment \nwas on June 4, 2007 (Item 10). \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admits he used marijuana from at least 1996 \nuntil 2007 (Item 4). He resigned his position as a corrections officer in December 1996 \nafter he was questioned by police about his purchase and use of marijuana. Applicant \narrived at a residence while drug enforcement officers were executing a search-warrant \nsearch at the premises. The occupants told police Applicant was one of their customers. \nAt the time, Applicant was a corrections officer for the local court system (item 7). \nApplicant admitted in an affidavit to security investigators that he inhaled a line of \ncocaine as well as cocaine sprinkled in a marijuana cigarette in January 2007. Applicant \nalso admitted he tested positive for marijuana and cocaine in March 2007, after being \ntested for drugs when his weapon discharged while he was working as a security officer \nfor the defense contractor. Applicant noted on his security clearance application that he \nused marijuana and cocaine six to ten times from January to March 2007 (Item 5). He \nstated he does not intend to use marijuana or cocaine in the future (Item 9). \n \n \n \nApplicant answered \"No\" in response to questions concerning his drug use on his \nAugust 29, 2003 security clearance application. He answered no to questions 27 and 28 \nasking if in the last seven years or since the age of 16, he ever used a controlled \nsubstance while employed as a law enforcement official or while holding a security \nclearance (item 6). On his September 3, 2008, security clearance application, he noted \nthat he used marijuana and cocaine from January 2007 until April 2007, but did not list \nany previous illegal drug use (Item 5).  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised Administrative Guidelines. In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . .\u201d The \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to obtaining a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair \njudgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. Drugs are mood and behavior altering \n\n \n4 \n \nsubstances, and include those listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. \nMarijuana is listed in the Act. Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or the use of a legal \ndrug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction (AG \u00b6 24).  \n \n \nApplicant admitted to using marijuana from 1996 until 2007. He admitted using \ncocaine and marijuana six to ten times from January to March 2007. He had to possess \nthe marijuana to use it. He was granted a security clearance in 2004. His drug use \nraises Drug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions (DI DC) AG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug use); DI \nDC AG \u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution); and DI DC AG \u00b6 25(g) (any illegal drug use after being \ngranted a security clearance).  \n \n \nI have considered the Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (DI MC) and find \nnone apply. Applicant admitted using marijuana for an extended period of time. He \nadmitted using cocaine as recently as 2007.  Even though he states he stopped using \nmarijuana and cocaine in 2007, it is recent when compared to his over ten years of \nregular drug use. His use of marijuana and cocaine is therefore recent and frequent. DI \nMC AG \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. \nApplicant notes that he has not used marijuana or cocaine since 2007. He states he \ndoes not intend to use marijuana or cocaine in the future. His statement alone is not a \nclear intent to stop using marijuana or cocaine. There is no indication of any changed \ncircumstances that may indicate his intent not to use illegal drugs in the future. In \naddition, this stated intent is too recent and is in response to interrogatories, as opposed \nto his long history of drug use. DI MC AG \u00b6 26(b) (a demonstrated intent not to abuse \ndrugs in the future, such as; (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate \nperiod of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation) does not apply because he failed to provide evidence to \nsupport the mitigating condition. Applicant used marijuana and cocaine willingly while \nholding a security clearance, and while serving in a law enforcement position of trust. \nHe failed to provide any mitigating evidence for his use while holding a security \nclearance. Applicant has not presented sufficient information to overcome the security \nconcern for his use of marijuana and cocaine. Guideline H is decided against Applicant \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process (AG \u00b6 15). Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information. The security \nclearance system depends on the individual providing correct and accurate information. \n\n \n5 \n \nIf a person conceals or provides false information, the security clearance process \ncannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified information is in the \nbest interest of the United States Government. Applicant\u2019s false answers on his August \n2003 security clearance application concerning his use of marijuana from 1996 until \n2003, and his use while serving as a law enforcement official raise a security concern. \nHis failure to list all of his drug use on the 2008 security clearance application also \nraises security concerns. His false answers raise concerns under Personal Conduct \nDisqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(a) (the deliberate omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history, or similar form used to conduct investigations, to determine security \neligibility or trustworthiness). The discharge of his weapon after using illegal drugs, his \nresignation as a law enforcement official after being at a residence that was a known \ndrug distribution point, as well as illegal drug use while holding a security clearance \nraises PC DC AG \u00b6 16(c) (credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulation, or other character issues indicating \nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information). \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he deliberately failed to answer drug-related questions \ncorrectly and accurately on his August 29, 2003, security clearance application.  While \nthere is a security concern for an omission, concealment, or falsification of a material \nfact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a \nsecurity clearance, every omission, concealment, or inaccurate statement is not a \nfalsification. A falsification must be deliberate and material. It is deliberate if it is done \nknowingly and willfully. Applicant notes that since he was not arrested for any offense, \nhe was confused by the question. However, the question is straightforward and directly \nasks if he ever used illegal drugs in the last seven year or while a law enforcement \nofficial. There is little chance for confusion. I find that Applicant deliberately failed to \ndisclose all of his drug use and answered the question to hide his drug use. It is evident \nto any applicant for a security clearance that a clear reason for denying access to \nclassified formation is long term extensive drug use, particularly if the individual used it \nwhile a law enforcement official. For this same reason, he did not list his early drug use, \nbut only recent use, in answer to a similar question on his 2007 application. His conduct \nin using illegal drugs while holding a security clearance, and using drugs while carrying \na weapon shows questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, and failure to follow rules \nand regulations. I find against Applicant as to Personal Conduct.   \n \n \u201cWhole-Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge evaluates the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all of the circumstances. An administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n6 \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commons sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept.   \n \n \nApplicant has not established that he is trustworthy, reliable, and exercises good \njudgment.  To the contrary, he used marijuana and cocaine recently and frequently. He \nused illegal drugs while a law enforcement official, and while holding a security \nclearance. He did not provide full and complete information about his long-term drug \nuse on his security clearance applications. Even though he stated he does not intend to \nuse illegal drugs in the future, he did not present any information to support his intent. \nApplicant used marijuana and cocaine while being trusted with access to classified \ninformation. He provided no evidence to convince me he should be trusted again. The \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for \na security clearance. For all these reasons, Applicant has not mitigated drug \ninvolvement and personal conduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.i: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He held teaching positions, and was also stationed \nin Washington, D.C. and overseas working in the area of international affairs. He \nreceived outstanding evaluations during his Air Force career. Applicant accepted \nemployment with a defense contractor in May 2006, starting as a senior policy \nadvisor. His evaluations indicate excellent performance. On a scale where a score of \n5 indicates Outstanding, Applicant has received a 5 in every category in each year \nfrom 2006 through his most recent rating period of 2008-2009. In 2007, he was \npromoted to his current position of vice president. Applicant holds a top secret \nsecurity clearance, which he has held continuously since 1980. (GE 1, 5; AE A, B, F; \nTr. 19, 46-51, 53-56) \n \nApplicant first drank alcohol in 1973, but drank infrequently. When he entered \nthe Air Force in 1980, his drinking increased. Although his pattern varied, he had \nperiods of increased drinking, such as 1990-1991, when he worked on his doctorate. \nFrom 1995 to 2005, he worked in high-level jobs in Washington, D.C and overseas. \nAs work pressure increased, such as during his overseas assignments from 1999 to \n2002, his drinking became heavier. Friction with his wife and family also escalated. \nIn September 2005, Applicant submitted his Air Force retirement papers. (Answer; \nAE I; Tr. 56-60) \n                                                 \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Adjudicative Guidelines, which supersede the \nguidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness \ndeterminations in which an SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n \n2\n\n \n \nIn Fall 2005, several events occurred concerning Applicant's drinking: friends \nspoke to him about his drinking; his supervisor insisted he seek help; Applicant \nthought his work might be suffering from his use of alcohol; and his wife was \nunhappy with his alcohol use. In November 2005, Applicant sought help through the \nAir Force Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) program at a \nlocal Air Force base. He reported to the location while under the influence of alcohol. \nHe was evaluated and admitted into the program, and his duty location was \ntransferred to the base where ADAPT was located.3 (Tr. 60-65, 68, 86-89) \n \nThe program required that Applicant abstain from alcohol during treatment. \nHe abstained for the first three months, and drank intermittently during the last two \nmonths. Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol dependence by an Air Force clinical \npsychologist. He was advised to abstain from alcohol after completing treatment. \nThe ADAPT discharge summary noted that Applicant chose to drink, but that he \nwould be continuing with alcohol treatment. Applicant believed that abstaining \nindicated a failure of character because it meant he could not control his use of \nalcohol. He believed he could control it, and therefore opted to use the Rational \nRecovery method. It offers tools to achieve moderate alcohol use, for those who are \nable to control their drinking. The ADAPT counselor provided him with material about \nRational Recovery. Applicant ended his treatment at ADAPT in April 2006, because \nhe was retiring from the Air Force, and the program is limited to active duty \npersonnel. When Applicant's ADAPT record was reviewed by the ADAPT Program \nManager/clinical psychologist in January 2010, she interpreted the record as \nindicating that his treatment was successful. She also noted that his sobriety since \nNovember 2008 indicates that he has been making good judgments, and that he has \na strong prognosis. (Answer; AE C, H; Tr. 60-67, 68, 86-89)  \n \nAfter leaving ADAPT, Applicant successfully followed the Rational Recovery \napproach for about one year. However, he became overconfident in his success, \nand his drinking slowly increased. In October 2007, he attended several events, \ndrank too much alcohol, and decided to drive. He hit a parked car and was arrested. \nBefore his court appearance, Applicant entered the Self-Management and Recovery \nTraining (SMART) alcohol counseling program. Subsequently, he pled guilty to \nOperating a Motor Vehicle While Impaired. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail \n(suspended) and one year of probation; his driving privileges were revoked for six \nmonths; he was required to perform community service; and to attend an alcohol \nprogram and a victims\u2019 panel program. He met the court\u2019s requirements, including \ncompleting the 12-hour \u201cAbout Face\u201d DWI treatment course, and his probation was \nterminated early. (Answer; AE D, E; Tr. 67-74) \n \n                                                 \n3 The SOR alleges that Applicant was found to be \u201cnot fit for duty.\u201d Applicant denied this description, \nand testified that he was designated \u201cS4T\u201d or \u201cnot worldwide qualified\u201d because Air Force regulations \nrequire that ADAPT patients be placed on an S4T profile. See Air Force Instruction 44-121, \u00a73.18.1. \n \n \n3\n\n \nApplicant started attending weekly SMART meetings in October 2007, after \nhis arrest. His facilitator at SMART testified at the hearing. He also submitted a letter \nin which he describes SMART as a worldwide, abstinence-based, nonprofit \norganization generally viewed as an alternative to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). \nWhen Applicant entered SMART, he abstained from alcohol for several weeks.4 The \nfacilitator advised him to continue to abstain; however, Applicant believed he could \ndrink moderately. He did so for six to eight months, but then the frequency and \namount of his alcohol consumption began to increase. He stopped attending SMART \nin August 2008. Over the next few months, he realized the pattern was beginning \nagain, and that he was causing pain to his wife and family. He had many discussions \nwith his wife, who offered to provide whatever help he needed. He came to the \nconclusion that abstinence was the only solution. He consumed his last alcoholic \ndrink on November 6, 2008. He then resumed attending SMART meetings. At the \nsame time, he began attending weekly AA meetings. The SMART facilitator noted \nthat Applicant is a major contributor to the group\u2019s discussions. He opined that \nApplicant has made a serious commitment, and is willing to work hard at maintaining \nabstinence. He considers Applicant to be a \u201csuccess story.\u201d Currently, Applicant \nattends weekly meetings of both SMART and AA. (Answer; AE G; Tr. 23-44, 67-78) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material \ninformation, and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).5 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \n\u201cwhole person\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific \napplicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against \nthem as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to \nclassified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by \nthe parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors \naddressed under the cited guideline.   \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest6 for an applicant to either \nreceive or continue to have access to classified information. The Government bears \nthe initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the \npreliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant. \n                                                 \n4 Applicant testified to several weeks of abstinence when he entered SMART. However, his Answer \nindicates three months of abstinence at the beginning of the SMART program. (Answer; Tr. 73). \n5 Directive. 6.3. \n6 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n4\n\n \nAdditionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the \nSOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a \nsecurity clearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.7  \n \n \nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \nGovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \ninterests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d \nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability \nfor access in favor of the Government.8 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern about alcohol consumption is that \u201cexcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 21). \n \nAG \u00b6 22 includes the following relevant conditions that can raise security \nconcerns and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the \npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the \nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an \nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol use since the 1980s has varied from moderate to heavy, \nand at times he drank to intoxication. In 2007, Applicant hit a parked car when he \ndecided to drive after drinking. He pled guilty to operating a motor vehicle while \nimpaired. His history supports application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c). AG \u00b6 22(e) also \n                                                 \n6 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n7 See Egan;  Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n \n5\n\n \napplies because he was evaluated as alcohol dependent by a clinical psychologist \nwhen he attended the Air Force\u2019s ADAPT alcohol treatment program.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides two conditions that can mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of \nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser); and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics \nAnonymous or a similar organization and has received a favorable \nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program. \n \nApplicant had a history of alcohol use, at times heavy. In 2005, he realized he \nhad a problem when his supervisor, friends, and family talked with him about it. He \ndecided to attend the Air Force\u2019s ADAPT treatment program. He struggled with \ntrying to use alcohol in moderation, rather than abstaining. However, he eventually \nrealized through experience that moderation would not solve the problem. He now \nrecognizes and accepts that he must abstain. He has established a pattern of \nabstinence since November 2008. AG \u00b6 23(b) applies.  \n \nThe ADAPT treatment records note that Applicant had not met his goal \nbecause he did not abstain from drinking. However, since that time, Applicant has \ncommitted himself to refraining from drinking alcohol. He has demonstrated \ncommitment by remaining alcohol-free since November 2008. In addition, the current \nADAPT Program Manager/psychologist who reviewed his ADAPT record in 2010 \ncharacterized his treatment as successful. Most importantly, she noted that his \ncurrent record of abstinence indicates he is making good judgments and has a \nstrong prognosis. His SMART facilitator notes his thoughtful participation and the \nsignificant contribution he makes at meetings. He attends weekly sessions of \nSMART and AA. AG \u00b6 23(d) applies. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis   \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n6\n\n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the cited \nguideline, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light \nof all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nApplicant served honorably for 26 years in the Air Force. He established an \nimpressive career both in the Air Force, and in his subsequent civilian career with a \ndefense contractor. However, he has also had a long history of alcohol abuse and \ndependence. It has had serious negative effects on himself and his family. Despite \nspending time in the Air Force ADAPT alcohol treatment program, and the diagnosis \nof alcohol dependence, he continued to maintain that he could drink alcohol \nmoderately. He used the Rational Recovery method in an effort to confirm his belief. \nEven after his conviction for driving a vehicle while impaired by alcohol, and the \nconsequences of that conviction, he still believed he did not have to abstain.  \n \n \nApplicant entered the SMART program after his drunk-driving arrest. Its \nrational approach appealed to him, but he still struggled with the need to abstain \ncompletely. Finally, after a period when his alcohol use was again increasing, and \nafter many discussions with his wife, he realized that he must abstain. As of \nNovember 2008, he no longer drinks alcohol. He has attended weekly SMART \nmeetings since that time, and weekly AA meetings as well. He has the full support of \nhis family. His facilitator at SMART considers him a success story. His conduct since \n2008 shows serious commitment to avoiding the mistakes of the past.  \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence satisfies the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline G. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G  \n \nFOR Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.e.  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n7\n\n \n \n8\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \nRITA C. O\u2019BRIEN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

Garcia, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Anthony DeSisto, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant\u201fs use of alcohol to cope with his spouse\u201fs infidelity led to a January 2004 \ndomestic assault offense, repeated violations of protective orders in 2004, and a November \n2004 drunk driving incident. He completed court-mandated treatment for diagnosed alcohol \nabuse in 2005, but drove while impaired by alcohol in September 2008. A clinical social \nworker assessed Applicant as not having an alcohol problem in October 2008, but there is \nindication that Applicant was not upfront with her about his alcohol abuse. Despite 15 \nadditional sessions of court-ordered alcohol counseling completed in May 2010, he \ncontinues to minimize the impact of alcohol on his behavior. Clearance denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn December 23, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nG, Alcohol Consumption, and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct that provided the basis for its \npreliminary decision to revoke his security clearance. DOHA acted under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \n \nJanuary 31, 2011\n\n \n \n2 \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations on January 16, 2010, and indicated he \ndid not want a hearing. The Government requested a hearing, and the case was assigned \nto me to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. On April 30, 2010, counsel for Applicant entered \nhis appearance. On May 3, 2010, I scheduled a hearing for May 25, 2010. \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Twenty-one Government exhibits (Ex. 1-21) \nand two Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-B) were entered into evidence. Applicant testified, as \nreflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on June 7, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, that Applicant consumed \nalcohol, at times to excess and intoxication, from about 1976 to at least September 2008 \n(SOR 1.a); that he received treatment from March 2004 to April 2005 for diagnosed alcohol \nabuse as ordered by the court for a January 2004 domestic assault incident (SOR 1.b); that \nhe was fined for a November 2004 driving while intoxicated offense and refusal to submit to \na chemical test (SOR 1.c); and that he pleaded guilty and was sentenced for a September \n2008 refusal to submit to a chemical test\u2014second offense (SOR 1.d). \n \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, that Applicant was arrested \nfor domestic disorderly conduct and domestic simple assault in January 2004, a restraining \norder was issued against him, and he was ordered into counseling (SOR 2.a); that a \nprotective order, issued against him in family court, was in effect from February 2004 to \nMarch 2007 (SOR 2.b); that he was arrested in March 2004 for a misdemeanor violation of \nthat protective order (SOR 2.c), and in August 2004 for a felony violation of that protective \norder (SOR 2.d); that he was arrested and sentenced for DWI and refusal to submit to \nchemical test in November 2004 (SOR 2.e); that he was sentenced to home confinement on \na December 2004 violation of probation charge (SOR 2.f); and that he was arrested and \nsentenced for a September 2008 refusal to submit to a chemical test \u2014 second offense \n(SOR 2.g). \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant denied that he consumed alcohol to excess over \nthe period alleged, and explained that he exercised good judgment in his drinking until late \n2003 into 2004, when he turned to alcohol to cope with the stress from his spouse\u201fs \nextramarital affair and the dissolution of his marriage. He indicated that after his 2004 \narrests, he reduced his alcohol consumption significantly. Applicant disputed the dates \nalleged for his counseling. He acknowledged it was court-ordered but not because of a \ndiagnosis of alcohol abuse. Applicant admitted that several charges were filed against him, \nbut stressed that he was not convicted of criminal DWI for either the November 2004 or \nSeptember 2008 incidents. He denied any felony charges on the basis that the August 2004 \nviolation of the protective order was a second offense and hence a misdemeanor. After \nconsidering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n\n \n \n3 \nApplicant is a 52-year-old senior systems engineer, who has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since March 1997. He holds a secret-level security clearance, which was \ngranted in August 1998. (Ex. 21.) Applicant was granted his first security clearance in 1981. \n(Tr. 29.)  \n \nApplicant began drinking as a college student. From 1976 to 1980, he consumed a \nfew beers with friends on Thursday evenings and on the weekends. After college, he began \nhis career with a defense contractor in June 1980. (Tr. 31.) Applicant drank beer and \noccasional mixed drinks on weekends at bars and restaurants. In August 1983, Applicant \nmarried his now ex-wife. They had three children, who are now ages 25, 21, and 19. (Ex. 1.) \nAfter getting married, he moderated his consumption to one or two beers after work at home \nonce or twice a week and on weekends. (Ex. 2.) \n \nAround 2002, Applicant\u201fs marriage began to deteriorate. He learned his spouse was \nhaving an affair (Tr. 32-34.), and he turned to alcohol to cope with marital issues and stress. \nHe began drinking three or four beers a night at home, and more on the weekends. (Tr. 60.) \nHis drinking led to several criminal charges in 2004, as follows: \n \nIn January 2004, Applicant consumed five or six beers (Tr. 62.) and returned home \nupset with his spouse over her infidelity. He physically assaulted his spouse (repeatedly \npushed her into a wall) and 12-year-old daughter (pushed her into a bedroom). Applicant \nthen punched his 18-year-old son, who had intervened to protect his mother. (Ex. 2, 5; Tr. \n62.) His younger son called the police (Tr. 62.), and Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith one count of disorderly conduct and three counts of domestic simple assault/battery. \n(Ex. 4, 5.) On February 11, 2004, a restraining order was issued, ordering him to stay away \nfrom his spouse and daughter. (Ex. 4, 9.) In March 2004, he pleaded no contest to one \ncount of domestic simple assault against his wife for the January 2004 incident. He was \nordered to pay $118.50 costs, to have no contact with his spouse, and to continue alcohol \ntreatment ordered by the family court that he had just started. (Ex. 9, A.) The other counts \nwere dismissed. (Ex. 4, 6, A.) \n \nApplicant began court-ordered outpatient domestic violence counseling and alcohol \ncounseling in March 2004. He was given a diagnosis on admission of alcohol abuse. (Ex. 7.) \nDespite his ongoing counseling, Applicant continued to violate the protective order. On \nMarch 20, 2004, Applicant was charged with violation of protective order that had been \nissued against him on March 3, 2004. (Ex. 9, 11.). After consuming at least \u201ca few drinks,\u201d \nhe called his spouse, allegedly to inform her that he was depositing funds she requested \ninto her account. (Ex. 2; Tr. 36.) A protective order was renewed, enjoining him from any \ncontact with his wife and older son. In June 2004, Applicant pleaded no contest and the \ncharge was filed for one year on payment of $118.50 costs. (Ex. 2, 4, 11, A.) The family \ncourt ordered him to continue his counseling. (Ex. 9.) \n \nApplicant\u201fs counselor filed a progress report with the family court in April 2004 \nindicating no signs of substance abuse or dependency on Applicant\u201fs part. (Ex. 9.) As of \nAugust 3, 2004, Applicant had completed the domestic violence counseling and alcohol \ncounseling court-ordered for the January 2004 incident. (Ex. 6.) But he was ordered to \ncontinue treatment because he violated the no-contact order in March 2004. (Tr. 38.) \n\n \n \n4 \nOn August 8, 2004, after drinking at least \u201ca few beers\u201d at a local restaurant, \nApplicant called his spouse. When she did not answer, he went to her workplace and \nfollowed her as she left work. (Tr. 36-37/) She contacted the police, and Applicant was \narrested for violation of protective order\u2014third offense, a felony. The officer detected a \nstrong odor of alcohol on Applicant\u201fs breath. (Ex. 12.) The protective order was renewed in \ndistrict court (Ex. 13.), and Applicant was charged with misdemeanor violation of a \nprotective order. He pleaded no contest and was sentenced to one year in prison \n(suspended), one year probation, and house confinement. (Ex. 2, 13, A.) \n \nOn August 19, 2004, Applicant appeared in family court, where he was granted \nsupervised visitation with his minor children on the condition that he attend and complete a \nbatterer\u201fs program and substance abuse screens. His restraining order was to remain in \neffect until March 3, 2007. (Ex. 9.) In October 2004, the family court granted Applicant \nalternating weekend visitation and Wednesday overnight visitation with his minor children, \ndiscontinued supervised visitation, and amended the no-contact order to allow for contact \nbetween Applicant and his spouse on matters relating to their minor children. (Ex. 9, 13.) \n \nAs of October 2004, Applicant\u201fs counselor assessed his condition as improved. In \nearly November 2004, Applicant was formally discharged after 16 sessions with a diagnosis \nof alcohol abuse\u2014decreased use. His counselor recommended that he attend Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA) meetings if he continued to drink alcohol to deal with his moods. She gave \nhim a good prognosis if he decreased his alcohol use and resolved grieving issues over the \nloss of his marriage. (Ex. 7.) \n \n In early November 2004, Applicant ran a stop sign and crashed into the rear of \nanother vehicle. He had consumed between eight and ten beers before the accident (Ex. 2; \nTr. 55.), and responding police detected signs of alcohol on Applicant (slurred speech, \nstrong odor of alcohol on breath, watery and bloodshot eyes). Applicant failed field sobriety \ntests, and he was arrested for DWI, first offense. He refused to submit to a chemical test at \nthe station and a refusal charge was added. (Ex. 2, 14.) The DWI charge was dismissed in \ncourt in return for a guilty plea to refusal to submit to a chemical test. (Ex. 15, A.) He was \nfined and ordered to complete 10 hours of community service. (Ex. 2.)  The November 2004 \ndrunk-driving incident was in violation of his probation for the August 2004 offense, and in \nearly December 2004, he was sentenced to six months community (house) confinement \nwith electronic monitoring, and to substance abuse and domestic abuse counseling. He was \nreleased early from home confinement, in February 2005. (Ex. 2, 17.) \n \nIn 2005, Applicant often stopped for dinner before going home to his apartment. He \ndrank on average two beers a night and three or four on the weekends, but abstained from \nalcohol when he had his children. (Tr. 40, 55.) Applicant participated in two counseling \nsessions in April 2005 with the counselor who had treated him in 2004.  At discharge in late \nApril 2005, the counselor indicated that Applicant had resolved his legal issues and divorce \ncrisis (his divorce was finalized in December 2005), but she again gave him a diagnosis of \nalcohol abuse. She indicated that he minimized the effect of alcohol on his life, although \nhad committed himself to not abuse alcohol. Counseling on the next phase of life \nadjustment was recommended.  She noted his progress was good if he remained focused. \nShe recommended aftercare that included \u201c12 step if acceptance of ETOH problem.\u201d (Ex. \n\n \n \n5 \n7.) After his counseling, Applicant drank on average 10 to 15 beers a week. His goal was to \navoid drinking to intoxication, which he claims he met. (Tr. 75-76.) \n \n \nIn September 2006, a medical emergency led Applicant to stop drinking alcohol \naltogether until about mid-2007. (Tr. 41-42.) He began dating his current girlfriend, and \ndrank three or four beers with dinner when out with her on Friday or Saturday nights or both. \n(Tr. 42-43.) Starting in late 2007, he began drinking one or two beers a night after work two \nor three nights a week in addition to a six-pack of beer over the course of a weekend. (Ex. \n2.) Applicant believed he could handle his drinking on his own. (Tr. 75-76, 87.) \n \nIn mid to late September 2008, Applicant decided to take a couple of days off from \nwork while his employer found him a new assignment. Applicant stopped off at a restaurant \non September 25, 2008, to have a few beers with some friends, but \u201ca couple of beers led \nto a few too many.\u201d (Tr. 44-45.) Driving home after he had consumed at least five beers, he \nwas stopped for failure to remain in his travel lane. A strong odor of alcohol was detected \nabout Applicant and he failed field sobriety tests. He was placed in custody and issued a \nsummons for refusal to submit to a chemical test \u2014 second offense. (Ex. 2, 17.) Applicant \nrefused to submit to the breathalyzer because he suspected he would have failed the test. \n(Tr. 45.)  \n \nApplicant was referred by pretrial services to counseling for stress management. On \nOctober 9, 2008, Applicant underwent a diagnostic evaluation. A licensed clinical social \nworker diagnosed Applicant with adjustment disorder (unspecified). Applicant did not report \nany past history of abuse to the clinician, and based on Applicant\u201fs statements, the clinician \nfound no evidence of a substance abuse issue. (Ex. 20, B.) Applicant denies any intent to \nmislead the clinician (Tr. 48.), but the evidence indicates he was not fully forthcoming about \nhis alcohol abuse history. The social worker left it to Applicant\u201fs discretion to pursue \ncounseling for daily stressors. (Ex. B.) Applicant did not follow through with a counseling \nappointment. (Ex. 18, 20.) \n \nIn November 2008, Applicant pleaded no contest in court to the refusal charge, and \nhe was sentenced to six months in custody of adult correction with 30 days to be spent in \nhome confinement and the balance suspended, six months probation, a $600 fine plus \ncosts and assessments for a total of $1,340.50, 60 hours of community service, 12 months \nloss of license, and DWI school (driver retraining) with a substance abuse assessment, and \nif necessary, counseling. (Ex. 18.) Applicant was discharged from home confinement in late \nDecember 2008. (Ex. 16, 19.) \n \n \nApplicant notified his supervisor of the chemical refusal charge shortly after his \narrest. (Ex. 2.) On October 3, 2008, he applied for renewal of his security clearance and \ndisclosed the then-pending charge, as well as the November 2004 refusal-to-submit charge, \nthe March 2004 and August 2004 violations of a no-contact order, and the January 2004 \n\u201cdomestic disturbance.\u201d (Ex. 1.) \n \n \nOn December 2, 2008, a Government investigator interviewed Applicant about his \narrest record and his alcohol abuse treatment. Applicant denied that alcohol was involved in \nthe August 2004 violation of the protective order. He now acknowledges he had consumed \n\n \n \n6 \naround three beers. (Tr. 95-96.) Applicant admitted that only his supervisor and his \ndaughter, who lives with him, knew about the September chemical refusal charge, and that \nhe would be embarrassed if other family members and coworkers were to learn of his \narrest. Applicant admitted that he had not informed security officials at work that he was \nwearing an electronic monitor. Applicant indicated he had abstained from alcohol since his \nrecent arrest and he did not intend to consume alcohol in the future. (Ex. 2.) After his \ninterview, Applicant informed a security official at work about his electronic monitor. (Ex. 3.) \n \nApplicant abstained from alcohol for six months following his September 2008 arrest. \n(Tr. 48-49.) He resumed drinking around April 2009, one or two drinks while out to dinner \nwith his girlfriend once or twice a week on the weekends. He was still drinking in this pattern \nas of May 2010. (Tr. 48-49, 58.) Applicant testified that his girlfriend \u201clike [him] will have \nmaybe one or two glasses of wine\u201d when they go out. (Tr. 100.) \n \nApplicant was referred for additional counseling.1 He attended 15 sessions (five \nindividual and ten group sessions) from January to May 2010. (Tr. 47, 85-86.) On \ncompleting the counseling, Applicant satisfied the terms of his sentence for the September \n2008 chemical refusal. (Tr. 92.)  Concerning his prognosis, Applicant testified that his \ncounselor thought he (Applicant) \u201chad a good handle on how alcohol affects [his] behavior,\u201d \nand how to avoid a recurrence of September 2008, when he let himself get caught up in the \nfun and drank more than his intended two beers. (Tr. 88.) But the records of the referral for \ncounseling and the counseling itself are not in evidence and his testimony on that issue is \notherwise uncorroborated. \n \nApplicant now deals with his stress by exercising, restoring an old car, or riding his \nmotorcycle. (Tr. 89.) He does not believe that he has any current issues with alcohol or with \nstress management. (Tr. 98.) Applicant does not keep alcohol in his home. His daughter still \nlives with him while she commutes to a local community college. (Tr. 101.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u201eright\u201f to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u201fs suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u201fs eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u201fs overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \n                                                 \n1Applicant indicated in his response to the SOR that state law requires an automatic alcohol abuse evaluation \nand counseling when arrested for a breathalyzer or chemical test refusal. District court records (Ex. 18.) \nindicate that Applicant was sentenced on November 14, 2008, in part to an alcohol assessment and, if \nnecessary, counseling. \n\n \n \n7 \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive Order \n10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, \nSection 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern about alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive \nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u201fs reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d Applicant was seriously impaired by alcohol when he ran a stop sign in \nNovember 2004, and when he was pulled over for failure to stay in his lane in September \n2008. He drank between eight and ten beers before his arrest in November 2004 and he \nwould have failed a breathalyzer in September 2008. Alcohol was also involved in the \nJanuary 2004 domestic assault incident, and the protective order violations in March 2004 \nand August 2004. AG \u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving \nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser \nor alcohol dependent,\u201d applies. \n \nBefore his arrests in November 2004 and September 2008, Applicant engaged in \nbinge drinking within the meaning of AG \u00b6 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol \nto the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an \nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(e), \u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol \n\n \n \n8 \ndependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized \nalcohol treatment program,\u201d also applies. Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol abuse in \n2004 by a counselor on staff of an outpatient program authorized by the court to provide \nsubstance abuse treatment to offenders. The diagnosis did not change when Applicant \nreturned to the counselor for a couple of sessions in April 2005. And Applicant\u201fs abusive \ndrinking on September 25, 2008, qualifies as a relapse after treatment implicating AG \u00b6 \n22(f), \u201crelapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an alcohol \nrehabilitation program.\u201d \n \nApplicant has not been involved in any alcohol-related incident or been intoxicated \nsince September 2008. But it is difficult to apply AG \u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much time has passed, or \nthe behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u201fs current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment.\u201d His September 2008 abuse was serious, especially because it occurred \nafter counseling. He was referred for additional counseling, which he did not complete until \nMay 2010. \n \nAs set forth in AG \u00b6 23(b), an applicant with diagnosed alcohol abuse should \nacknowledge his or her issues of alcohol abuse, show evidence of actions taken to \novercome the problem, and establish a pattern of responsible use.2 Applicant was compliant \nwith his alcohol treatment because he faced sanctions by the court if he failed to comply. \nThis is not a case where he voluntarily sought help to address his alcohol problem. AG \u00b6 \n23(b) does not apply because his alcohol abuse on September 25, 2008 was not an \naberration. After he completed his counseling in 2005, Applicant drank about 10 to 15 beers \na week. A medical emergency in September 2006 led him to abstain until mid-2007. He \ntestified that he drank at most six alcohol drinks a week before his arrest in September \n2008, and that if he went out for dinner on a Friday or Saturday night, he might drink three \nor four. (Tr. 42.) But when he was interviewed in August 2009, he detailed heavier alcohol \nconsumption starting in late 2007. He indicated that his drinking increased to one or two \nbeers a night after work two or three nights a week, and a six pack of beer over the course \nof a weekend. He drank at home and in bars. This account of his drinking is more credible \nbecause it is more contemporaneous than his present recollection. His drinking of up to 10 \nto 12 drinks a week culminated in the September 2008 incident where he drove a motor \nvehicle impaired by alcohol. \n \nSince the September 2008 incident, Applicant has limited his drinking to one or two \ndrinks when he is out with his girlfriend. Even so, it is not enough for mitigation given his \nrelapse after counseling. AG \u00b6 23(d) requires successful completion of counseling, including \naftercare, \u201ca clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations,\u201d and a favorable prognosis.3 Applicant\u201fs \n                                                 \n2AG \u00b6 23(b) specifically states: \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, \nprovides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if \nalcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d \n \n3AG \u00b6 23(d) requires that \u201cthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or \nrehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings \nof Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \n\n \n \n9 \nfavorable assessment from a licensed social worker on October 9, 2008, was based on \nApplicant\u201fs false responses (no past history of abuses). Applicant\u201fs failure to acknowledge \nhis history of abuse calls into question whether he truly acknowledges his alcohol abuse \nproblem. Notwithstanding the social worker\u201fs assessment that further substance use or \nabuse counseling was not necessary, Applicant was subsequently required to undergo \nadditional counseling, which he did not complete until May 2010, shortly before the hearing \non his security eligibility. Applicant\u201fs claim of a recent favorable assessment is \nuncorroborated. \n \nApplicant is not required to abstain completely from alcohol in the absence of a \ndiagnosis of alcohol dependency. Yet it is difficult to fully apply either AG \u00b6 23(b) or \u00b6 23(d) \nin light of his recent counseling and ongoing tendency to blame others or his circumstances \nrather than acknowledge his drinking problem as a contributing factor, e.g., his son was very \naggressive towards him in the January 2004 incident (Tr. 64.); he doesn\u201ft recall pushing his \nwife or his daughter but \u201cperhaps in the melee things happen\u201d (Tr. 64.); he thought that he \nwas not as far down the road as he was and didn\u201ft see the stop sign that he ran in \nNovember 2004. (Tr. 81.) Applicant has not demonstrated the insight into his problem that \none would expect given his participation in outpatient counseling in 2004 and 2005 and \nagain in 2010. Alcohol consumption concerns are not fully mitigated. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern about criminal conduct is set out in Guideline J, AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u201fs judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u201fs ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nThe infidelity of Applicant\u201fs ex-wife was a contributing factor in his 2004 criminal \nconduct. However, it does not justify his January 2004 physical assaults of his family \nmembers, his violations of protective orders in March 2004 and August 2004, or his drunk \ndriving in November 2004, which was in violation of his probation. The evidence establishes \nthat Applicant drove while significantly impaired by alcohol in November 2004 and again in \nSeptember 2008, although he pled no contest to chemical refusal charges in both \ninstances. His criminal offenses implicate AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple \nlesser offenses\u201d and AG \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much times has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u201fs reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d applies to the extent \nthat the domestic abuse and protective order violations are not likely to recur. Applicant is \ndivorced from his spouse and there has been no recurrence of similar problems since 2004. \nHe exhibits remorse over the domestic abuse. See AG \u00b6 32(d) (\u201cthere  is evidence of \n                                                                                                                                                               \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program.\u201d \n\n \n \n10 \nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence \nof criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment \nrecord, or constructive community involvement\u201d). He has fulfilled the terms of his sentences, \nso he may be considered rehabilitated by the courts. But with the alcohol consumption \nconcerns not fully mitigated, a future alcohol-related criminal offense cannot be ruled out. \nHe has not mitigated the security concerns about his criminal conduct. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u201fs eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and all \nrelevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u201fs age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nApplicant is a long-time defense contractor employee who has not allowed alcohol to \ninterfere with his work performance. He also takes his parental responsibilities seriously. \nNotwithstanding the January 2004 assault involving his older son and his daughter, \nApplicant was granted overnight visitation with his children even while he was still struggling \nto cope with the breakup of his marriage. His personal situation has improved since his \ndivorce, and he has developed ways to deal with stress that do not involve alcohol (e.g., \nexercise, restoring an old car). But his history of alcohol abuse and alcohol-related criminal \nincidents continue to raise doubts about his judgment and reliability, especially when he was \nnot fully candid about his alcohol abuse during an October 2008 assessment for pretrial \nservices, and he continues to minimize the impact that alcohol has had on his behavior. \nBased on the record before me, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant continued eligibility for a security clearance at this time. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n \n11 \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the factual allegations under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f, with explanations. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e. His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 56-year-old senior field technician (information technology). He has worked for the same government contractor since April 1999, and requires a security clearance to continue his job. He completed an associate\u2019s degree in the mid-1980s. Applicant married his wife in 1980, and they have three grown children of this marriage, ages 36, 27, and 26.

His past behavior shows he does not have the ability or willingness to comply \nwith the law, rules, and regulations. Clearance denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on August 20, 2008. After \nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, on December 4, 2009, \nadjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to \nmake a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended; and Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as Error! Main \nDocument Only.revised. \nOctober 20, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \nOn September 1, 2006, DOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \nwhich specified the basis for its decision - security concerns addressed in the Directive \nunder Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2  \n \nOn December 21, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nMay 6, 2010, to determine whether a clearance should be granted or denied. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on May 21, 2010. The hearing was convened as scheduled \non June 11, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 17, which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant and one witness testified. Post-hearing, he \nsubmitted Exhibit (AE) 1, which was admitted without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 18, 2010.  \n \nProcedural Issue \n \n \nThe Government conceded, and the evidence shows, that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, and \n1.f are related to the same course of conduct. (Tr. 40) The misconduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b resulted in the administrative and rehabilitative actions in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. Thus, \nthese allegations will be merged into one allegation under SOR \u00b6 1.b. Favorable \nfindings will be entered with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f, \nwith explanations. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e. His admissions are incorporated as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings \nof fact. \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old senior field technician (information technology). He has \nworked for the same government contractor since April 1999, and requires a security \nclearance to continue his job. He completed an associate\u2019s degree in the mid-1980s. \nApplicant married his wife in 1980, and they have three grown children of this marriage, \nages 36, 27, and 26.  \n \nApplicant served in the U.S. Navy from 1978 until his retirement in 1998. His \nservice was characterized as honorable. His Veterans Administration disability rating is \n70%, because he suffered a work-related back injury. He possessed secret and top \nsecret security clearances during most of his Navy career. After his Navy retirement, \nApplicant\u2019s access to classified information was continued until the day of his hearing, \nbecause of his job with a government contractor.  \n \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the AGs, implemented by the DOD on September 1, \n2006. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \nApplicant started consuming alcohol and marijuana at age 20. He illegally \nsmoked marijuana daily from 1974 until 1987.3 In January 1987, he took 30 days leave \nand while on leave, he attended a party hosted by his sister. At the party, he was \ndrinking heavily and smoked marijuana. (GE 7) Upon his return to his unit, he tested \npositive for marijuana during a random drug test. At the time of his illegal use of \nmarijuana, he was serving in the Navy on active duty, held the grade of E-6, and \npossessed a top secret security clearance with access to sensitive compartmented \ninformation (SCI). In February 1987, Applicant received non-judicial punishment under \nArticle 15, UCMJ, for his illegal use of marijuana. His punishment included forfeiture of \n$576 pay per month for two months, reduction to the grade of E-5, and 45 days extra \nduties. (GE 3) Because of his alcohol and marijuana use, in July 1987, he was required \nto attend a Navy Level II drug and alcohol treatment program. Because of his use of \nmarijuana, in May 1988, the Naval Security Group denied Applicant access to SCI, and \nhe was reclassified to another rate. (GE 4)  \n \nIn January 1988, Applicant resumed his alcohol consumption. Under pressure \nfrom his wife, in May-June 1988, he underwent a six week, state-sponsored Level III \nalcohol program (impatient detoxification). He attended Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) for \nsix months as part of his aftercare treatment. In August 1989, Applicant resumed his \nalcohol consumption. In November 1992, Applicant received non-judicial punishment \nbecause he reported for duty while intoxicated. He was required to attend a second six \nweek Level III alcohol recovery program in a Navy medical facility. During the alcohol \nrehabilitation program, Applicant was diagnosed with \u201cALCOHOL DEPENDENCE IN \nREMISSION AND CANNABIS DEPENDENCE IN REMISSION BY HISTORY.\u201d (GE 6) \nDuring his alcohol treatment, Applicant admitted that he illegally smoked marijuana daily \nfrom 1974 until 1987. (GE 6)4 Upon his discharge, Applicant\u2019s progress in the program \nwas considered \u201cgood,\u201d and he was discharged to full duty. He was instructed to abstain \nfrom the use of alcohol and drugs, to attend AA four times a week for one year, and to \nparticipate in a supervised aftercare program. (Id.) \n \nIn 1995, the Department of the Navy Central Adjudication Facility (DON CAF) \nissued Applicant a statement of reasons indicating its intent to revoke his security \nclearance. In November 1995, the DON CAF conditionally granted Applicant access to \nclassified information on the condition that he continue to abstain from alcohol and \nillegal drugs, and continue to participate in AA. (GE 8-11) \n \nIn 1995-1996, Applicant resumed his consumption of alcohol. In December 2000, \nhe became depressed over his inability to stop consuming alcohol and cough syrup and \n \n3 GE 6, p. 1-2. In his answer to the SOR and at his hearing, Applicant claimed he used marijuana \nonly once in 1974, 1987, and 2008. Considering his statements to medical personnel, his history of failing \nto disclose material information in several security clearance applications, and his demeanor, I find his \nclaims and testimony lack credibility  \n \n4 In his October 1993 sworn statement (re-sworn in April 1994) to a government investigator, \nApplicant claimed his use of drug was sporadic. He averred he used marijuana once in 1974; speed and \nmorphine once each in 1977; and marijuana once in 1986. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nattempted suicide. (GE 14) He voluntarily attended outpatient addictions treatment at an \nAir Force\u2019s Intensive Addictions Service from April 2001 to May 2001. He was \ndiagnosed with SUBSTANCE DEPENDENCE.  \n \nIn December 2001, Applicant relapsed again, drove while intoxicated, and was \nconvicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI). He continued to participate in substance \nabuse aftercare treatment until February 2002. At the time of his discharge from the \nprogram, he was considered to be doing well and abstinent. At his hearing, Applicant \nclaimed he has been abstinent from alcohol since 2001. \n \nIn his November 2002 security clearance application, Applicant answered \u201cNO\u201d \nto questions that asked him whether he was ever charged with a felony offense, \nwhether he had ever been charged with or convicted of any offense related to alcohol or \ndrugs, and whether he ever had illegally used drugs while possessing a security \nclearance. He disclosed he received alcohol-related treatment in 2000, and his 2001 \nDWI. Applicant failed to disclose; however, that he used marijuana daily from 1974 until \n1987, his February 1987 non-judicial punishment for illegal use of marijuana, and his \n1992 non-judicial punishment for being drunk on duty.5 \n \nIn his August 2008 security clearance application, and at his hearing, Applicant \nadmitted he used marijuana one time in August 2008. He claimed he used marijuana \nwith a stranger to whom he gave a ride home.6 He had seen the stranger numerous \ntimes while riding the bus, but claimed he was not a friend of the stranger and did not \nknow him. During the ride, Applicant was commenting about his back pain and the \nstranger offered him a marijuana cigarette to relieve the pain. Applicant illegally smoked \nthe marijuana with the stranger to alleviate his back pain. Additionally, Applicant \ndisclosed his 2001 DWI and subsequent alcohol treatment, his 1992 non-judicial \npunishment for being drunk on duty, and his 1987 non-judicial punishment for use of \nmarijuana. \n \n \n5 The SOR did not allege security concerns under the guidelines for criminal conduct, personal \nconduct, and alcohol consumption. As such, disqualifying information under those guidelines cannot be \nused to deny Applicant\u2019s security clearance. Notwithstanding, I can consider any behavior not alleged in \nthe SOR to: assess his credibility; evaluate his evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed \ncircumstances; assess his possible rehabilitation; determine the applicability of the AGs; and conduct the \nwhole-person analysis. I have limited my consideration of non-SOR misconduct in accordance with ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).  \n \n6 Applicant admitted his August 2008 use of marijuana, but gave conflicting versions of the \ncircumstances. He told a government investigator in October 2008 that he pulled a back muscle in August \n2008, while cutting wood. Two young men, visiting his neighbor, offered him a marijuana cigarette. \nApplicant stated he was in so much pain he took two puffs of the marijuana cigarette. (GE 17) In his \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories, and at his hearing, Applicant denied he made the above statements. \nHe claimed the marijuana he smoked in August 2008 was provided to him by the stranger to whom he \ngave a ride home.(Id.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s doctor submitted a statement on his behalf indicating that \u201cto the best \nof my ability, my patient (Applicant), has no condition that could impair his judgment or \nreliability in the context of safeguarding classified information.\u201d (GE 18) \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant averred he only used marijuana three times over a \nperiod of 34 years, the last two times while possessing a security clearance. He noted \nthat the only reason the government was aware of his August 2008 use of marijuana \nwas because he was truthful and disclose it in his August 2008 security clearance \napplication. He disclosed his use of marijuana because he believes it is important for \nhim to tell the truth, and to avoid any possible basis for blackmail. He testified he told his \nsupervisor about his August 2008 use of marijuana approximately 18 months ago. \n \nApplicant testified he is an active member of Narcotics Anonymous (NA) and AA. \nHe said he attends two to three meetings every week to help him abstain from the use \nof any drugs and alcohol. He claimed he has abstained from the use of any illegal drugs \nsince August 2008, and that he has abstained from alcohol since 2001. After his \nhearing, Applicant submitted a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any \u201cabuse of drugs or alcohol.\u201d (AE 1) \n \nApplicant acknowledged he has an addictive personality, that he is alcohol \ndependent, and that he has a lifelong struggle to continue his abstinence. This \nknowledge has made him more determined to continue with his NA and AA aftercare \ntreatment. He averred that he has made lifestyle changes to control his alcohol \ndependence because he wants to provide a good example for his children.  \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant presented the testimony of one character witness, a co-\nworker who is a consulting engineer. He retired from the Navy after 30 years of service. \nHe has held access to classified information during most of his life and understands the \nimportance of protecting the nation\u2019s secrets. He considers Applicant to be a dedicated \nfamily man and a loyal American. As a whole, Applicant\u2019s character reference lauded his \ncompetence and his service to the United States. He would trust Applicant with his life. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe President of the United States has the authority to control access to \ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is \nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of \nDefense to grant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. \nSupreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in \nregulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of \nlaw. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and \npresent, favorable and unfavorable to reach his decision.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any expressed or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication that the Applicant has not met \nthe strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                           \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern about drug involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes eight conditions related to drug involvement that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Four drug involvement disqualifying \nconditions raise a security concern and are disqualifying in this particular case: AG \u00b6 \n25(a): \u201cany drug abuse;\u201d7 AG \u00b6 25(b): \u201ctesting positive for illegal drug use;\u201d AG \u00b6 25(d): \n\u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, \nor psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence;\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(g): \u201cany illegal drug \nuse after being granted a security clearance.\u201d \n \nApplicant illegally used marijuana daily from 1974 until 1987. He tested positive \nfor marijuana after a random drug test in 1987. He again used marijuana in 2008. He \nhas possessed a security clearance since around 1978 to present. Applicant has been \ndiagnosed as suffering from \u201calcohol dependence and cannabis dependence in \nremission by history.\u201d  \n  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides four potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n \n7  AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled \nSubstances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, \nand hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other similar substances. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation. \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nI find that none of the Guideline H mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s \nillegal use of marijuana spans a lengthy period of time \u2013 from 1974, until at least August \n2008. Considering the totality of the circumstances I find his use of marijuana is recent. \nApplicant has an addictive personality. He used marijuana in a daily basis from 1974 \nuntil 1987. He received non-judicial punishment in 1987, for his use of marijuana when \nhe was on active duty in the Navy, and while holding a security clearance. His access to \nSCI was terminated in 1988 because of his drug use. In 1995, he was given access to \nclassified information conditioned on his abstinence from alcohol and drugs. He again \nused marijuana in 2008. \n \nApplicant failed to disclose his drug use when he enlisted and he failed to \ndisclose the full extent of his drug use and alcohol-related behavior until 2008. Applicant \nknew from the beginning of his Navy career that his illegal drug use and alcohol-related \nbehavior would adversely impact his ability to enlist and later to serve in the Navy. \nApplicant participated in numerous substance abuse rehabilitation programs and was \ndiagnosed with alcohol dependence and cannabis dependence in remission by history. \nDuring his treatment, Applicant promised to abstain from alcohol and drugs. After his \nmandatory treatment ran its course, Applicant started using alcohol again and continued \nhis alcohol-related misconduct. Moreover, he used marijuana again in 2008, knowing full \nwell about the Government\u2019s security concerns regarding his use of drugs and the \nserious potential consequences of his actions with respect to his continued access to \nclassified information. \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) partially applies because he submitted a signed statement of intent \nwith automatic revocation of clearance for any \u201cabuse of drugs or alcohol.\u201d It applies in \npart, and does not fully mitigate the security concerns, because, considering the record \nas a whole, his drug use is recent and sufficient time has not passed for Applicant to \nestablish his ability and willingness to stop using illegal drugs. Applicant has a history of \nrelapsing after undergoing extensive counseling and rehabilitation treatment. Not \nenough time has passes for Applicant to establish his reliability, trustworthiness, and his \nability and willingness to comply with laws and regulations. Applicant\u2019s favorable \nevidence, at this time, is not sufficient to mitigate the Guideline H security concerns. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served honorably in the \nNavy, retired with disability, and has worked for a government contractor since 1999. He \nis a good husband and dedicated father. He held access to classified information at \ndifferent levels, for most of his 33 years of government service. There is no evidence \nthat he has ever compromised or caused others to compromise classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s character reference recommended without reservation that his access to \nclassified information be granted. These factors show some responsibility, good \njudgment, and mitigation. \n \nOn the other hand, the factors against granting Applicant\u2019s security clearance are \nmore substantial. Applicant\u2019s lengthy history of substance abuse, treatment, and \nrelapses, creates serious doubts on his rehabilitation and whether he has made \npermanent behavioral changes. Moreover, his reliability and trustworthiness is in \nquestion because he failed to disclose the full extent of his drug and alcohol related \nproblems in several security clearance applications. Applicant made inconsistent \nstatements about his marijuana consumption, and I did not find his statements at his \nhearing to be credible. His past behavior shows he does not have the ability or \nwillingness to comply with the law, rules, and regulations. Overall, the record evidence \nfails to convince me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e and 1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 9, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. DOHA acted under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDepartment of Defense on September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant initially answered the SOR on May 25, 2010, but failed to address all \nthe allegations. He submitted a second answer addressing all the SOR allegations on \nJune 18, 2010. He also initially requested an administrative determination, but \nsubsequently requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was \nApril 1, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \nassigned to me on November 2, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November \n17, 2010, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on November 30, 2010. The \nGovernment offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. Department Counsel\u2019s exhibit index is marked as Hearing Exhibit \n(HE) I. Applicant testified and submitted exhibits (AE) A through B that were admitted \ninto evidence at the hearing. The record was held open for Applicant to submit \nadditional information. Applicant submitted AE C, which was admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. Department Counsel\u2019s post-hearing memorandum was marked HE II. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 8, 2010.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \n \nApplicant was verbally notified by Department Counsel of the November 30, \n2010, hearing date prior to the issuance of the written notice of hearing dated November \n17, 2010. At hearing, I asked Applicant if he was ready to proceed and he stated that he \nwas ready.1 Applicant waived the 15-day notice requirement imposed by \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the \nDirective. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer for three years. He is an engineering technician. He also holds two \npart-time jobs. He has an associate\u2019s degree. He is single, never married and has no \nchildren.2  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts and falsification of his security clearance \napplication. The debts were listed on credit reports obtained on November 12, 2009, \nand October 28, 2008. In his answer, Applicant admitted owing eight debts and denied \nthree debts. He also denied making any knowingly false statements in his security \nclearance application.3  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began in 2003 when he was first laid off from his \njob. He was working for a contractor who lost the contract Applicant was working on \nwhich resulted in his layoff. During the years 2003 through 2008, Applicant was hired \nand laid off four additional times. Each layoff was caused by lack of work or loss of the \ncontract by the contractor. It was during this time frame that Applicant accumulated the \ndebts at issue. Since 2008 he has worked for his current employer with no further \nlayoffs.4  \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 11. \n \n2 Tr. at 29-31. \n \n3 GE 1-6. \n \n4 Tr. at 33-38. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn September 2010, Applicant contacted a credit counseling service to assist him \nwith paying his debts. Although he met with the service, prepared budget information, \nand talked about a payment plan, he did not hire the service. He stated that one of the \nobstacles to hiring the service was that he couldn\u2019t get a current credit report, which the \nservice needed before it could assist him with his debts. The Government had no \ntrouble obtaining his credit report. Evidently, he abandoned the idea of using a credit \ncounseling service because his post-hearing submission included a copy of his January \n2011, Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition filing. No further information was provided about \nthe status of the bankruptcy case.5  \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is a judgment resulting from a repossessed \nautomobile in the amount of $3,693. Applicant acknowledges this debt. It remains \nunpaid and unresolved.6 \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is a judgment resulting from another repossessed \nautomobile in the amount of $3,727. Applicant acknowledges this debt. It remains \nunpaid and unresolved.7   \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c is a judgment for $5,950. Applicant acknowledges \nthis debt. It remains unpaid and unresolved.8 \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is a medical collection debt for $220. Applicant \nacknowledges this debt. It remains unpaid and unresolved.9 \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e is a consumer collection debt for $691. Applicant \nacknowledges this debt. It remains unpaid and unresolved.10 \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f is a consumer collection debt for $1,167. Applicant \nacknowledges this debt. It remains unpaid and unresolved.11  \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g is a past due consumer debt of $90 on a balance \nof $552. Applicant disputes this debt, but provided no documentation to support his \ndispute. It remains unpaid and unresolved.12 \n                                                          \n5 Tr. at 78, GE 4-5; AE B-C. \n \n6 Tr. at 39-40; GE 4-5. \n \n7 Tr. at 41; GE 4-5. \n \n8 Tr. at 41-42; GE 4-5. \n \n9 Tr. at 43-44; GE 4-5. \n \n10 Tr. at 44; GE 4-5. \n \n11 Tr. at 45; GE 4-5. \n \n12 Tr. at 45-46; GE 4-5. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h is a judgment for $264.

It remains unpaid and unresolved.16 \n \n \nApplicant also presented evidence that he was paying on a non-SOR related \nstudent loan debt. Applicant\u2019s student loan document is titled, \u201cUS Department of \nEducation Debt Collection Bill,\u201d and showed a total balance owed of $18,217.17   \n \n \nThe personal conduct concern arises because of answers Applicant provided to \ntwo sections on his security clearance application. The SOR allegations state that he \nfalsified answers to his security clearance application (e-QIP) on October 18, 2008, by \nanswering \u201cno\u201d to the questions concerning whether he had any unpaid judgments \nagainst him in the last seven years, and whether he had in the last seven years been \nover 180 days delinquent on any debts or whether he was currently 90 days delinquent \non any debts. When asked directly about these answers, Applicant stated that he was \naware of the judgments and credit report information, but it did not dawn on him to list \nthat information. He further stated that he knew if he listed the information it might \n\u201cmess up my chances\u201d to get a job.18 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions that are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n                                                          \n13 Tr. at 46; GE 4-5. \n \n14 Tr. at 47-48; GE 4-5. \n \n15 Tr. at 48-49; GE 4-5. \n \n16 Tr. at 50-51; GE 4-5. \n \n17 AE A. \n \n18 Tr. at 53-54. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as \nfollows:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \n\n \n6 \n \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto satisfy his obligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n \n  \nSeveral Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent, numerous, and there is no indication that they will \nnot recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable.  \n \nApplicant experienced some personal setbacks because of job layoffs from 2003 \nthrough 2008. However, he has been gainfully employed by his current employer for \nthree years and works two part-time jobs. Despite his recent steady employment, he \nmade no effort to address his past due obligations. While his periods of unemployment \n\n \n7 \n \nwere conditions outside his control, he failed to act responsibly under the circumstances \nwhen he failed to address his debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable.  \n \n \nThe only evidence of financial counseling is Applicant\u2019s seeking assistance from \na credit counseling service that he later abandoned. Instead he sought Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy relief. Seeking Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief is not a good-faith effort to repay \nhis debts.19 AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant disputed the debt listed at SOR \u00b6 1.g. The debt appears on his credit \nreport and he failed to document the basis of his dispute. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable. \n \n \nAt this point, Applicant\u2019s finances remain a concern and the incomplete \nbankruptcy action provides no assistance to his cause. \n \nGUIDELINE E, PERSONAL CONDUCT \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire. \nApplicant\u2019s explanation for his false answers on his security clearance application \nis unpersuasive. He clearly was aware of his debts and judgments when he submitted \n                                                          \n19 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an \nApplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the Applicant\u2019s debts. The \nDirective does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan Applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations \nMitigating Condition 6.  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \n\n \n8 \n \nhis security clearance application and contemplated their effect on his job prospects \nprior to falsely answering the questions at issue. The questions on the application are \nunambiguous. I conclude from the evidence that Applicant deliberately provided false \ninformation concerning these questions. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies.   \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 17 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nThe record is absent any evidence that Applicant made any efforts to correct his \nfalse answers before being interviewed by an investigator. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. \nFalsification of material information on a security clearance application is a serious \noffense and calls into question Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and good judgment. AG \u00b6 \n17(c) does not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of \n\n \n9 \n \nthe factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant \nadditional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s years of service to his employer. I also considered his \nperiods of unemployment. Even though he recently filed for bankruptcy relief to address \nhis debts, he has not shown a track record of financial stability. Additionally, he \ndeliberately falsified his security clearance questionnaire. Therefore, he failed to provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The record shows Applicant has a\nhistory of financial problems or difficulties as evidenced by current and past collection\naccounts, a student loan collection account, and an unpaid judgment on which he has\nmade no payments since the judgment was entered in 2005. Sixteen delinquent debts\nfor about $16,000 remain unpaid. Although the student loan was rehabilitated and he\npaid three small collection accounts, the record contains insufficient evidence to explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Accordingly, as explained below, this case\nis decided against Applicant.\nJanuary 8, 2010\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines), which were made effective within the Defense Department on September\n1, 2006, apply to this case. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.\n Exhibit 1. \n2\n Tr. 8. \n3\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant on June 12, 2009. The SOR is similar to a complaint, and it detailed the\nfactual basis for the action under Guideline F for financial considerations. Also, the SOR\nrecommended submitting the case to an administrative judge for a determination\nwhether to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion, and he requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on August 5, 2009. The hearing took place September\n21, 2009. The record was left open until October 5, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit\nadditional documentary evidence. Applicant made a timely submission, and the post-\nhearing matters are marked and admitted, without objections, as follows: Exhibit\nE\u2013student loan documents (four pages); and Exhibit F\u2013two letters of recommendation.\nThe transcript (Tr.) was received September 29, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 31-year-old aircraft mechanic who is employed by federal\ncontractor.

In his answer, Applicant admitted 15 debts, denied\n5 debts, and provided some brief explanations. The debts, which are established by an\nOctober 2008 credit report,  include an unpaid judgment for $1,412 and a student loan\n4\naccount in collection for $14,730.

Sixteen delinquent debts for\nabout $16,000 remain unpaid. \nIn March 2009, Applicant applied for a consolidation loan via a credit card\naccount with a major bank in an effort to address his unpaid delinquent debts (Exhibit\nB). The bank denied his application due to his derogatory credit history (Exhibit 2). One\nmonth later, Applicant sought consumer counseling from a nonprofit organization, and\nthe counselor recommended consolidating the debts into a debt-management plan\nrequiring a $480 monthly payment, which was beyond Applicant\u2019s ability to pay (Exhibits\nB and 2). \nIn general, Applicant\u2019s plan is to save money in a separate account that he will\nuse to repay his delinquent debts. He believes this approach will work best as it will\nallow him to accumulate enough money to negotiate lump-sum settlements, paying off\nhis creditors one at a time. He attributes his financial problems to his divorce in 2002,\nand his periods of unemployment and unstable employment. He was able to make\nforward progress on resolving his financial problems since obtaining his current job in\nOctober 2007.  \n6\n\n Department of Navy v.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n16\n5\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n7\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n8\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n9\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n10\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n11\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n12\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n13\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n14\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.15\nThe Agency\u2019s appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.16\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n17\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n18\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 18.  \n19\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(a).  \n20\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(c). \n21\n6\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n17\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n18\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security\nconcern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under\nGuideline F is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n19\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \nThe record supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial\ndifficulties. This history raises concerns because it indicates inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of\n20\n21\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f) (setting forth six mitigating conditions). \n22\n7\nGuideline F. The facts are more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying\nconditions, and they suggest some financial irresponsibility as well.\nUnder \u00b6 20 of Guideline F, there are six conditions that may mitigate security\nconcerns.  Of the six conditions, three apply in Applicant\u2019s favor as follows: \n22\n(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; and \n(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nFirst, \u00b6 20(b) applies because Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties were largely due to\nhis divorce, his status as a single parent, and his periods of unemployment and\nunstable employment, all of which were circumstances largely beyond his control.\nSecond, \u00b6 20(c) applies because there are clear indications that Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems, while ongoing, are being resolved, which will take time. And third, \u00b6 20(d)\napplies because Applicant has made some progress in resolving his delinquent\nindebtedness. Most significantly, he rehabilitated the student loan collection account by\nmaking several monthly payments resulting in repurchase of the account by Sallie Mae.\nHe also paid three small collection accounts, and he has a general plan to address his\nother debts. Given these circumstances, I conclude Applicant initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAlthough Applicant deserves credit for his efforts, the credit in mitigation is\ninsufficient to overcome the security concerns raised by his history of financial\ndifficulties. His history includes current and past collection accounts, a defaulted student\nloan account, and an unpaid judgment on which he has made no payments since the\njudgment was entered in 2005. Sixteen delinquent debts for about $16,000 remain\nunpaid. Looking forward, based on his limited track record of repayment, it is too soon\nto tell if Applicant will resolve his delinquent debts in the near future and if additional\nfinancial problems will not recur. \nTo conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s history of\nfinancial difficulties create current doubts about his judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. He did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nthe security concerns. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due consideration to the nine-\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n23\n Exhibit F. \n24\n8\nfactor whole-person concept  and Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence, including his\n23\nfavorable character references.  Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of\n24\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided against\nApplicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations, as required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of\nEnclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j, 1.k, 1.I, and 1.p: \nFor Applicant\nRemaining Subparagraphs:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant has an associate\u2019s degree in drafting, and is currently working toward a bachelor\u2019s degree in facility management. (Tr. 19).

To\ndate, he has made minimal progress toward its satisfaction. Applicant has failed to\nmitigate the security concern. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nOn May 28, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing a security concern under Guideline\nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nDecember 10, 2009\n\n2\nDOHA received Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR on June 30, 2009, admitting all of\nthe allegations except SOR subparagraphs 1.b and 1.c. The case was assigned to me\non August 31, 2009. On September 10, 2009, a notice of hearing was issued scheduling\nthe case for September 25, 2009. Applicant waived his right to 15 days notice of hearing\nand the hearing was conducted as scheduled. (Tr. 8). I received four government\nexhibits, two Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. At Applicant\u2019s request, I left\nthe record open to allow him to submit additional documentation. Within the time\nallotted, he submitted three additional exhibits that I incorporated into the record. The\ntranscript was received on October 2, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 48-year-old man who has been married for eight years. A previous\nmarriage ended in the divorce in the late 1990s. Applicant has two children from his first\nmarriage, ages 18 and 16, and two children from his current marriage, ages seven and\nsix. \nApplicant has an associate\u2019s degree in drafting, and is currently working toward a\nbachelor\u2019s degree in facility management. (Tr. 19). He has been working for a defense\ncontractor as a facility manager for the past 18 months (Government Exhibit (GE) 1 at\n4). His job duties include, among other things, developing software that enables facility\nmanagers to \u201cmanage the facility correctly by square footage, personnel, who\u2019s renting\n[and] all the telecom equipment\u201d (Tr. 39).\nApplicant served in the U.S. Army from 1980 to 1992 (Tr. 19). During this period,\nhe served honorably in four overseas combat theaters, and he earned multiple awards\nincluding five Army Achievement Medals and a National Defense Ribbon (Tr. 21).\nWhen Applicant left the Army, he found employment with what was then a small\nInternet services provider (Tr. 86). In the nine years Applicant worked there, it grew into\none of the largest companies in the world (Tr. 88). As the company grew, Applicant\u2019s\nincome grew. By 2001, he was earning more than $200,000 per year (Tr. 88). His\nincome enabled him to buy two homes without financing (Tr. 89). When Applicant and\nhis first wife divorced, he agreed to give her one of the homes instead of paying child\nsupport (Tr. 93).\nDuring 2001, Applicant\u2019s mother grew seriously ill. In approximately May 2001,\nhe quit his job, sold his remaining house, and relocated to Puerto Rico to care for her\n(GE 1 at 3; Tr. 23). \nWhen Applicant left his job, he held stock in his former employer\u2019s company in\nexcess of $170,000 (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A at 3). He supported himself with this\nstock for the next five years (Tr. 86). He also used this income to pay for his mother\u2019s\nmedical care (Tr. 96). Although he was born and raised in Puerto Rico, his Spanish-\nspeaking skills had diminished over the years (Tr. 96). This hampered his ability to\n\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance application does not list any employment gaps. During cross-examination, he\n1\nadmitted falsifying his employment history because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to show unemployment\u201d (Tr. 53).\n3\nmaintain steady employment. By 2005, Applicant had depleted his investment income\n(Tr. 97). He then used credit cards to support his family (Tr. 97).\nIn January 2006, he obtained a job on the U.S. mainland and relocated to a\nrental property (GE 1 at 5). Later that year, Applicant attempted to buy a rental property\n(Tr. 106). He then discovered a $15,300 state tax lien from tax year 2001 on his credit\nreport (SOR subparagraph 1.a). He testified that the state, by billing him for all of tax\nyear 2001, overtaxed him because he only lived in the state for \u201ca couple of months\u201d\nthat year before moving to Puerto Rico (Tr. 109 112). However, on his security\nclearance application, he indicated that he lived in the state through all of 2001 before\nmoving to Puerto Rico (GE 1 at 3).\nShortly after discovering the state tax lien in 2006, Applicant contacted a\nrepresentative from the state tax department to resolve the tax dispute (Tr. 109). The\nrepresentative asked him to submit proof supporting his contention that he did not live in\nthe state for all of tax year 2001 (Tr. 109). Approximately a month after talking to the tax\nrepresentative, Applicant lost his job  (Tr. 109). He then decided to \u201ctake care of [his]\n1\nfamily and . . . pay nothing\u201d (Tr. 109).\nApplicant filed his 2001 federal income tax return timely but incorrectly, resulting\nin an outstanding tax deficiency (Tr. 112). By October 2008, this tax deficiency had\nincreased to approximately $8,800, as alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.k (Answer; Tr.\n112).\nThis past year, Applicant renewed his efforts to resolve the state tax delinquency\nand began taking steps to resolve the federal tax delinquency (Tr. 23; 109-112). By May\n2009, he had filed an amended federal tax return and arranged a payment plan to\nsatisfy the IRS delinquency (AE B). Since June 2009, he has been paying the IRS $215\nmonthly under the plan (AE B at 2; AE D-E). According to a representative from the\nstate taxing authority where Applicant lived in 2001, he needs to submit a copy of his\noriginal federal 2001 tax return along with a copy of the amended one. Also, the state\ntaxing agency representative reiterated that he needs to submit proof supporting his\ncontention that he did not live in the state for all of 2001 (Tr. 28). The state taxing\nauthority will then re-calculate the amount he owes (Tr. 25).\nApplicant has not yet received a copy of his original 2001 federal tax return from\nthe IRS. Also, he has yet to submit documentation supporting his contention that he did\nnot live in the state for all of 2001. The state tax delinquency remains outstanding (Tr.\n25, 29).\nSOR subparagraph 1.b is a delinquent electric bill, for approximately $2,000,\nfrom Applicant\u2019s residence in Puerto Rico (Tr. 29). Applicant contests this bill. He\ncontends that the date-of-usage listed on the bill (2006-2008) does not correspond to\n\n4\nthe period when he lived in Puerto Rico (Tr. 29; 111). Applicant has called the utility\ncompany several times (Tr. 111). His efforts to resolve this dispute have been\nunsuccessful, and he has no plans of paying the delinquency (Tr. 112). He presented\nno documentary evidence to show he has formally disputed this account.\nSOR subparagraph 1.c is a delinquency owed to a cell phone company for $127.\nApplicant opened the account in 2007, then closed it because of dissatisfaction with\nservice area coverage (Tr. 31). Applicant contends the company returned his deposit in\nfull when he closed the account, and that he owes them nothing (Tr. 31). Also, he\ncontends that he disputed it online (Tr. 31). He provided no evidence substantiating his\ndispute.\nSOR subparagraphs 1.d through 1.i alleged delinquent medical bills Applicant\naccrued in 2006, when he and his daughter suffered severe ear infections that required\nhospitalization (Tr. 32-34). He had no health insurance when these bills accrued (Tr.\n65). Applicant has not begun paying these delinquencies, and has not contacted the\ncreditors (Tr. 69). He will begin paying them after he satisfies the bigger delinquencies\n(Tr. 33-34, 69). Collectively, they total approximately $1,400.\nSOR subparagraph 1.j is a debt owed to an auto insurance company for $121\n(GE 2 at 9). Applicant used this insurance carrier through March 2006 before switching\nto another insurance carrier (GE 2 at 9). The delinquent amount represents the amount\ndue from the final month of service. Applicant believed he had paid this creditor \u201cfree\nand clear\u201d when he switched insurance carriers (Tr. 36). Currently, he has made no\nsteps to resolve it.\nApplicant has not received any financial counseling (Tr. 64). He maintains a\nbudget (GE 2 at 10). Depending on the price of gasoline and the amount of money he\nspends to help his wife satisfy one of her credit card debts, he has between $300 and\n$500 of monthly disposable income (Id.; Tr. 78-82, 102). Applicant anticipates receiving\na large bonus at the end of the year (AE C; Tr. 73). He intends to apply it to his\ndelinquent debts.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief, introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\n\n5\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d Applicant\nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s history of financial delinquencies triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6\n19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.\u201d\nBetween 2001 and 2008, Applicant accrued approximately $28,000 of delinquent\ndebt. Nearly all remain currently outstanding. AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment,\u201d does not apply.\nApplicant contends that his largest delinquency, the 2001 state tax debt, accrued\nbecause the state erroneously billed him for an entire year when he lived in the state for\ntwo months. Applicant indicated on his security clearance application; however, that he\nlived in the state for all of 2001. Applicant also contends that the SOR debts incurred\nafter 2006 grew delinquent because of a lengthy unemployment period. Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity clearance application, however, reflects no unemployment period, and at the\nhearing, Applicant admitted falsifying his security clearance application because he did\nnot want to show unemployment periods. \nApplicant\u2019s lack of credibility undermines the probative value of his explanations\nconcerning any of the SOR allegations that he disputed. His admitted falsification of his\nemployment history, in particular, undermines his contention that unemployment\ncontributed to his financial difficulties. Neither AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce,\n\n6\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d nor AG \u00b6\n20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due\ndebt which is the cause of the problem, and provides documented proof to substantiate\nthe basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,\u201d apply.\nApplicant contacted the IRS and made payment arrangements to resolve his\nfederal income tax delinquency. Since June 2009, he has steadily made monthly\npayments consistent with the plan. AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d applies in part.\nApplicant, however, has not begun satisfying any of the other delinquencies, nor\nhas he participated in any financial counseling. Instead, his long-term plan to eliminate\nhis delinquencies is predicated on a bonus he anticipates receiving. AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or under control\u201d does not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nAlthough Applicant has recently begun paying one of his delinquent debts, he still\nhas approximately $26,000 of delinquent debt that remains outstanding. Applicant\ncontends that he will begin satisfying the smaller delinquencies after he satisfies the\nstate and federal tax delinquencies. Without a demonstrated track record of financial\nreform, Applicant\u2019s projected plan has minimal probative value.\nIn assessing Applicant\u2019s security-clearance worthiness, I was troubled by\ninconsistencies between his testimony and information he provided on his security\nclearance application. This lack of credibility undercuts his contention that he will satisfy\nhis delinquencies. Upon evaluating this case in the context of the whole person concept,\nI conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concern. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

This is her first application for a security clearance. She is married, but pending divorce, and has no children. She graduated from high school as a member of the National Honor Society, and attended a community college for three years from 1998 to 2001. In her responses to the SOR, 5 she denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.j, and 1.k, and admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.i, 1.l, and 1.m.

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant incurred 12 delinquent debts, totaling more than $70,500, since 2007.\nShe provided no evidence of any effort to resolve any of those debts, despite\nexpressing her intention to do so more than two years ago. She failed to mitigate the\nresulting security concerns. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and\nexhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on June 20, 2008.1\nOn December 4, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations).  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\n2\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nOctober 13, 2010\n\nItems 4 and 6.\n3\nThe Government submitted ten Items in support of the SOR allegations.\n4\nItems 4 and 7.\n5\nItems 4 and 6.\n6\nItems 4, 8, 9, and 10.\n7\n2\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued\nafter September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 7, 2010, and again on\nFebruary 19, 2010, and requested that her case be decided by an administrative judge\non the written record without a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the\n3\nGovernment\u2019s written case on March 4, 2010. A complete copy of the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and she was afforded an opportunity to file\n4\nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of\nher receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of her copy of the FORM\non March 17, 2010, and returned it to DOHA. She provided no further response to the\nFORM within the 30-day period, did not request additional time to respond, and made\nno objection to consideration of any evidence submitted by Department Counsel. I\nreceived the case assignment on July 7, 2010.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where she was\nhired in April 2008. She has no military service. This is her first application for a security\nclearance. She is married, but pending divorce, and has no children. She graduated\nfrom high school as a member of the National Honor Society, and attended a\ncommunity college for three years from 1998 to 2001.  In her responses to the SOR,\n5\nshe denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.j, and 1.k, and admitted the\nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.i, 1.l, and 1.m. Applicant\u2019s admissions, including her\nresponses to the SOR, and to DOHA interrogatories, are incorporated in the following\nfindings.\nApplicant admitted owing each of the eight delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d\nthrough 1.i, 1.l, and 1.m, totaling $34,927.  Although she formally denied the debts\n6\nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.k, she admitted that she was the sole responsible\ndebtor for each, and each of these debts continues to be reported on her record credit\nreports.  She offered no evidence to substantiate any resolution of these debts, which\n7\ntotal an additional $36,242. Her record credit reports reflect a zero balance due on her\nfirst mortgage loan for $132,000, which is alleged to be delinquent in SOR \u00b6 1.j.\n\nFORM at 5.\n8\nItems 4, 7, 9, and10.\n9\nItem 4, Item 8 at 24, 26, Item 9.\n10\nItem 8 at 9, 13, 26.\n11\n3\nDepartment Counsel conceded that this allegation appeared to be in error, and that the\ncreditor\u2019s January 2008 initiation of foreclosure proceedings appears to have resolved\nany ongoing debt, as claimed by Applicant.  Excluding the mortgage debt alleged in\n8\nSOR \u00b6 1.j, the record evidence establishes that Applicant owes 12 delinquent debts\ntotaling $70,539. All of these debts became delinquent in 2007 or 2008, after she was\nlaid off from her job as an office manager for a mortgage company and moved to\nanother state where she worked as a cashier.  She neither documented, nor claimed to\n9\nhave completed, arrangements to repay any of these debts. \nOn September 4, 2009, Applicant filed for divorce from her husband, whom she\nvaguely blamed for some of her financial difficulties. The petition sought incorporation of\na Property Settlement Agreement which they entered into on May 3, 2007. Applicant did\nnot provide a copy of that agreement, but told the investigator from the Office of\nPersonnel Management who interviewed her on August 14, 2008, that she did not\nintend to request that her husband be awarded responsibility for any of the debts\ndiscussed above. She also told the investigator that she had moved in with her parents\nin April 2008 to minimize living expenses while she resolved her delinquent debts, which\nshe intended to do promptly. As noted above, she offered no evidence of any attempt to\nresolve any of these debts, all of which remained on her credit report dated August 12,\n2009.  \n10\nApplicant provided no evidence of financial counseling, or of any basis to dispute\nthe legitimacy of any of the aforementioned delinquent debts. The only budget\ninformation she provided, from which to determine her present or future solvency,\nconsisted of undocumented estimates on a personal financial statement showing a\nmonthly surplus of $129, submitted with her interrogatory response dated May 21, 2009.\nThis budget reflected a $50 monthly payment toward the delinquent debt alleged in\nSOR \u00b6 1.h, but no other payment toward her delinquent debts. She has virtually no\nsavings from which to address her obligations.  \n11\nApplicant submitted no other evidence describing her character, trustworthiness,\nor work performance. Department Counsel pointed out her lack of documentation\nconcerning any form of debt resolution in the Argument section of the FORM, and\nidentified the need for her to submit such documentation to establish mitigation.\nApplicant failed to respond to the FORM with any additional information. I was unable to\nevaluate her credibility, demeanor, or character in person since she elected to have her\ncase decided without a hearing.\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions (DCs) and mitigating conditions (MCs), which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n\nFORM at 5.\n12\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nDepartment Counsel argued that the evidence established security concerns\nunder two Guideline F DCs, as set forth in AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n12\nApplicant has been unable or unwilling to satisfy 12 delinquent debts, totaling\nmore than $70,500, which arose during 2007 and 2008. DC 19(a) and (c) were clearly\nestablished, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate the\nresulting security concerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; and \n\nItem 8 at 24, Item 7 at 13-19.\n13\nISCR Case No. 06-12930 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2008) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2-3 (App.\n14\nBd. Jul. 6, 2006)). \n6\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nApplicant\u2019s financial concerns involve 12 different accounts, span the past three\nyears, and continue to date, with no documentation of any effective steps toward\nresolution. She did not demonstrate that these obligations will be resolved anytime\nsoon, or that she can avoid additional delinquencies in the future. The evidence does\nnot support the application of MC 20(a). \nApplicant was underemployed for some of the time since 2007, but she provided\nno evidence tending to show that the causes of this underemployment were largely\nbeyond her control. She also made no showing that the debts she incurred arose from\nconditions that were beyond her control. She told the OPM investigator that she was\nunemployed for two months in 2007, but her SF 86 reflected continuous employment\ndating back to May 2003.  Finally, she provided nothing to substantiate that she acted\n13\nresponsibly under the circumstances, so very limited mitigation under MC 20(b) was\nestablished.\nApplicant documented no financial counseling, and provided insufficient evidence\nof a good-faith effort to resolve her outstanding debts. On the present record, Applicant\nfailed to establish mitigation under MC 20(c) or MC 20(d). \u201cAn applicant is not required\nto show that she has completely paid off her indebtedness, only that she has\nestablished a reasonable plan to resolve her debts and has taken significant actions to\nimplement that plan.\u201d  Applicant failed to meet her burden in this regard.\n14\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n7\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.     \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature,\neducated, and experienced individual, who is responsible for her voluntary choices and\nconduct that underlie the security concerns expressed in the SOR. Her financial\nirresponsibility spans the past three years, and continues at present from all indications\nin the record. She demonstrated little effective effort to resolve her debts since gaining\nher current employment more than two years ago. She remains subject to coercion and\nduress from her financial obligations, and made no showing that such problems are\nunlikely to continue or recur. \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.k through 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He took over responsibility for the family\nfinances in 2009, and implemented reasonable plans to resolve the debts. His former\nwife\u2019s failure to meet her financial obligations after their divorce caused his efforts in this\nregard to become untenable, and he ultimately had to file for bankruptcy relief. He has\ndone so, and has both the means and every intention to remain solvent in the future. He\nis a responsible and trustworthy individual, and met his burden to mitigate security\nconcerns arising from his financial situation. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted. \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on August 27, 2008.\nOn October 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nOctober 29, 2010\n\nTranscript (Tr.) 11-15.\n1\nTr. 7-8, 31-32; GE 1; AE C.\n2\nAR.\n3\nGE 3.\n4\n2\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\nthat went into effect within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (AR) on November 21, 2009, and\nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared\nto proceed on December 18, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on May 14, 2010.\nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on July 8, 2010, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on August 2, 2010. Due to unexplained mail delays, Applicant did not receive\nthe Notice of Hearing until July 27, 2010. After an explanation of his right to at least 15\ndays of notice before his hearing, Applicant stated that he had sufficient time to prepare,\nwanted to proceed with the hearing as scheduled, and waived the 15-day notice period.1\nThe Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were admitted without\nobjection. Applicant offered exhibits (AE) A through E, which were admitted without\nobjection, and testified on his own behalf. His supervisor also testified. I granted\nApplicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until August 16, 2010, for submission of\nadditional evidence. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 10,\n2010. Applicant submitted no further evidence, and the record was closed as\nscheduled. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he has\nworked since September 2002. Before that, he served three years of active duty in the\nAir Force. He has held a security clearance since 1999, without incident. He is recently\ndivorced, with one child of whom he is the custodial parent.  In his response to the\n2\nSOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, with\nexplanations.   Applicant\u2019s admissions, including his statements in response to DOHA\n3\ninterrogatories,  are incorporated in the following findings.\n4\nApplicant and his then-girlfriend broke up during the fall of 2004. His financial\nsituation at the time was good, and he purchased a condominium to live in. He had also\nrecently purchased a new car. In early 2005, his girlfriend told him that she was\npregnant with his child, and they decided to marry so their child would have a two-\nparent home. They combined their finances, including some outstanding delinquencies\nof his wife\u2019s that he did not previously know about. Their son was born in July 2005.\nSince his wife was an accountant, he agreed to her request that she manage the family\nfinances. Without his knowledge, she began to spend more than they earned on a\nregular basis, and neglected some of their bills. In 2006, Applicant was notified that his\n\nTr. 48-51; AE A..\n5\nTr. 48-54, 64-68; AR; AE A; AE B.\n6\nTr. 58-64, 71; AR; AE A.\n7\n3\nmortgage was six months delinquent and the lender was considering foreclosure. He\nwithdrew $15,000 from his 401K retirement savings to bring the mortgage and some\nother debts current, but others remained outstanding.5\nIn  2007, Applicant\u2019s wife injured her back during a fall in a parking lot. This injury\ncaused her to miss a significant amount of work, and resulted in substantial medical bills\nincluding, eventually, for neck surgery in October 2008. Applicant\u2019s wife remained in\ncharge of their finances and told him she was taking care of the bills. However, they fell\nbehind on his mortgage again, as well as other bills. In September 2008, Applicant\nentered into an agreement with his mortgage lender to repay the arrearage by\nincreasing his monthly payment by $402 per month for three years. He made those\npayments as long as he could, while also actively negotiating a loan modification\nagreement that was successfully finalized in April 2010.  \n6\nApplicant\u2019s wife began abusing prescription pain medication after her injury,\nfurther worsening their financial problems. In May 2009, he finally informed her that he\nwas going to take over the family finances, and he entered into a debt management\nplan with an accredited, non-profit, reputable consumer credit counseling service. The\nplan called for him to pay $403 per month to the service, who would then negotiate\nrepayment arrangements with his creditors. The plan called for resolution of almost\n$12,000 in delinquent debt, including those alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d, by July\n2012. Applicant paid a total of $4,498 into the debt management plan, including $50 for\na financial education course he was required to attend as part of the program. The\ncompany kept about $310 in fees, and paid the remaining funds to his various creditors.\nApplicant\u2019s mortgage loan was not included in this plan.7\nApplicant\u2019s wife did not react well to his decision to take over their finances.\nAmong other things, in early June 2009, she smashed in the windshield of his car and\nassaulted him. She locked their son in the house and left for periods of time. On June\n19, 2009, Applicant was granted a domestic violence protective order against his wife,\nwhich also granted him temporary custody of their son. He filed for divorce on\nNovember 6, 2009. The divorce became final on May 17, 2010, and Applicant was\nawarded custody of their son and child support from his wife in the amount of $597 per\nmonth beginning November 1, 2009. Applicant was awarded possession of his home,\ntogether with the mortgage debt thereon, as well as his car and its associated loan. He\nwas also awarded a portion of the couple\u2019s remaining debt, including one half of their\nfederal income tax delinquencies from 2007 through 2009 of $11,657. This tax debt was\nincurred due to penalties for early withdrawals from retirement plans and under\nwithholding by Applicant\u2019s wife to acquire additional funds during those years. Applicant\nhas entered into an agreed repayment plan with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and\npays $161 per month toward this tax debt, which he intends to increase when his son\n\nTr. 56-58, 68-76, 82-83, 92-98.\n8\nTr. 68-76; AE C.\n9\nTr. 76-83; AR; GE 3; AE D.\n10\nTr. 38-46; AE E.\n11\nTr. 87, 91.\n12\n4\nenters school in the fall of 2010 causing his $810 monthly child care expenses to be cut\nby at least $400 per month.  \n8\nApplicant\u2019s wife has not paid him any of the court-ordered child support to date.\nOn July 26, 2010, the court modified its withholding order to $826 per month to begin\nmaking up the arrearage. Despite the fact that she continues working, she also failed to\nmake her required payments on the loan for the car that was awarded to her in their\ndivorce. The car was subsequently repossessed in June 2010, and auctioned off\nleaving a deficiency balance of $11,000 for which Applicant is jointly liable to the\ncreditor.  \n9\nApplicant has long resisted advice from others that he seek bankruptcy relief,\nbecause he wanted to repay his debts. He initially consulted a bankruptcy attorney in\nMay 2009, but decided to enter the debt management plan instead for that reason.\nHowever, with his wife\u2019s ongoing refusal to pay child support or the other marital debts\nfor which she was awarded responsibility in the divorce decree, Applicant realized he\nhad no other reasonable option. He met with the bankruptcy attorney again on May 14,\n2010, and decided to file for Chapter 7 relief. On July 29, 2010, he finished paying the\nlegal fees, and the attorney filed the bankruptcy case for him on that date. Applicant has\nabout $36,000 in unsecured debt that will be discharged, leaving him with only his\nrenegotiated mortgage payments, the remaining payments on his own car loan, his\nagreed IRS tax repayments, and his regular living expenses going forward. His current\nbudget reflects a $207 monthly surplus, not including the pending $400 reduction in\nchildcare expenses, and not including any income from child support that he is due.  \n10\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified and wrote a letter describing his extremely high\nopinion of Applicant\u2019s dedication, reliability, trustworthiness, maturity, and ability to\nfollow and enforce security protocols. The supervisor, a retired master sergeant, has\nknown and supervised Applicant for eleven years while working in a precision\nmeasurement equipment laboratory.  Applicant received an early promotion from E-3 to\n11\nE-4 while in the Air Force, and has been selected as Employee of the Quarter and\nEmployee of the Month several times. He was extremely credible, organized, and well\ninformed about his financial situation during the hearing. Department Counsel fairly\ncommented that, \u201che\u2019s acted very, very reasonably [and] done whatever is in his power\nto mitigate and extenuate the Government\u2019s concerns.\u201d  \n12\n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions (DCs) and mitigating conditions (MCs), which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe evidence raised security concerns under two Guideline F DCs, as set forth in\nAG \u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u00b6 19(c) \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt stretches back\nmore than four years, and continues, in part, at present. The burden accordingly shifts\nto Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate or mitigate these facts and the resulting\nsecurity concerns.\nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial problems:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; and\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent indebtedness is ongoing, but arose due to his marriage to,\nand trust in, a woman who badly mismanaged their family finances despite being an\naccountant. The problems were further exacerbated by her addiction to prescription\npain medication. Appellant made reasonable efforts to convince her to be more\nresponsible while trying to keep their marriage together. He finally took personal control\n\nISCR Case No. 06-12930 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2008) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2-3 (App.\n13\nBd. Jul. 6, 2006)). \n7\nof their finances, causing her to assault and leave him. He divorced her, and has\nsurplus income again. He therefore established substantial mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a)\nbecause his debts arose under circumstances that are unlikely to recur and do not cast\ndoubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nPartial mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) was also established. Applicant\u2019s\ndelinquencies were initially incurred by his wife without his knowledge, and worsened by\nher 2007 injury and her resulting inability to work, surgery, and drug addiction. He finally\ndivorced her in order to begin correcting the problems, but her failure to pay court-\nordered child support or her allocated portion of their marital debt made his continuing\neffort to repay his creditors through his debt management plan impossible. Applicant\nhas acted responsibly throughout these problems, and has filed for bankruptcy relief as\na last resort to resolve his unsecured debts. He successfully renegotiated his mortgage\nloan terms, and is fully current in paying his regular living expenses. He is also\ncomplying with his IRS repayment agreement, and plans to substantially increase those\nmonthly payments once his child care expenses permit. Thus, additional mitigation was\nestablished under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and (d).  \nAs the Appeal Board has ruled concerning the successful mitigation of security\nconcerns arising from financial considerations, \u201c[a]n applicant is not required to show\nthat [he] has completely paid off [his] indebtedness, only that [he] has established a\nreasonable plan to resolve [his] debts and has \u2018taken significant actions to implement\nthat plan.\u2019\u201d  This applicant has established and substantially implemented an effective\n13\nplan to resolve the debts that could formerly have given rise to security concerns. He\nalso demonstrated his commitment to avoiding future financial problems, and a solvent\nbudget that will permit him to do so.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n8\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant incurred a moderate\namount of delinquent debt, primarily because of his wife\u2019s mismanagement of their\nfamily finances while he trusted her to handle them. Once he determined that she was\nnot going to become responsible, he took positive and effective actions to get the\nproblems under control and address the debts. Due to his wife\u2019s continuing failure to\nmeet her obligations, Applicant\u2019s attempt to repay his creditors through a reasonable\ndebt management plan became impossible. He accordingly followed the advice of his\nattorney and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief. He also successfully renegotiated his\nmortgage loan and an IRS repayment plan, both of which he does, and will continue to\nbe able to, pay on time. He is a mature and responsible individual, and recurrence of\nfinancial problems is quite unlikely. His proactive efforts to achieve resolution of his\ndebts have eliminated any ongoing potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress. \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial confidence as to Applicant\u2019s\npresent eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He fully met his burden to\nmitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 27, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested that his case be decided on the written record.  On July 29, 2009, after the close of the\nrecord, Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision.\nSome of Applicant\u2019s assertions on appeal rely on matters not contained in the record below.\nAs such, the assertions are based on new evidence.  The Board cannot consider new evidence on\nappeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nThe Judge found that Applicant owed the two delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  She found\nthat the first debt was to a telephone company in the amount of $189, and was in collection status\nat the time of the close of the record.  The Judge found that Applicant admitted that he owed the\nInternal Revenue Service $664,401 in the form of a tax lien for past due liabilities for the tax years\n1982 through 1994 and other federal taxes for the tax years 1995, 1996 and 2001.  The Judge found\nthat Applicant entered into an Offer in Compromise (OIC) with the IRS in August 2004.  Applicant\nclaimed that the tax lien debt was reduced in accordance with the OIC to $63,179.  The Judge found\nthat a payment schedule was set up, but Applicant lost his job in February 2005 and ceased making\npayments on the tax lien in July 2005.  The Judge noted that Applicant claimed that the IRS had\napplied refunds to the outstanding amount of the OIC, and he purportedly owed $4,478 as of April\n2008.  Without making a more specific finding, the Judge found that the $4,478 figure represented\nonly the balance owed for tax year 1996 and did not represent the entirety of Applicant\u2019s unpaid\nbalance owed to the IRS.  She found that there was no explanation for why Applicant failed to pay\nhis taxes on time for a period of 16 years.  The Judge referenced documents submitted by Applicant,\ndated June 5, 2009, indicating that the $664,401 tax lien was released.  The Judge noted that\nApplicant did not provide an explanation as to what actions he took to obtain the release, how much\nhe paid on the lien, when he paid it, or how he obtained the funds to pay it.  \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s two delinquent debts were of security significance,\nalthough she concluded that the telephone company debt was mitigated.  She noted that Applicant\nprovided no information that he attempted to take any action on the tax lien until 2004, and that he\nprovided no explanation as to why he failed to pay his taxes for 16 years.  The Judge further noted\nthat Applicant failed to provide information as to the status of the OIC after he stopped making\npromised monthly payments, failed to provide information as to how he obtained the release of the\nlien, and failed to show how much he may have paid on the remaining debt.  Overall, the tax debt\nwas not mitigated because Applicant did not provide enough evidence to explain the circumstances\nof the large debt or the reasons he failed to pay his taxes.         \nApplicant argues that he never admitted that he owed the IRS $664,401.  He says that as of\nJune 2009, he has no better understanding of why the IRS advised him that he no longer owed taxes\nthan he does of the original lien figure of $664,401.  He also argues that he has never failed to live\nwithin his means and that he satisfied the IRS obligation to the best of his ability and apparently to\nthe satisfaction of the IRS.  These assertions do not establish error on the part of the Judge.\nApplicant\u2019s denial that he admitted he owed the amount of the IRS tax lien is proffered for\nthe first time on appeal.  The Board has reviewed Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR and his\nsubmissions to the record, and concludes that nothing in Applicant\u2019s statements in the record can be\nreasonably construed as a denial of the allegation that he owed the IRS $664,401.  The Board has\nalso reviewed the totality of the record evidence and concludes that there is sufficient record\n\nevidence to support the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant owed the amount stated in the IRS tax lien.\nThe gravamen of the Judge\u2019s decision is that, given the establishment of the debt to the IRS,\nthere is insufficient evidence to mitigate the government\u2019s concerns because of Applicant\u2019s failure\nto explain adequately the circumstances of the debt, the reasons behind Applicant\u2019s failure to address\nhis tax delinquencies until 2004, and the circumstances surrounding the release of the tax lien.  There\nis no presumption of error below.  Given the paucity of evidence in this record that addresses the\nJudge\u2019s stated concerns, her ultimate adverse security decision and the analysis articulated in support\nof it are sustainable.\n After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Prior to then, he was employed from 1998 to 2005 for a private company. Applicant is a college graduate. He was married in 1964 and lists that he was divorced in 2004.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn March 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 16, 2009, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nfile of relevant material (FORM) on May 19, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on May \n \n1 \n \n \nJuly 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \n27, 2009. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not object to the FORM and \nsubmitted additional material dated June 19, 2009. Department Counsel did not object. \nThe case was assigned to me on June 25, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b and denied the allegation in \u00b6 1.a. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 65 years old and has been employed by a defense contractor since \nNovember 2005. He was unemployed from February 2005 until November 2005. Prior \nto then, he was employed from 1998 to 2005 for a private company. Applicant is a \ncollege graduate. He was married in 1964 and lists that he was divorced in 2004. \nHowever, he also lists that he remarried in 1997, which would be prior to his divorce.1 \n \n \nThere are two debts listed in the SOR. Applicant disputes a debt owed in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a to a telephone company ($189) that is now in collection status. He was unhappy \nwith the telephone service and terminated the contract. Although he states in his answer \nto the SOR that he has provided correspondence to the company advising them of the \ndispute, he failed to include this documentation to substantiate his claim. He stated it is \na matter of principle that he has not paid his account. He disputed the debt on his credit \nreport.2 \n \n \nApplicant admitted he owed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $664,401.23 for \na tax lien. It appears the tax lien is for liabilities for tax years 1982 through 1994 and \nother federal taxes for tax years 1995, 1996 and 2001. Applicant stated that the tax \nliens were for \u201cpenalties and interest that were greater than any actual tax due and were \nthe result of a period of self-employment.\u201d3  \n \n \nApplicant entered into an Offer in Compromise (OIC) with the IRS in August \n2004. He claimed that the debt was reduced in accordance with the OIC to $63,179. He \nwas to pay $10,000 within 90 days and then pay $1,829.47 a month for 40 months. \nApplicant lost his job in February 2005 and ceased making payments in July 2005. \nApplicant provided statements from the IRS, which indicated that a refund was owed to \nhim for tax year 2007. That refund was applied to back taxes owed by Applicant for tax \nyears 1996 ($926) and 2001 ($518.78). Applicant stated in his answer to the SOR the \nfollowing: \u201cIRS has applied refunds to the amount due and shows me to owe $4,478.42 \n \n1 Item 4. Applicant may have incorrectly listed the requested information on his Security \nClearance Application. I am unable to determine the accuracy of these dates. I have not considered this \ninformation for disqualifying purposes.  \n \n2 Item 3.  \n \n3 Item 3. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nas of April 21, 2008.\u201d4 However, according to the documents submitted by Applicant \nfrom the IRS, this is the balance owed for tax year 1996 and does not represent the \nentirety of Applicant\u2019s unpaid balance owed to the IRS.  \n \n \nApplicant notes in his answer that he filed his 2008 taxes and was due a refund \nof $645 that was to be applied to his outstanding tax lien. He also stated that \u201call tax \nreturns have been filed on a timely basis for several years.\u201d It is unclear whether \nApplicant filed his tax returns on time for the tax years he failed to pay his taxes. No \nexplanation was provided as to why he failed to pay his taxes on time for a period of 16 \ntax years. \n \n \nApplicant provided four documents titled: Certificate of Release of Federal Tax \nLien dated June 5, 2009, that lists the place of filing as two different counties in his \nstate. It appears the $664,401.23 tax lien is released.5 Applicant did not provide an \nexplanation as to what actions he took to obtain the release. If he paid the delinquent \namount, he did not explain how much he paid, when he paid it, or how he obtained the \nfunds to pay it.  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n4 Item 3.  \n \n5 Item 8. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nApplicant had a $664,401.23 federal tax lien entered against him in September \n1996. He provided no information that he attempted to take any action on this lien until \n\n \n5 \n \n \n2004, when he entered an OIC. He provided no explanation as to why he failed to pay \nhis taxes for 16 tax years. Applicant also had a debt to a telephone company that is in \ncollection status. I find both of the above disqualifying conditions have been raised by \nthe evidence. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and especially considered the following:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \nApplicant had a federal tax lien for $664,401.23 owed for 16 tax years. \nApparently, he failed to pay income tax. He offered no explanation as to why he failed to \npay his taxes for a period of 16 tax years. He did not enter into an agreement with the \nIRS to settle his tax debts until 2004 when he entered into an OIC. He lost his job and \nstopped paying the OIC. He failed to provide information as to what the status of the \nOIC was after he stopped paying the monthly payments he promised to pay. He \nprovided a certificate of release of the tax lien dated June 5, 2009, but failed to provide \nany information as to how he obtained the release. There is no evidence as to how \nmuch he may have paid on the remaining debt or what transpired after he stopped \npaying on it. In addition, no information or explanation was provided as to where he \nobtained the money to pay the debt.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to pay his federal income taxes for a period of 16 tax years is a \nserious security concern. He recently received a release of lien, but failed to provide an \nexplanation as to what actions he took to obtain the release. His repeated failure to pay \n\n \n6 \n \n \nhis taxes casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and judgment. I find mitigating \ncondition (a) does not apply. Applicant provided no explanation or evidence to show that \nthere were conditions beyond his control regarding his delinquent taxes or that he acted \nin good faith to resolve them. Applicant did not obtain an OIC until 2004. His delinquent \ntaxes were for a period of 16 tax years beginning in 1982. I find mitigating condition (b) \ndoes not apply.  \n \nApplicant did not provide evidence he received financial counseling. It appears \nthat, with the release of the tax lien, the largest debt alleged is satisfied and his financial \nproblems are under control. I find mitigating condition (c) applies. \n \nApplicant did not pay his taxes for a period of 16 tax years. He did not work out a \nsettlement with the IRS until 2004. He did not provide any explanation as to why he \nfailed to pay his taxes on time or why he waited years to resolve his tax debts. He failed \nto explain how he eventually resolved his tax debt. I do not find, under the \ncircumstances, that waiting years to pay his taxes is a good-faith effort to resolve his \ndebts. I find mitigating condition (d) does not apply. \n \nApplicant explained in his answer that he disputed his debt for telephone \nservices. He terminated his contract because he was dissatisfied with the service. He \ndid not provide any documented proof to substantiate the basis of his dispute, but did \nprovide a copy of his credit report to show he disputed the debt and it is being \ninvestigated. Therefore, I find mitigating condition (e) partially applies. \n \nAnalysis \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant failed to pay his \nfederal income taxes for tax years 1982 through 1994 and had a tax liability for tax \nyears 1995, 1996, and 2001. He failed to provide any explanation for his failure to \ncomply with the tax rules. In 2004, he entered into an OIC with the IRS, but due to a \nperiod of unemployment, he stopped making payments on the settlement. He failed to \nexplain what, if any, arrangements were made with the IRS. He provided a release of \ntax lien dated June 5, 2009, from the IRS, but he did not explain what actions he took to \nobtain the release. Applicant also disputed a telephone debt. He did not provide any \ndocumentation to substantiate his dispute, but did dispute it on his credit report. \nApplicant did not provide enough evidence to explain the circumstances of his large tax \ndebt or the reasons he failed to pay his taxes. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the relevant circumstances presented by the record in this case, it \nis not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 27, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested that his case be decided on the written record.  On July 29, 2009, after the close of the\nrecord, Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision.\n\n2\nSome of Applicant\u2019s assertions on appeal rely on matters not contained in the record below.\nAs such, the assertions are based on new evidence.  The Board cannot consider new evidence on\nappeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nThe Judge found that Applicant owed the two delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  She found\nthat the first debt was to a telephone company in the amount of $189, and was in collection status\nat the time of the close of the record.  The Judge found that Applicant admitted that he owed the\nInternal Revenue Service $664,401 in the form of a tax lien for past due liabilities for the tax years\n1982 through 1994 and other federal taxes for the tax years 1995, 1996 and 2001.  The Judge found\nthat Applicant entered into an Offer in Compromise (OIC) with the IRS in August 2004.  Applicant\nclaimed that the tax lien debt was reduced in accordance with the OIC to $63,179.  The Judge found\nthat a payment schedule was set up, but Applicant lost his job in February 2005 and ceased making\npayments on the tax lien in July 2005.  The Judge noted that Applicant claimed that the IRS had\napplied refunds to the outstanding amount of the OIC, and he purportedly owed $4,478 as of April\n2008.  Without making a more specific finding, the Judge found that the $4,478 figure represented\nonly the balance owed for tax year 1996 and did not represent the entirety of Applicant\u2019s unpaid\nbalance owed to the IRS.  She found that there was no explanation for why Applicant failed to pay\nhis taxes on time for a period of 16 years.  The Judge referenced documents submitted by Applicant,\ndated June 5, 2009, indicating that the $664,401 tax lien was released.  The Judge noted that\nApplicant did not provide an explanation as to what actions he took to obtain the release, how much\nhe paid on the lien, when he paid it, or how he obtained the funds to pay it.  \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s two delinquent debts were of security significance,\nalthough she concluded that the telephone company debt was mitigated.  She noted that Applicant\nprovided no information that he attempted to take any action on the tax lien until 2004, and that he\nprovided no explanation as to why he failed to pay his taxes for 16 years.  The Judge further noted\nthat Applicant failed to provide information as to the status of the OIC after he stopped making\npromised monthly payments, failed to provide information as to how he obtained the release of the\nlien, and failed to show how much he may have paid on the remaining debt.  Overall, the tax debt\nwas not mitigated because Applicant did not provide enough evidence to explain the circumstances\nof the large debt or the reasons he failed to pay his taxes.         \nApplicant argues that he never admitted that he owed the IRS $664,401.  He says that as of\nJune 2009, he has no better understanding of why the IRS advised him that he no longer owed taxes\nthan he does of the original lien figure of $664,401.  He also argues that he has never failed to live\nwithin his means and that he satisfied the IRS obligation to the best of his ability and apparently to\nthe satisfaction of the IRS.  These assertions do not establish error on the part of the Judge.\nApplicant\u2019s denial that he admitted he owed the amount of the IRS tax lien is proffered for\nthe first time on appeal.  The Board has reviewed Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR and his\nsubmissions to the record, and concludes that nothing in Applicant\u2019s statements in the record can be\nreasonably construed as a denial of the allegation that he owed the IRS $664,401.  The Board has\nalso reviewed the totality of the record evidence and concludes that there is sufficient record\nevidence to support the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant owed the amount stated in the IRS tax lien.\n\n3\nThe gravamen of the Judge\u2019s decision is that, given the establishment of the debt to the IRS,\nthere is insufficient evidence to mitigate the government\u2019s concerns because of Applicant\u2019s failure\nto explain adequately the circumstances of the debt, the reasons behind Applicant\u2019s failure to address\nhis tax delinquencies until 2004, and the circumstances surrounding the release of the tax lien.  There\nis no presumption of error below.  Given the paucity of evidence in this record that addresses the\nJudge\u2019s stated concerns, her ultimate adverse security decision and the analysis articulated in support\nof it are sustainable.\n After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.
