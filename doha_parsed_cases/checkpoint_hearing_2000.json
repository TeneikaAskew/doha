O\u2019Brien, Esq. \n08/05/2021 \nDecision \nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge: \nAfter retiring from the US Army in September 2013, Applicant, attended a job \nfair in November 2013 sponsored by primarily defense-cleared contractors. \nUnemployed and using credit cards to pay expenses, she accepted a job as an agent to \npurchase a specific car for a car-firm (firm), and then immediately sell the same car to \nthe firm, which was actually a criminal enterprise that sold and transported these cars to \noverseas buyers. The principal of the business was eventually convicted of fraud and \nsentenced. Though she found a job in 2014, following nine months of unemployment, \nshe was unable to catch up on her mortgage before foreclosure and sale of her home in \nJune 2017. After enrolling in a credit counseling and debt consolidation service plan in \n2015, she successfully paid off several unlisted debts by 2018; she also repaid a \ngovernment student loan in late 2020.

On August 14 and August 24, 2018, she provided personal \nsubject interviews (PSIs) to an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM). The Department of Defense (DOD) could not make the affirmative findings \nrequired to continue a security clearance. DOD issued to Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) dated June 12, 2020, detailing security concerns raised by financial \nconsiderations (Guideline F). The action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant\u2019s notarized answer to the SOR is dated September 11, 2020. (AE 1) \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nDecember 11, 2020, for a hearing on January 12, 2021. The hearing was held as \nscheduled. (AE 1) \nAt the hearing, the Government\u2019s four exhibits (GE) 1-4, and Applicant\u2019s three \nexhibits (AE 1-3) were entered into evidence without objection.

Applicant essentially \nadmitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c, but denied SOR \u00b6 1.b because she was deceived by the \nrepresentations of the car-firm (firm) and had no intention of defrauding anyone.

The monthly mortgage payment was $2,350 a month. When she was \ndischarged from the Army in September 2013, she was unemployed for nine months \nbefore finding work in June 2014 as a cashier at a sporting goods company. She has \nhad uninterrupted full-time employment since then. (GE 1 at 10; Tr. 90; AE 1F) \nDuring her nine-month period of unemployment, Applicant\u2019s husband was \nunemployed for a couple of months during the period too. Nevertheless, she continued \nto pay her monthly mortgage with savings, while accumulating additional delinquent \ndebt on her credit cards before and during the above time span. She made her last \nmortgage payment in May 2014. Subsequently, she offered partial payments, but the \nlender wanted the entire mortgage payment or nothing. She continued to live on the \nproperty until June 2017 without making any payments. (Tr. 91-93; AE 2B at 6-8) \nDuring the three-year period that Applicant did not pay the mortgage, she did \nnot save the money used to pay the mortgage either. Instead, she used the money for \nother bills. She enrolled in a debt consolidation service and received financial \ncounseling. She started a repayment plan with the service in 2015, successfully \nrepaying about $8,200 of delinquent debt in June 2018. Applicant was evicted between \nApril and July 2017 and the house was sold after foreclosure. (AE 3H, 3H1) She kept \nher supervisors and security officials aware of the foreclosure and sale of the home, and \nthe car investigation (SOR \u00b6 1b). (GE 1 at 44; Tr. 52-53, 91-93) \nThe documents and credit reports initially show the foreclosure, the 2017 sale \nof the home, and deficiency balance of $85,382 appearing in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant\u2019s \n2020 credit reports show \u201cforeclosure redeemed,\u201d with no outstanding balance due. No \nadditional information appears in the credit reports. (AE 2B at 6-8; AE 3C at 33-34, 53; \nAE 3D \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \u2013 This is an installment car loan account that was opened in \nNovember 2013 when Applicant, who had been hired by the firm to purchase and sell \ncars, purchased a specific car from a dealership at the firm\u2019s direction, and sold it the \nnext day to the firm. The installment account became delinquent in August 2014, with a \nposted past-due amount of $58,284, following a 71-month account review. In December \n2019, the account was designated as charged off. (GE 3 at 2) In October 2020, the \naccount was still designated as charged off following an 80-month account review. A \npast-due amount of $0 dollars was posted. In November 2020, the lender notified \nApplicant that the delinquent debt was cancelled and they would not attempt to collect \non the debt. No additional information appears in the credit reports.

Between June and the middle of \nNovember 2013, she attended job fairs and interviews in search of full-time defense \ncontract employment. However, her job search was hampered by the Federal \nGovernment shutdown in October 2013, causing defense contractors to immediately \nsuspend hiring. Applicant had two defense contractors willing to hire her, but could not \nbecause of the shutdown. (Tr. 68, 115) \nBefore a job fair in November 2013, Applicant received an email from the firm \nto interview for a job. At the interview, she recalled signing documents akin to an \nemployment application. However, she was unable to produce those documents. She \ndid submit a job flyer from the firm, but there is no indication this flyer was in use when \nApplicant was employed by the firm. Under the agreement she made with the firm, \nwhich was not in writing, her job was to purchase a car for the firm from a pre-arranged \ndealership and then immediately sell the car to the firm the next day, shortly after the \nNovember 2013 holiday. The firm was responsible to pay the lender in installments \ndescribed in the finance charge documentation appearing with the bill of sale. After \nsigning the bill of sale as the selling agent and receiving $600 in pay from the firm, \nApplicant believed she had no further financial obligations related to the car or future \njobs with the firm. A week later she thought she had been hired for full-time employment \nand was waiting on a start date. (Tr. 31, 55, 57-59, 67-68, 72-76, 96-103, 115) See also \nAE 1C, 1E at 2-3, 7; AE 5T at 251-253. \nApplicant recalled asking questions by the firm\u2019s personnel at the interview and \nafterward, but always received answers that relieved her suspicions about the \narrangement to purchase and sell the car. She talked with her husband and a friend. \nThey considered the purchasing agreement was odd, but they did not believe she \nshould cancel the agreement altogether. Thinking that the firm was a legitimate \nbusiness because they were participating at the job fair with numerous reputable \ndefense contractors, Applicant did not believe a background check was necessary. She \ndid not question why the firm wanted her to purchase a car from a dealership, then \nimmediately sell the car to the firm at the same price that she purchased the car from \nthe dealership. (Tr. 72, 97-99) \nApplicant had no further contact with the firm or the lender identified in the bill \nof sale until August 2014, when the lender notified her that she had missed a monthly \ninstallment payment for the car. Though she did not dispute the car debt with the lender \nor credit agencies, she put the lender in touch with law enforcement. She also tried to \ncontact the firm without success. In September 2014, she was contacted by another \npotential victim of the car scheme (this person became the victims\u2019 group leader) and \nlearned that there were 73 individuals who had been victimized by the firm in the same \nmanner as Applicant. The firm\u2019s primary objective in the scheme was to have the \nvictims like Applicant sign the bill of sale. The firm would make payments to the lender \nuntil they found an overseas buyer. Then they stopped payments and had the car \ntransported to the overseas buyer. Even though she viewed her signature on the bill of \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsale as ending her financial liability, because her name continued to appear on the bill \nof sale, she essentially became a guarantor for the installment loan, making her \npotentially liable to the lender when the firm defaulted on the contract. (Tr. 53, 57-60, \n79-80, 102, 104-105; AE 3I at paragraph 6; AE 1D at 1-3; AE 4A at 11) \nThe victims\u2019 group leader increased his contact with the local police authorities \nin late 2014. Over the next few years, several conversations, by email and face-to-face, \nwere held between the group leader, the victims, the lenders of the installment loans, \nand detectives of the local police department. The victims also communicated among \nthemselves by email and phone about the best course of legal action against the car \nfirm. From 2014 to 2018, Applicant kept in constant contact by email with the other \nvictims and the victims\u2019 group leader. (AE 4A-AE 9A) They decided to allow law \nenforcement handle the matter rather than file a civil action that would be expensive. \n(Tr. 59; AE 1D at 1-3; AE 4L at 39-40; AE 6K at 332; AE 7B at 399) \nIn June 2018, Applicant learned by email that the chief executive officer of the \nfirm was found guilty of fraud and sentenced to four years imprisonment and five years \nparole. The other co-defendants were prosecuted as well. (Tr. 67; AE 9A at 417-418; \nAE 9A at 432) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 In her April 2018 e-QIP, Applicant stated that she was indebted for \nan education loan to the Veteran Affairs (VA) for classes she began taking in April 2017. \nShe believed that her imminent foreclosure (SOR \u00b6 1.a) contributed to her dropping out \nof classes. In June 2017, when the loan became delinquent, she was notified that she \nwould have to repay the loan because she did not maintain a \u201cC\u201d average. The reason \nfor the delay in repayment was that she could not find the proper contact at VA to begin \na repayment plan. Before she made payments in late 2020 on the loan, she believes \nher 2018 Federal tax refund was seized as partial payment of the loan account. \nDocumentation indicates that she made the balance of payments due on the loan \nbetween October and December 2020. (GE 1 at 46-47; GE 4 at 7; Tr. 106, 109-112; AE \n2B at 8; AE 3A, 3C) \nAs a result of the purchase and sale of the car, and the foreclosure and sale of \nher home in 2017, Applicant credibly testified that she has become much more vigilant \nin monitoring her debt and more resistant to making purchases on credit that ultimately \nincrease her debt. She and her husband realize that the family will have to reduce the \nextracurricular activities in which they participate while budgeting for sending their \noldest daughter to college in the fall. Applicant is trying to save money and continue to \nlive within her means. Applicant has no other delinquent debts and up-to-date on her \ntaxes. (Tr. 82-84, 87-88, 107-108) \nCharacter Evidence \nWhen her oldest daughter joined a youth organization for girls and young \nwomen in 2009, Applicant began her volunteer work with that organization and became \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvery active at all management levels. She started as a troop leader and moved up in \nresponsibility to the service unit level. Then she became service unit cookie manager \nand full product sales manager. Next, she became a service unit registrar to expand the \norganization\u2019s membership. As a day camp coordinator, Applicant was an archery \ninstructor. When her daughter aged out of the young women\u2019s organization in 2018, \nApplicant ceased her affiliation with the organization and turned her attention to her \ndaughter\u2019s extracurricular high school activities. (Tr. 85-87) \nA program manager for Applicant\u2019s employer testified by phone that he has \nknown her for the last two or three years. He supervised her during the 2019 timeframe \nwhen she was a systems engineer. He considered her to be diligent worker who was \ntrustworthy and a self-starter. He recommends her for a security clearance based on \nher good judgment. In a six-month performance evaluation for the period ending in \nFebruary 2020, the program manager indicated that Applicant\u2019s advance knowledge \nand work ethic presented superior benefits to contract leadership and client leadership. \n(Tr. 14-23; AE 3F) \nApplicant\u2019s husband testified they have been married for 14 years or since \n2007. He acknowledged that they talked about the employment with the firm (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b), but based on the fact that all job fair participants were cleared, they assumed the \nfirm was a legitimate business. (Tr. 23-31) \nIn the husband\u2019s view, Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness has kept them married. She \nprovided unwavering support when he learned he had to leave the service because of a \nreduction-in-force. He believes Applicant would never intentionally do anything illegal. \nHe believes she has the necessary judgment and trustworthiness to merit security \nclearance eligibility. (Tr. 31-40) \nA friend and Applicant\u2019s former coworker for 12 years, admires how dedicated \nshe has been to the United States and her family. Based on her strong work ethic and \ndependability, Applicant warrants a security clearance. (AE 1G) \nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor from 2016 to 2019, praised her hard-work and \ncommitment to complete the task at hand regardless of difficulty. The supervisor \nobserved her patience and problem-solving ability. As one of the supervisor\u2019s best \nemployees, Applicant warrants a security clearance. (AE 1H) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nIn June 2014, Applicant stopped paying the mortgage on her home (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a). I conclude that Applicant was not responsible for charged off car debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b. Rather, she was victimized by the fraudulent scheme of the firm. In June 2017, the \neducation loan became delinquent. The inability to satisfy the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.c establishes a history of accumulating delinquent financial obligations with \nthe meaning of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b. - The circumstances leading to Applicant\u2019s November 2013 \nshort-term employment with the firm (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and inability to pay her mortgage \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) beginning in June 2014 were related events aggravated by financial \nproblems. Though she had been actively searching for employment since June 2013, \nshe had no job after her honorable discharge in September 2013. She experienced \nadded anxiety about her near-term employment prospects when the Federal \ngovernment shutdown in October 2013 triggered a hiring freeze by defense contractors. \nAt least one prospective employer could not hire her as a result of the freeze. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s decision to participate in the car transaction constituted poor \njudgment, the firm clearly took advantage of her unemployment and her naivet\u00e9 to the \nfraud contained in the contractual arrangement that concealed her potential liability. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s exculpatory actions in cooperating with the victims\u2019 group leader \nand the authorities leading to the prosecution and conviction of the principal actor and \nhis coconspirators, I am convinced she had nothing to do with the scheme of the firm to \nfraudulently sell cars to overseas buyers. \nThough Applicant stresses that her nine-month period of unemployment in the \nfirst half of 2014 was the sole reason she was unable to continue paying her mortgage, \nher August 2018 personal subject interview (PSI) shows that some overuse of credit \nduring the period contributed to her financial difficulties. While she was forthright about \nthe foreclosure in her previous security clearance reviews, and in her April 2018 e-QIP, \nher August 2018 PSI, and at the January 2021 hearing, little if any mitigation is available \nunder AG \u00b6 20(d) because Applicant has had steady employment since June 2014. In \naddition to offering partial mortgage payments, which were rejected by the lender, she \ncould have tried alternatives, i.e., a home loan modification (HLM), a short-sale, or \nreturn the home to the lender via deed-in-lieu of foreclosure options, to avoid \n8 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nforeclosure of her home. Instead, she remained in the residence illegally for three years. \nRegarding the VA education account (SOR \u00b6 3.a), Applicant stated in her \nAugust 2018 PSI that she was trying to find the proper VA payment location to begin a \nrepayment plan. She recalled that her 2018 tax refund was subtracted from the \ndelinquent account balance. Even though Applicant\u2019s documentation shows that she did \nnot completely satisfy the education account until December 2020, six months after she \nreceived the SOR, she is still entitled to some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) based on her \naffirmative conduct in following through with her August 2018 intention of establishing a \nrepayment plan to resolve the account. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies based on Applicant\u2019s financial counseling and successful \ncompletion of a three-year payment plan in 2018, showing that she paid off \napproximately $8,200 in unlisted delinquent debt. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is \nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation \nor recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nIn June 2013, Applicant realized she could not reenlist in the Army. In the same \nmonth, she began looking for a job in the defense contractor industry. In October 2013, \nshe had at least one defense contractor ready to hire her. Unfortunately, the Federal \nGovernment shutdown prevented this contractor from hiring her. Applicant was still \nunemployed in November 2013 when the firm hired her. \nHaving carefully evaluated Applicant\u2019s August 2018 PSI and her January 2021 \ntestimony, it is fair to conclude that she was in \u201cover her head\u201d when she agreed to the \nterms of the firm\u2019s employment. Unlike the other participants of the job fair, no security \nclearance was required by the firm and she never signed an agreement to work for the \nfirm. She knew or should have known that car ownership could not be transferred \nwithout a car title. In sum, Applicant\u2019s exercised poor judgment. However, the \n9 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________ \nunintentional blunder involving the firm occurred only once, more than six years ago, \nand the conduct is ultimately mitigated. \nApplicant was unemployed for nine months until June 2014, when she stopped \nmaking the mortgage payments. Overuse of credit before and during the period must \nalso be considered based on the type of accounts she confirmed in the August 2018 \nPSI. Even though she should have done more to address the delinquent mortgage, she \ndid not lay fallow during the three-year period. She paid off about $8,200 of delinquent \ndebt when she successfully completed the repayment a plan in June 2018. She \nprovides encouraging evidence showing that she has been trying to manage her \nfinances more responsibly. Additional financial counseling is necessary to fortify \nApplicant\u2019s management of her finances. She should create a flexible written budget to \nmonitor her income and spending on a regular basis. When her income and spending \nchanges she should make the corresponding changes in her budget. \nApplicant\u2019s character evidence from a former supervisor, and present and \nformer coworkers demonstrate that she is good at what she does. Her commitment to \nher children\u2019s extracurricular activities is admirable. Based on the surrounding \ncircumstances in this case, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from \nthe guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

The financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 5, 2019. She \nwas interviewed by a government investigator on August 8, 2019, and on October 30, \n2019. After reviewing the information gathered during the background investigation, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) issued her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on February \n14, 2020, alleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). \nApplicant timely answered the SOR, and requested a decision based on the written \nrecord in lieu of a hearing. \nA copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), containing the \nevidence supporting the security concerns, was provided to Applicant by letter dated \nJanuary 19, 2021. Applicant received the FORM on January 28, 2021. She was granted \na period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM to submit any objections to the FORM \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand to provide material to refute, extenuate, and mitigate the concerns. Applicant \nresponded to the FORM via a three-page letter dated February 9, 2021, with numerous \ndocuments in extenuation and mitigation, and two reference letters. The case was \nassigned to me on March 12, 2021. \nProcedural Issue \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel advised Applicant that the FORM included \ntwo unauthenticated summaries of interviews with a government background \ninvestigator on August 8, 2019, and October 30, 2019. (FORM, Item 6) Applicant was \ninformed she could object to the summaries of her interviews, and they would not be \nadmitted or considered, or that she could make corrections, additions, deletions, and \nupdate the documents to make them accurate. Applicant was informed that her failure \nto respond to the FORM or to raise any objections could be construed as a waiver and \nthe proposed FORM evidence would be considered. \nApplicant\u2019s February 2021 response to the FORM included receipts for payments \nmade on accounts alleged in the SOR, and other favorable evidence. Applicant did not \nraise any objections to the FORM or to me considering the unauthenticated summaries \nof her August and October 2019 interviews. Without objections, I admitted all of the \nFORM\u2019s proffered evidence and Applicant\u2019s documentary evidence and considered \nthem. \nFindings of Fact \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted 9 of the 25 financial allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.p, 1.q, 1.t, 1.v, and 1.x). She denied 16 SOR financial allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a through 1.c, 1.e, 1.i through 1.o, 1.r, 1.s, 1.u, 1.w, and 1.y). Notwithstanding, all of \nthe SOR allegations are established by the record evidence. Her admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact:  \nApplicant is a 56-year-old consultant/program manager working for a Federal \ncontractor. She has been married and divorced three times. She last divorced back in \nJune 2000. She has one adult child, age 32. Applicant attended college between \nJanuary 2008 and May 2013, and earned an associate\u2019s degree. \nApplicant started working for her current employer, a Federal contractor and her \nclearance sponsor, in December 2015. According to her 2019 SCA, she has been fully \nemployed, and without periods of unemployment, since 2015. However, Applicant \ndisclosed in her 2019 SCA a work history marred by periods of unemployment. She was \nunemployed between July 2015 and December 2015; between November 2013 and \nApril 2014; between November 2011 and August 2012; and between August 2009 and \nOctober 2009. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant has four prior periods of employment with Federal contractors - \nbetween April 2014 and July 2015 (laid off); between December 2010 and November \n2011; between October 2009 and May 2010; and between August 2006 and August \n2009. She was granted eligibility for a secret clearance in August 2008. \nIn response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of her 2019 SCA, Applicant \ndisclosed she had financial problems that included a delinquent car loan, a repossessed \ncar, and cancelled credit cards. She attributed her financial problems to her periods of \nunemployment caused by corporate downsizing and her suffering from chronic \nmigraines, which caused excessive absenteeism. Applicant noted that she currently (as \nof February 2021) was seeing a new neurologist and had her migraines under control \nand has not had to miss work. \nThe subsequent background investigation addressed her financial situation and \nrevealed the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. During her August and October \n2019 interviews with a government investigator, Applicant discussed her delinquent \naccounts, and that she filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 2, 2012, and was \ndischarged of her dischargeable debts in May 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.x). \nApplicant\u2019s explanations for the SOR accounts and the status of the accounts \nfollow: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($12,719) and 1.w ($16,591) \u2013 These alleged the same account, a \ncharged-off car loan. I find SOR \u00b6 1.w for Applicant. Applicant stated that in December \n2016, she took a loan of more than $16,000 to purchase a car. She claimed the creditor \ntold her that the first payment of $450 was due three months later. (Item 6) The loan; \nhowever, required her to start making the first payment within 30 days and monthly \nthereafter. She failed to make the first three payments and the car was repossessed. \nShe claimed she never received notice of her default or the repossession. I note that in \nher SOR answer (Item 2), Applicant stated she was granted 60 days to make the first \nmonthly payment. Applicant claimed this charged-off account was supposed to be \nremoved from her credit report, but provided no reason for that. She presented no \ndocumentary evidence to corroborate any of her claims. This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \u2013 This is an $8,226 charged-off car loan. Applicant claimed that this \naccount was discharged through the bankruptcy in May 2012, and that it is no longer \nreflected in her credit reports. On the contrary, the record credit reports show that this \naccount was opened in November 2012, five months after the May 2012 bankruptcy \ndischarge. (Items 5, 7) She presented no documentary evidence to corroborate her \nclaim that the account was included in her bankruptcy discharge. This debt is \nunresolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($6,098) and 1.y ($6,098) alleged the same charged-off account. I \nconsolidated the allegations under SOR \u00b6 1.c. I find SOR \u00b6 1.y for Applicant. Applicant \nclaimed having no knowledge of this account and denied it. The account is reflected in \nApplicant\u2019s February 2020 credit report.

She presented \nno documentary evidence to corroborate her claims. This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e \u2013 This is a $1,853 collection. During the August 2019 interview, \nApplicant discussed this account with the interviewer. She denied having any \nknowledge of it. In her SOR answer, she claimed she \u201cdisputed the account with no \nresults.\u201d The account is shown as outstanding in Applicant\u2019s 2020 credit report. (Item 7) \nApplicant presented no documentary evidence to corroborate she disputed the debt or \nto establish the legal basis for the dispute. This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($733 charged-off account); 1.g ($648 charged-off credit card); 1.h \n($456 charged-off credit card) - Applicant admitted responsibility for these accounts \nduring her 2019 interview. Apparently, she contacted the creditors and established \npayment plans back in 2017. She then hired a debt-recovery company in 2017 to help \nher resolve her delinquent accounts and assigned the accounts to it. The 2020 credit \nreport notes that she disputed the debts after resolution and they were charged off. \nThese debts are unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($430), 1.j ($335), 1.k ($299), 1.n ($78), 1.o ($65), 1.r ($209), and 1.s \n($64), alleged medical debts placed for collection. During her 2019 interview, Applicant \nclaimed she was not aware of these delinquent accounts until she reviewed her credit \nreport in August 2019. In her Answer to the FORM, Applicant claimed she was not \nnotified of these debts, but was in the process of obtaining information to ensure she \ncan pay them in full. \nApplicant claimed she attempted to pay these medical debts with no results, \nbecause she did not have the account numbers and the creditors were not able to \nprovide her with the account numbers. She promised not to stop attempting to clear up \nthese debts. She presented no documentary evidence of efforts to settle, pay, or \notherwise resolve these debts. These debts are unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.l \u2013 This is a $271 delinquent account placed for collection. Applicant \ndisputed the account, as reflected in her 2020 credit report. (Item 7) She provided no \nevidence about the legal basis for the dispute or whether it has been resolved. This debt \nis unresolved. \nThis is a delinquent $263 unsecured loan that was charged off. \nDuring her 2019 interview, and in her Answer to the FORM, Applicant claimed having \nno knowledge about this account.

The 2020 credit report shows she started a \npayment plan in June 2018, but the account is still delinquent, and it was charged off. \nThe evidence is insufficient to show that the account was resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.u \u2013 This was a $410 account placed for collection. Applicant\u2019s \ndocumentary evidence shows she paid the account on January 28, 2020. \nSOR \u00b6 1.v \u2013 This was a $72 account placed for collection by a \ntelecommunications services provider. Applicant\u2019s documentary evidence shows she \npaid the account on January 28, 2020. \nSOR \u00b6 1.x \u2013 Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 2012 and her \ndischargeable debts were discharged in May 2012. She explained during the 2019 \ninterview that she had too many periods of unemployment, her income was insufficient \nto pay her living expenses and her debts, and she fell behind on her debt payments and \nhad to file for bankruptcy. Applicant stated that her financial status was much better \nafter the bankruptcy. \nIn her Answer to the FORM, Applicant stated her intent to get her finances back \non track. In her opinion, her current financial situation is good. She believes this is \nproven by a 200-point increase of her credit ratings. She noted that she has eight new \naccounts where she has kept current. She also noted that she obtained six new credit \ncards with low credit limits to begin rebuilding her credit. Applicant stated that she is not \nshirking on her responsibility to pay her debs. She averred she is taking her financial \nresponsibility seriously. She promised to continue paying off her delinquent debts, and \nto continue contacting the credit bureau agencies when there are discrepancies in her \nfinancial reports. \nApplicant believes her job has provided her with financial stability. She has been \nable to excel in her career and achieve her goals. She has been studying and obtaining \ncertifications to prepare herself for job promotions. Applicant\u2019s good performance has \nallowed her to receive pay and merit increases annually. She claimed she has been \nable to meet her goal to pay all of her bills on time with no delinquencies. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not present evidence of her current financial situation (gross \nmonthly income, deductions, monthly expenses, and monthly net remainder). She did \nnot present evidence to show that she has a working budget. There is some evidence to \nshow that she sought assistance from a debt-resolution company to resolve her \ndelinquent debts in 2017. However, she presented no documentary evidence to \ncorroborate that she hired the debt-resolution company, or of what the company did to \nhelp her with her financial problems. There is no evidence to show Applicant has had \nrecent financial counseling. \nApplicant submitted favorable references from a manager and a coworker. The \nmanager (M) has known Applicant for five years in a professional capacity. In his \nopinion, Applicant has displayed a high degree of integrity, responsibility, and ambition. \nHer leadership abilities, work ethic, and accomplishments have been highlighted by her \ntwo promotions. Applicant has been candid with her manager, discussing and keeping \nhim abreast of her financial difficulties. He believes that she is honest, reliable, and a \nhighly capable employee who displays good judgment. He endorses Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a clearance without reservations. \nApplicant\u2019s coworker has known her for three years. In his opinion, she is a team \nplayer who has displayed integrity, responsibility, excellent work ethic, and good \njudgment. He highly recommends Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. The delinquent \ndebts alleged in the SOR are established by her admissions and the record evidence. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established these disqualifying conditions, \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the seven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n20; however, only two are potentially applicable: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or to otherwise resolve debts. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a securit\n \ny clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013). \nThe AG \u00b6 20(b) financial considerations mitigating condition is not fully \nestablished by the facts in this case and does not mitigate the security concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems started before she filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2012. \nAfter her 2012 bankruptcy discharge, she acquired the delinquent accounts alleged in \nthe SOR, most of which are still ongoing and unresolved. Applicant\u2019s evidence is \nsufficient to establish that circumstances beyond her control contributed to her financial \nproblems, i.e., her periods of unemployment and underemployment, and her medical \nissues with migraine headaches. \n8 \n \nNotwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to establish that she has \nbeen financially responsible under the circumstances. She claimed, without \ncorroboration, that she hired a debt-resolution company in 2017. She failed to present \nevidence to show how the debt-resolution company helped her to resolve her financial \nproblems. There is no evidence to show that she is following a budget or received \nrecent financial counseling. Most of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve her debts happened \nafter she submitted her 2019 SCA and she was interviewed by Government \ninvestigators about her delinquencies. She did not present sufficient evidence of good-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfaith efforts to pay her debts before or after she received the SOR. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not \napplicable. \nThe SOR alleged 24 delinquent or charged-off accounts. Applicant received \nfavorable credit for resolving three of the SOR delinquent accounts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.p, 1.u, and \n1.v). I also gave her credit for the duplicate allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.w and 1.y). Filing for \nbankruptcy is a legal recourse to resolve financial distress. SOR \u00b6 1.x is resolved for \nApplicant. Applicant made a start in her path to acquiring financial responsibility, but she \nis not there yet. \nMoreover, Applicant failed to submit documentary evidence of her current \nfinancial situation (gross monthly income, deductions, monthly expenses, and monthly \nnet remainder) to show her ability to be financially responsible. Considering the \nevidence as a whole, Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to demonstrate her financial \nresponsibility, that her financial problems are being resolved, and that she has the \nfinancial ability to pay her debts. The financial considerations security concerns are not \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment: \nApplicant, 56, has been employed with Federal contractors intermittently since \n2006, but fully employed since 2015. This is not her first SCA. She was granted \neligibility for a secret clearance in 2008. Her evidence is insufficient to establish a track \nrecord of financial responsibility. It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding \nan applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against \ngranting a security clearance. Unmitigated financial considerations security concerns \nlead me to conclude that granting a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at \nthis time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l, \n1.m-1.o, and 1.q-1.t: \n9 \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.p and \n1.u-1.y: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance.

(GE 1) \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant testified that he fell behind on his child-support \npayments during his periods of unemployment. This began with a layoff in 2009. He \nalso acknowledged working odd jobs, but said that none of that income went to arrears \nor child support. (Tr. 85-90) Applicant testified that his child support went into arrears in \nabout 2012. (Tr. 100) \nApplicant testified that he is currently paying on his child support and has money \ntaken out of his paycheck regularly. He said the arrearage amount was incurred during \nhis various periods of unemployment. The child support concerns his two younger \nchildren, one of whom lives in his home state and one of whom is in another state. \nApplicant said he is paying between $500 and $600 in child support monthly for one \nchild, and about $425 for another child. Applicant does not believe that his monthly \npayments address the amount in arrears. Applicant did not provide documentation of \nthe current status of his child-support payments. (Tr. 47-54, 99-104) \nApplicant asserted that his student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b) is in deferment. He said he \nhas other student loans, which are also deferred.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement \nAG \u00b6 24 details the security concern for drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of\nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause\nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with\ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or\npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21\nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline\nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25 and the following is potentially applicable: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above \ndefinition).\u201d Applicant used marijuana on a weekly, at times daily, basis between May \n2003 and at least July 2016, as alleged. AG \u00b6 25(a) is satisfied. \nThe timing of Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana is unclear. He testified that his last \nuse occurred after the sudden death of a close friend. At times he testified that his last \nuse was in 2016; at other times, he testified his last use was in 2017. Applicant reported \non his SCA that he used marijuana as recently as July 2016 (as alleged). He testified \nthat he did not use marijuana on probation. He testified that he last used marijuana \nshortly before entering the diversion program after his 2014 DUI. That charge was nolle \nprossed in October 2016, and he said the diversion program lasted about nine months. \nEven if Applicant did not use marijuana in 2017, his 2016 use was likely during the \ndiversion program, or, at the least, while his DUI case was pending. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \nApplicant used marijuana on a weekly, even daily basis for about thirteen years, \nas recently as July 2016.

Even if this were established, his periods of probation served only as gaps \nbetween the times when he was using marijuana. Given the extent of his marijuana \ninvolvement, which encompasses many years and which ended only recently, Applicant \ndid not establish a pattern of abstinence or a likelihood that his marijuana use will not \nrecur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and (b) do not apply. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 details the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant was convicted on a felony child-abuse charge in 1994 and served five \nyears in jail. He was arrested for larceny in 2001. He received probation but failed to \npay the fine, so he was arrested again in 2003. At that time, he gave a false name to the \npolice. Applicant was arrested for DUI in 2006. In 2012, he was arrested for public \nintoxication and resisting arrest. In 2014, he was arrested on another DUI charge. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (b) apply to those offenses. \nApplicant was also arrested in 2012 on a felony child-abuse charge. (SOR \u00b6 3.c) \nHe denied SOR \u00b6 3.c but reported the arrest on his SCA. The arrest is also established \nby GE 5, his criminal record. The arrest is a matter of official record, which is sufficient \nto satisfy AG \u00b6 31(b). \nThe citations for driving on a suspended license (2006), and for speeding and \nimproper lane usage (2012 and 2014) are not established as criminal conduct. Rather, \nthey are likely traffic infractions.

When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same \nguideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See \nISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 21, 2005). Applicant was arrested in \n2001 for larceny (SOR \u00b6 3.f). He failed to pay a related fine so he was arrested in 2003 \non the same charge. (SOR \u00b6 3.e) As to the larceny charge, they are duplicative, as the \ntwo allegations concern the same conduct. However, SOR \u00b6 3.e also concerns an \nunrelated charge of making a false report to the police. Thus, SOR \u00b6 3.e is not entirely \nduplicative of SOR \u00b6 3.f, and cannot be found in Applicant\u2019s favor on that basis. \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;   \n(c) no reliable information that Applicant committed the offense; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAs to the 2012 felony child-abuse charge at SOR \u00b6 3.c, Applicant does not \ndispute that he was arrested, but he denies the conduct. GE 5, Applicant\u2019s criminal \nrecord documents the arrest, but no disposition is noted. The police report is not in the \nrecord, so there is no record evidence of the underlying basis for the arrest. Applicant \nreported on his SCA that the charge was dismissed in 2014. His prior record includes a \n1994 conviction for the same conduct, followed by a five-year jail term. Given that fact, \nthe lack of a documented disposition of the 2012 charge suggests that it was not \nestablished. AG \u00b6 32(c) applies to SOR \u00b6 3.c. \nApplicant\u2019s most serious offense, his 1994 arrest and subsequent conviction for \nfelony child abuse, led to a five-year jail term. Since then, he has been arrested many \ntimes, from 2001 to as recently as 2014. He also illegally used marijuana for many \nyears, including as recently as 2017. All of his marijuana use occurred after his felony \nprison term. While Applicant\u2019s marijuana use is not alleged as additional criminal \nconduct, it nonetheless serves to undercut a finding that Applicant is fully rehabilitated, \nor that he has established sufficient compliance with rules, regulations, and the law. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal record is simply too long, too serious, and too recent to warrant a \nfinding that his criminal conduct is mitigated.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has over $120,000 in child-support arrears, and just over $10,000 in \nother delinquencies. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\n \n \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nNone of \nthese mitigating conditions fully apply. \nApplicant\u2019s financial \ndelinquencies are ongoing and unresolved. They may be attributable, in part, to his \nvarious periods of unemployment, but Applicant did not establish that his debts are \nlargely due to that circumstance, or are largely due to other conditions beyond his \ncontrol. Applicant indicated, but did not document, that he has been making payments \non his child-support debts. He also did not establish that, even if his current child-\nsupport obligations are being addressed, that he is also addressing his extensive past-\ndue child-support responsibilities alleged in the SOR. He did not establish that whatever \nconditions led to his financial problems are in the past and are unlikely to recur. He did \nnot establish that he has made a good-faith effort to pay or resolve his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), 20 (b), and 20(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F, H, and J in my whole-person analysis. Applicant is credited with improving \nhis education and with trying to make a better life for himself after serving several years \nin jail. However, his debts are too great, his criminal record is too extensive, and his \nmarijuana use is too long-term and too recent for him to establish sufficient evidence \nthat he warrants eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 46 years old. She has worked for a government contractor since December 2019. Before that she experienced unemployment from July 2019 until December 2019. She was fully employed for approximately 10 years before then. She received her bachelor\u2019s degree in 1996. She is divorced for the second time (dates of divorce: 2015 and 2019) and has two children for whom she pays $350 monthly in child support. (Items 4-5) The SOR alleged 12 delinquent debts totaling approximately $29,100. The debts are comprised of collections, charge offs, and past-due accounts (credit card, consumer debt, medical debt, student loans, and an auto repossession). The debts are established by Applicant\u2019s security clearance application (SCA), her background interview in December 2019, credit reports from November 2019 and December 2020, and her SOR admissions in her answer. (Items 3-7) Applicant attributes her financial problems to martial instability, as she had gone through two divorces in the past four years.

After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 46 years old. She has worked for a government contractor since \nDecember 2019. Before that she experienced unemployment from July 2019 until \nDecember 2019. She was fully employed for approximately 10 years before then. She \nreceived her bachelor\u2019s degree in 1996. She is divorced for the second time (dates of \ndivorce: 2015 and 2019) and has two children for whom she pays $350 monthly in child \nsupport. (Items 4-5) \nThe SOR alleged 12 delinquent debts totaling approximately $29,100. The debts \nare comprised of collections, charge offs, and past-due accounts (credit card, consumer \ndebt, medical debt, student loans, and an auto repossession). The debts are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s security clearance application (SCA), her background \ninterview in December 2019, credit reports from November 2019 and December 2020, \nand her SOR admissions in her answer. (Items 3-7) \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to martial instability, as she had gone \nthrough two divorces in the past four years. She believed her most recent divorce was \ninequitable and required her to pay most of the marital debt, which caused her to rely on \ncredit cards. She entered into a debt management plan in March 2019 and made \nseveral payments into the plan, but discovered that the fees were so high none of her \nmoney was going toward paying her debts. From January 2020 to January 2021 she \npaid $2,248 to the debt management company, which was less than half of what it \nrequired. No payments were made towards her debts. She ended the contract. (Item 5; \nAE A) \nApplicant failed to present documentation showing that she made payments on \nany of her debts. She provided a current budget that reflects that she has a monthly \nremainder of $39 after she pays all her expenses. She documented that she ended her \nlease in March 2021 and planned to move in with her mother, thereby saving her $1,400 \nmonthly. She believes she can use this amount to pay her delinquent debts. She also \nproposed a payment plan over the course of 11 months whereby she could settle all of \nher debts. This plan assumes that she can pay $2,500 each month toward her debts \nand that each creditor agrees to accept a 50 per cent settlement.

She did not provide any documentation reflecting \nsettlement discussions with any creditors. None of her SOR debts have been resolved. \n(AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAll of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unpaid or unresolved. She has a \nhistory of unpaid debts. I find the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties. The SOR debts are ongoing and \ntherefore recent. They all remain unresolved. She did not provide sufficient evidence to \nshow that her financial problems are unlikely to recur. On the contrary, the evidence \nshows that she does not currently have the financial resources to resolve her debts. AG \n\u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Although her two divorces since 2015 and her period of \nunemployment in 2019 are circumstances beyond her control, she failed to act \nresponsibly in addressing her debt. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. Her hiring of a debt \nmanagement company turned out to be an unwise decision because it failed to help her, \nand even cost her by taking funds away from her ability to pay her debts. Her efforts \nthus far are insufficient to conclude that her overall financial problems are being \nresolved or are under control. Her speculative plan to pay her debts in the next 11 \nmonths does not amount to a good-faith effort to resolve her delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(c) and 20(d) do not fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not established a \ntrack record of financial stability. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 25, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant\u2019s answered the SOR on July 19, 2020, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on December \n28, 2020. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The \nGovernment\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 7. Applicant did not provide a \nresponse to the FORM, object to the Government\u2019s evidence, or submit documents. Items \n1 through 7 are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on March 4, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 35 years old. He is a high school graduate. He married in 2008 and \ndivorced in 2012. He remarried in 2017. He has two children, ages 12 and 3, and two \nstepchildren ages, 7 and 4. \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent debts totally approximately $30, 816. Applicant \nfiled Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2015. It was dismissed for failing to make the prescribed \npayments. In his SOR answer, he explained that he filed bankruptcy because his fianc\u00e9 \nat the time was responsible for paying the bills while he was away. She failed to make the \npayments, and he was unaware until he began receiving notices from his creditors. He \nthen explained that his bankruptcy was dismissed because his employer had stopped \nmaking payments to the bankruptcy trustee. He was unaware that the payments had \nstopped. He filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 2020, after applying for a security \nclearance in October 2019. The Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharged was in September \n2020. (Items 2, 3, 5, 6) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s child support is past due in the amount of $730 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b). In his SOR answer, he stated that when he changed jobs in 2019, it took his \nemployer 45 days to begin an automatic draft for his child support payments. In his \nDecember 2019 background interview with a government investigator, he said he was \ncaught up on his child support payments after the delay from his employer. In his SOR \nanswer, he said in March 2020 he was receiving unemployment benefits and only $117 \nwas being withheld for child support. He said that all of his child support is \u201ccleared except \napproximately $180, which was included in my Chapter 7, bankruptcy.\u201d The bankruptcy \ndocuments clearly state that \u201cdomestic support obligations\u201d are not dischargeable in \nbankruptcy. His December 2019 credit report lists his child support in arrears in the \namount of $730. This was prior to a period of unemployment. Documents provided by \nApplicant show that his monthly obligation is $510, and he occasionally does not pay the \nfull amount, but extra is withheld during subsequent months. His document reflects that \nas of July 2020, he was in arrears for $180. (Items 1, 2, 4, 6, 7) \nApplicant\u2019s largest debt is for a repossessed vehicle (SOR \u00b6 1.c; $26,524-charged \noff). It appears the vehicle was purchased for $41,039 in 2014. In his background \ninterview, he told the investigator that his former wife handled all of the bills and he was \nunaware this account was delinquent. He could not recall the date he opened the account \nor when it became delinquent. The account was held individually by Applicant. It was \nincluded in his Chapter 13 bankruptcy, but when that was dismissed he returned the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe debts alleged in the SOR were discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, except \nthe child support obligation. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($1,219); 1.e ($1,107); 1.f ($507); \n1.g ($389); and 1.h ($304) are all medical debts. In his December 2019 interview, he told \nthe investigator that he was going to call the creditors within a week and find out if the \naccounts belonged to him, and if they did he would satisfy them. In his SOR answer, he \nadmitted owing the debts and including them in his bankruptcy. Applicant did not provide \nan explanation for why he failed to pay these debts.

The amount owed was the deficiency. Applicant said he attempted \nto reach a payment agreement with the creditor, but was unsuccessful. He told the \ninvestigator he would call the creditor within the week to make an agreement to pay the \ndebt. In his SOR answer, Applicant stated: \u201cI admit that I was delinquent to [creditor]. As \nof the date of this letter my debt with [creditor] has been cleared and closed stating paid \nin full.\u201d Later in his SOR answer, he said: \u201cIn January 2020, I made an agreement with \n[creditor] in the amount of $100 every month until paid off. All of my outstanding debt was \nincluded in my Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. All accounts are paid in full and states closed as of \nthe date of this letter.\u201d (Item 2) He failed to provide any information for why he failed to \npay this debt. His Chapters 13 and 7 bankruptcy documents and his December 2019 \ncredit report reflect the account was opened in February 2014. This purchase was made \ntwo years after his divorce. (Items 2, 4, 6, 7) \nThe debts alleged in the SOR are established by Applicant\u2019s SOR answer; a credit \nreport from December 2019; Chapter 7 bankruptcy documents; and his statements to a \ngovernment investigator in December 2019. Applicant alluded to a period of \nunemployment for his failure to pay his child support, but failed to provide specific \ninformation on when it started, how long he was unemployed, or his financial situation at \nthat time. He did not provide any current financial information. (Items 2, 4, 6, 7) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See, ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that began accumulating in \napproximately 2015. He filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2015 that was later dismissed for \nfailure to comply with the payment schedule. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted all of the debts in the SOR. He attributed his financial problems \nto others\u2019 failures to ensure his bills were paid. He claimed his fianc\u00e9 failed to pay his \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbills, and he was unaware they were delinquent; his employer failed to withhold his child \nsupport and he was unaware of it at the time; and his employer failed to pay his \nbankruptcy trustee through automatic withdrawal and it was subsequently dismissed, \nwhich he was also unaware of at the time. Applicant does not have a grasp on his \npersonal finances. After his divorce in 2012, he purchased an expensive vehicle, which \nhe subsequently defaulted on the loan. He did not provide an explanation for why he did \nnot pay his medical bills. After he applied for a security clearance, he filed Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy to have his debts discharged, which they were in September 2020. Applicant \nfailed to be responsible regarding his finances. There is insufficient evidence that his \nfinancial problems were the result of conditions that were beyond his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) \ndoes not apply. \nBased on the limited evidence submitted, I am not convinced that future financial \nproblems are unlikely to recur. Although bankruptcy is an authorized legal means to allow \none to start over, it does not negate consideration of the actions that led to financial \nproblems in the first place. Applicant\u2019s failure to pay his debts casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nAlthough evidence was not provided, Applicant likely complied with the financial \ncounseling mandated for filing bankruptcy. However, he failed to provide information as \nto his current financial situation. Therefore, I am unable to conclude that his finances are \nunder control. Bankruptcy is not considered a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors \nor resolve debt. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. He did not provide sufficient \nevidence to conclude he has established a track record of being fiscally responsible. The \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n12/02/2021 \nDecision \nNOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility to work \nin a public trust position in the defense industry. Applicant failed to mitigate the foreign \ninfluence concerns raised by his relationships with his wife and parents-in-law who are \ncitizens of Russia. His request for continued eligibility to occupy a position of trust is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 26, 2020, the DOD issued a SOR detailing security concerns under the \nforeign influence guideline. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry, signed by President Eisenhower on \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \nand the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017. DOD \nadjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant Applicant public trust eligibility. \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. At the hearing, convened \non July 27, 2021, I admitted as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I \u2013 II: the case management order \nissued on July 2, 2021; and, the disclosure letter the Government sent to Applicant, \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nserving him with the documents supporting the Government\u2019s case against him, dated \nApril 2, 2021.

(Tr. 12-15) \nProcedural Matters \nRequest for Administrative Notice \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of \ncertain facts regarding the Russian Federation (Russia). I granted the request without \nobjection from Applicant, and have considered information contained in the memoranda \nand attached documents related to each country, which are appended to the record as \nHE III. (Tr. 13) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 50, has worked as a project manager for a federal contracting \ncompany, operating in the healthcare industry, since August 2005. He was initially \ngranted public trust access in approximately 2006. He completed his most recent \nsecurity clearance application in January 2019, disclosing his September 2016 marriage \nto a woman who is a citizen of Russia. The SOR alleges as disqualifying under the \nforeign influence guideline, Applicant\u2019s relationship with his wife, and her parents who \nare both citizens and residents of Russia. Although the relationship is not alleged in the \nSOR, Applicant has a brother-in-law who is also a citizen and resident of Russia. (GE 1) \nRussia has a highly centralized, weak multi-party political system dominated by \nthe president. Russia has significant human-rights problems, marked by restrictions on \ncivil liberties, discrimination, denial of due process, forced confessions, torture, other \nprisoner mistreatment, and the government\u2019s failure to prosecute officials who commit \nserious violations. Government officials also engage in electronic surveillance without \nproper authorization. (HE III) \nRussia is one of the most aggressive countries conducting espionage against the \nUnited States, focusing on obtaining proprietary information and advance weapons \ntechnologies beneficial to Russia\u2019s military modernization and economic development. \nRussia\u2019s intelligence services as well as private companies and other entities frequently \nseek to exploit Russian citizens or persons with family ties to Russia who can use their \ninsider access to corporate networks to steal secrets. They also have offered financial \ninducements to U.S. government officials and citizens to encourage them to \ncompromise classified information. Russia\u2019s attempts to collect U.S. technological and \neconomic information represent a growing and persistent threat to U.S. security. (HE III) \nApplicant met his wife in January 2016, while she was in the United States \nvisiting friends. He sponsored her for permanent resident status, and she has resided in \nthe United States with him since July 2016. She has worked as a project manager for a \nwell-known global marketing information services firm since May 2017.

(GE 2; Tr. 16-17, 20) \nIn his March 2019 subject interview, Applicant told the investigator that before \nimmigrating, his wife worked in public relations for a Russian soccer club and for a \nRussian government agency. He reported that his father-in-law served in the Russian \nmilitary as a finance officer, and that he worked for another Russian government agency \nin a finance-related position until he retired. He reported that his mother-in-law retired \nfrom a secretarial position with the Russian government. Applicant stated that his \nbrother-in-law owns a construction company that builds residential homes, and that he \ndoes not have any contact with the federal government. In his answer to the SOR, he \nconfirmed his father-in-law retired from the Russian military in 1996, and that he retired \nfrom his positon in the Russian government in 2014. He also confirmed his mother-in-\nlaw retired from her government position in 2017, and indicated that both receive \npensions from the Russian government. He confirmed this information again at the \nhearing. (GE 2; Tr. 18, 22-25) \nAt the hearing, Applicant\u2019s wife testified about her and her parents\u2019 professional \ncareers. She corrected Applicant\u2019s previous statement that she worked for a \ngovernment agency, stating that she worked for a privately owned outdoor recreation \nfacility. Although she could not recall the specifics of her father\u2019s military service, she \ntestified that neither of her parents maintain contact with any government officials. At \nthe end of her testimony, she offered, for the first time, that there had been a \nmisunderstanding about her parent\u2019s work history. She stated that her parents did not \nwork for the Russian government, but for the city council of her hometown. (Tr. 28-40) \nApplicant\u2019s wife has traveled to Russia three times since 2017. He accompanied \nher in 2018 and 2019. Outside of these visits, his wife maintains weekly contact with her \nparents. She occasionally sends them between $100 and $500 as needed. Because \nthey do not speak a common language, Applicant does not maintain an independent \nrelationship with his parents-in-law. (Tr.17-18, 20-21, 24-25, 27) \nIn support of his application, Applicant provided four character letters from co\u00ad\nworkers that describe him as hard-working, diligent, and of high ethical character. Each \nwriter considers Applicant trustworthy. Applicant has owned his home since 2005. He \nhas no foreign assets. (GE 1; AE A-D) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a position of trust, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, administrative \njudges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nForeign Influence \n\u201c[F]oreign contacts and interests . . . are a national security concern . . . if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced to help a \nforeign person in a way that is inconsistent with U.S. interest or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure and coercion by any foreign interest.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) An assessment of \nforeign contacts should consider the country in which the foreign contacts are located, \nincluding but not limited to, consideration of whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to \nobtain classified or sensitive information, or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe SOR alleges as disqualifying Applicant\u2019s relationships with his wife, a citizen \nof Russia, and her parents who are citizens and residents of the same. Russia is an \naggressive participant in industrial espionage against the United States, oftentimes \nrelying on strategies that seek to exploit individuals with familial ties to the country. \nApplicant\u2019s wife maintains a close relationship with her parents as evidenced by the \nfrequency of her phone calls with her family, her annual visits home to visit them \nbetween 2017 and 2019, and her occasional financial support. \nAlso of security significance is Applicant\u2019s in-law\u2019s employment history with the \nRussian government. The record establishes that Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is a retired \nmilitary officer. However, the record contains conflicting information about his in-laws \nmore recent positions. Before the hearing, Applicant made three statements indicating \nthat his in-laws were both employed as civil servants with the Russian government. His \nwife offered new and conflicting testimony that her parents were employees of the \nmunicipal government in her hometown.

The following foreign influence disqualifying \nconditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 7(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heighted risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \nAG \u00b6 7(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \nHaving established its prima facie case, the burden shifts to Applicant to present \nwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts he has \nadmitted or those established by Department Counsel. Applicant has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion in obtaining a favorable clearance decision. (DOD Directive, \nAdditional Procedural Guidance \u00b6 E3.1.15.) He has failed to do so. \nThe security risk is not mitigated because Applicant\u2019s wife has applied for U.S. \ncitizenship, or because he and his in-laws do not speak the same language. Though \nApplicant may not have any direct ties of obligation to his in-laws, those bonds of \nobligation are imputed to him through his wife, who maintains close relationships with \nher parents. There is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, their immediate family members. See generally ISCR Case No. 01-03120, \n(App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). \u201c[A]s a matter of commonsense and human experience, there \nis [also] a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, \nthe immediate family members of the person\u2019s spouse.\u201d ISCR Case No. 07-17673 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 2, 2009) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002)). \nAccordingly, Applicant\u2019s relationship with his in-laws cannot be considered casual, nor \ncan his sense of obligation to them be considered minimal. None of the foreign \ninfluence mitigating conditions apply. \nIn reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-person factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(d). A finding that Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his \nrelationship with his Russian wife and in-laws does not suggest that Applicant is \nuntrustworthy or unreliable. It is not a finding that Applicant is unable to follow the rules \nregarding the proper handling and safeguarding public trust information. It is a finding \nnecessitated by the limited and conflicting information in the record. Without more \ninformation, Applicant\u2019s close ties to Russian citizens presents an unacceptable risk that \nhe may be influenced to act in a manner inconsistent with U.S. interests. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant access to sensitive information.

After reviewing the \ncompleted background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Counterintelligence \nand Security Agency (DCSA) could not determine that it was clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security for Applicant to have access to classified information, as \nrequired by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 \n(Directive). \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn June 12, 2020, DCSA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts and \nsecurity concerns addressed under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) applied during the adjudication of this case were issued by \nthe Director of National Intelligence (DNI) on December 10, 2016, and have been applied \nin all adjudicative actions taken on or after June 8, 2017. Applicant timely responded to \nthe SOR (Answer) and requested a decision without a hearing. \nAs provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, Department Counsel for the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) that was received by Applicant on April 1, 2021. The FORM contained seven \nexhibits (Items 1 \u2013 7) on which the Government relies to support the SOR allegations. \nApplicant was informed she had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit additional \ninformation. During that time, Applicant did not submit additional information or object to \nthe admission of any of the Government\u2019s documents into the record. The record closed \non May 1, 2021, and I received the case for decision on July 20, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owes $32,393 for 21 delinquent \nor past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.u). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with \nexplanations, the allegations at SOR 1.b \u2013 1.e, 1.g \u2013 1.k, and 1.t. She denied, with \nexplanations, the remaining SOR allegations (FORM, Items 1 and 2) In addition to the \nfacts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 43-year-old engineer employed by a defense contractor in a position \nthat requires a security clearance. She has held a security clearance since at least 2010 \nas part of her employment with several other defense contractors since 2008. She was \nhired for her current position in November 2018. Applicant was married between February \n2003 and December 2017, when she and her ex-husband divorced. Together, they had \none child, now an adult. (FORM, Item 3) \n \nIn her December 2018 e-QIP, Applicant did not disclose any adverse information, \nfinancial or otherwise. On January 10, 2019, government investigators obtained a report \nof Applicant\u2019s credit history (FORM, Item 7), which documented all but three (SOR 1.d \u2013 \n1.f) of the debts alleged in the SOR. On January 31, 2019, Applicant completed a personal \nsubject interview (PSI) with a government investigator. A summary of that PSI (FORM, \nItem 4) shows that, in relevant part, the interview included a discussion of the debts \ndocumented in the aforementioned credit report. For the most part, Applicant stated she \ndid not have any information about the debts. She also stated her intent to arrange \npayment, by the end of February 2019, of any debts she could verify with her creditors. \nOn June 12, 2019, government investigators obtained another report of Applicant\u2019s \ncredit history (FORM, Item 6). A final credit report pertaining to Applicant was obtained \non April 1, 2020 (FORM, Item 5). Together with the January 2019 report, these exhibits \ndocument all of the past-due and delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. Additionally, the \nthree credit reports and the PSI summary show that all of the debts at issue here were \nincurred and became delinquent before June 2019. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant first asserts that the debts at SOR 1.a, 1.l, 1.m, \n1.o, 1.p, 1.s, and 1.u were assigned to her ex-husband through their December 19, 2017 \ndivorce decree. She provided a copy of that decree with her Answer (FORM, Item 2). \nRather than support her claims in this regard, the divorce decree, while contemplating a \nnumber of financial matters (mortgage, student loans, car loans, etc.), makes clear that \nthere were no remaining joint, marital debts to be resolved. Additionally, all three credit \nreports provided by Department Counsel show that the debts at issue in this case are all \nindividual accounts in Applicant\u2019s name only. They are not joint accounts, responsibility \nfor which could be shared with someone else \u2013 a former spouse, for example. (FORM, \nItems 5 \u2013 7) \nAlso in response to the SOR, Applicant states that the medical debts alleged at \nSOR 1.c \u2013 1.e and 1.g \u2013 1.k stem from treatment she received for injuries suffered in a \ncar accident. She further stated she has retained legal counsel to pursue civil damages \nagainst the driver of the car at fault in that accident, and that she plans to use any \nsettlement proceeds to resolve those debts. In support of these claims, Applicant attached \nto her Answer information from a law firm, as well as reports about the accident itself. \nAlso included is a letter from the law firm to Applicant proposing that she authorize the \nfirm to pay one medical provider directly from any proceeds from her legal action. \nApplicant\u2019s information shows she was involved in an accident for which she was not at \nfault, and that she was injured and transported for medical treatment as a result of the \naccident. It further shows that Applicant is represented by an attorney who has contacted \nthe other driver regarding damages. By contrast, her information also shows that the \naccident in question occurred on July 19, 2019, well after all of the debts alleged in the \nSOR were reported as past-due or delinquent. (FORM, Items 2 and 5 \u2013 7). \nAs to the student loan debt alleged at SOR 1.b, Applicant denied that she owes \nthat debt. She also stated that she is contesting the validity of the debt, which she averred \nis in some form of litigation. She did not support this claim with any corroborating \ndocumentation. (FORM, Item 2) \nWith her Answer, Applicant provided information that on July 17, 2020, she settled \nthe debt at SOR 1.n for about ten percent of the total amount due. She also provided \ninformation showing that when the SOR was issued, she was working with a debt-\nmanagement company to verify and/or contest the debts documented in her credit \nreports. That information does not show that she has paid or otherwise resolved any of \nthe remaining debts alleged in the SOR. It also does not show that Applicant has received \nany financial counseling regarding the overall management of her personal finances. \n(FORM, Item 2) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAvailable information about Applicant\u2019s record of delinquent and past-due debts \nreasonably raises a security concern about her judgment and about the possibility she \nwould be prone to engage in improper conduct to resolve her debts. That concern is \nstated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Government provided sufficient, reliable information that shows Applicant \naccrued numerous delinquent debts before June 2019. That information shows that, with \none exception, all of those debts remain unpaid or otherwise unresolved. This information \nestablishes the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) and 19(c) \n(a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant made claims and submitted information that \nrequire consideration of the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nBased on my review of all of the available information, I conclude none of these \nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s debts are multiple and recent, in that they continue \nunresolved and are, for the most part, less than seven years old. Applicant did not support \nher claims that her debts were caused or exacerbated by events and circumstances \nbeyond her control. Her assertions regarding the adverse financial effects of a divorce \nand a car accident lack credibility. The information she provided about the debt \nmanagement company she retained does not equate to any identifiable progress in \nresolving her debts or improving her financial management posture. Further, Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \ndid not document any good-faith effort to pay her debts, and she did not support her \nclaimed disputes with any of her creditors. On balance, Applicant did not meet her burden \nof production in support of any of the available mitigating conditions. Accordingly, she \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns raised by the Government\u2019s information. \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline F, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Nonetheless, Applicant\u2019s failure \nto mitigate the security concerns about her finances only serves to sustain the \nGovernment\u2019s doubts about her judgment and reliability. Because protection of the \nnational interest is the principal focus in these adjudications, any remaining doubts must \nbe resolved against allowing access to sensitive information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.n \u2013 1.u: \nAgainst Applicant. \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 52 years old, a high school graduate, never married, with an adult son. Since August 2017, she has been employed by a defense contractor. (Items 3 and 5.) The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file her federal income tax returns for 2011 through 2018 and that as of the date of the SOR, the 2011 through 2015 returns remained unfiled. The SOR also alleges that Applicant owed $255 to the IRS. (Item 1.) Although Applicant denied the failure-to-file allegations (Item 2), the record shows that she belatedly filed those returns in 2018 and 2020. (Item 5 at 6.) Applicant proffered a number of reasons for her failure to timely file her returns: She was waiting to hear from the IRS that she calculated her return correctly; She had financial challenges (car repairs and a water leak at her home); She had trouble getting the required documentation (e.g., W-2s and 1098s); She was working full-time and had a part-time job as well; She was busy as the primary care giver of her mother who had dementia; and She did not know how to file returns for previous unfiled years.

The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines, effective \nwithin the DOD as of June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 2, 2020, and elected a decision on the \nwritten record by an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(DOHA). On January 27, 2021, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of \nrelevant material (FORM), including documents identified as Items1 through 5 (Items). \nApplicant was sent the FORM on January 28, 2021. She was afforded 30 days after \nreceiving the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. The SOR and the answer (Items 1 \nand 2) are the pleadings in the case. Items 3 through 5 are admitted without objection. \nThe case was assigned to me on June 4. 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 52 years old, a high school graduate, never married, with an adult son. \nSince August 2017, she has been employed by a defense contractor. (Items 3 and 5.) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file her federal income tax returns \nfor 2011 through 2018 and that as of the date of the SOR, the 2011 through 2015 returns \nremained unfiled. The SOR also alleges that Applicant owed $255 to the IRS. (Item 1.) \nAlthough Applicant denied the failure-to-file allegations (Item 2), the record shows that \nshe belatedly filed those returns in 2018 and 2020. (Item 5 at 6.) Applicant proffered a \nnumber of reasons for her failure to timely file her returns: \nShe was waiting to hear from the IRS that she calculated her return correctly; \nShe had financial challenges (car repairs and a water leak at her home); \nShe had trouble getting the required documentation (e.g., W-2s and 1098s); \nShe was working full-time and had a part-time job as well; \nShe was busy as the primary care giver of her mother who had dementia; and \nShe did not know how to file returns for previous unfiled years. (Items 2, 4, and 5.) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes the following condition that could raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19 in this case: \n(f) Failure to file \u2026 annual Federal \u2026 income tax \u2026returns \u2026 as required. \nThe record shows that the SOR allegations are established. AG \u00b6 19(f) \napplies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with appropriate tax authority to \nfile or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements, \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file runs from 2011 to as recently as 2020. Applicant\u2019s failure \nto file was neither infrequent nor long ago. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. None of the \nconditions cited by Applicant as excuses for her failure to file are contemplated by AG \u00b6 \n20(b). It does not apply. Applicant did not submit any documents showing any \narrangement with the IRS about her failure to file. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. Nor does \nApplicant\u2019s belated filing of her returns cure the security concerns she raised by those \nnumerous failures. See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018). I \nfind against Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nThe magnitude of Applicant\u2019s $255 debt to the IRS does not, in itself, raise security \nconcerns. I find in favor of Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n                              \n \n \n \n \n \n                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case.

DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 16, 2021. \nProcedural Issue \nThe Government moved to amend the SOR Guideline G at the beginning of the \nhearing based on documents discovered before the hearing. The Government moved to \nadd SOR allegation \u00b6 3.c: you were arrested in and around November 18 and charged \nwith DUI; allegation \u00b6 3.d: you were arrested in and around October of 2012 and charged \nwith DUI; and allegation \u00b6 3.e: you were arrested in and around August 2004 and charged \nwith DUI. Applicant was given an opportunity to respond to the amendment. He did not \nobject to the amendment and agreed to proceed. On June 4, 2021, The Government \nsubmitted an Amended SOR to include the original three guidelines and the three new \nallegations under Guideline G. Applicant did not object to the two new exhibits (8 and 9) \nthat the Government added to its Exhibit list. Thus, the Government\u2019s motion is granted. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 50, is married and has five children. (Tr. 71) He obtained his high \nschool diploma in 1989, and a barber\u2019s certificate in 2014. Applicant completed his most \nrecent security clearance application (SCA) on March 28, 2019. He has held a security \nclearance since 1993. (GE 1) He has been employed with his current employer since \n2018. (Tr. 33) Applicant was previously employed with the U.S. Government for almost \n20 years. He left in 2013 to care for his father. (Tr. 73) \nThe SOR alleges (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g) that Applicant filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy \nprotection on or about April 2015 and was discharged in July 2015; that he has a charged-\noff account in the amount of $26, 291; that he is indebted on a charged-off account in the \namount of $7,050; that he is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $5,050; \nthat he is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $1,628; that he is indebted \non a collection account in the $809; and that he is indebted on a collection account in the \namount of $607. \nFINANCIAL \nApplicant acknowledged his financial hardship over the past years beginning in \nApril 2015, when he filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy protection. (GE 6) He left Government \nservice and decided to start his own trucking business in 2013, which was not successful. \nThe business failed after 18 months. He used retirement funds from his government Thrift \nSavings Plan (TSP) and credit cards because he could not get a business loan. He \nestimates the personal cost to him was about $75,000. At the same time, renters in a \ntownhouse that he owned, vacated the premises due to their job loss. He could not sell \nthe rental property, and he defaulted on the mortgage. (Tr. 75-77) After consulting with \nhis attorney, Applicant and his wife separately filed for bankruptcy. (GE 6; (AE I) (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a) Applicant reported the bankruptcy on his May 2015 SCA.

He received funds from his wife and his \nfather. He purchased a used vehicle that met state requirements for a \u201cdriver for hire.\u201d \nThe business was initially successful; he hired drivers and two additional used cars. The \nuse of UBER and other larger commercial enterprises impacted his business, and by late \n2018, the business failed. After the business failed, he sold the vehicles. Applicant \ndefaulted on one vehicle. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) He tried to resolve this debt and the company \nasked for the full payment of $7,000. He made the first payment on July 17, 2020. He had \nto stop the payments, and eventually renegotiated a settlement agreement. (AE A) This \naccount is settled in full. (Tr.84) \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.c, a charged-off account in the amount of $7,050. This debt was \npart of a default on a second loan for the transportation business that failed.

(AE A, AE G) \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.d, a collection account in the amount of $5,050. This is a duplicate \nof the account in 1.c. It is resolved. (AE D) \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.e, a collection account in the approximate amount of $1,628. This \naccount was a credit card used for incidental expenses used in the transportation \nbusiness. It was paid in October 2019. (AE B, AE F) \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.f, a collection account in the approximate amount of $809. Applicant \nadmits that this insurance account was for the drivers that he employed in his \ntransportation business. He cancelled the insurance policy, but had no idea that he owed \nthem any balance. He learned about the debt when he was notified by the government \ninvestigator. Applicant contacted the collection agency and set up a payment plan. SOR \n\u00b6 1.g is the same insurance company, and both debts were resolved in June 2019. (AE \nI) He received some gift money from relatives to pay the debts.  (Tr. 154) \nApplicant received financial counseling as part of the bankruptcy process and has \na budget. He has limited his expenses and has no new debts. He and his wife are now \ngainfully employed, however they maintain separate finances. Applicant earns about \n$100,000 a year, and his wife also makes over $100,000. He submitted a personal \nbudget. (AE J) \nPersonal Conduct \nThe SOR (2.a-c) alleged that Applicant falsified material facts on his March 2019 \nSCA, in response to Section 26 (delinquent accounts), in the past seven years had bills \nor debts been turned over to a collection agency; that Applicant falsified material facts on \nhis March 2019 SCA in response to Section 26 (financial record), had he filed a petition \nunder any chapter of the bankruptcy code; and information concerning alcohol events as \nset forth under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was credible in his statement that he properly disclosed his finances on \nhis 2019 (SCA), even though he stated \u201cno\u201d to the questions in Section 26. He stated it \nwas the result of human error and was an embarrassing mistake. Also, his company \nFacility Security Officer (FSO) returned the document to Applicant for some questions \nand was told to de-select all of the \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answers to redo each of them. He admits \nhe was sloppy and rushed through it and did not carefully re-address Section 26 \nconcerning a bankruptcy. But when he first returned the 2015 SCA to his FSO, he \ndisclosed the bankruptcy. (AE J; Tr. 89) When Applicant completed the 2019 SCA, he \nadmitted that he used the archived copy of the 2015 SCA as the foundation. He was \nadamant that he did not intentionally falsify his 2019 SCA. He takes full responsibility. \n(Tr.92) \nAs to the issues alleged in 3.a and 3.b regarding alcohol, Applicant admitted that \nhe did not report the May 2015 allegation on his 2019 SCA, but it was not intentional or \ndeliberate. The September 2019 incident was not reported, as the 2019 SCA was \nsubmitted before the incident occurred (about six months) He notified his supervisor and \nhis supervisor notified the FSO. He was never instructed to update the security \npaperwork. Furthermore, the charges were dismissed, and he did not recall them on his \n2019 SCA. It was dumb according to Applicant, but it was not intentional. \nA witness, who testified at the hearing, an FSO who has had a security clearance \nfor 20 years, was Applicant\u2019s supervisor in 2018. (Tr. 31) She explained in great detail the \nprocess when she reviews an SCA for accuracy and completeness. She examined the \n2019 SCA, and no red flags appeared. However, she explained that when an SCA is \nreturned for any missing information, it does not reset any \u201cno\u201d questions. Only \u201cyes\u201d. \nThus, an Applicant has to go back and reset all questions that require a yes or no answer. \n(Tr. 35) The witness explained that this type of problem happens every day and is a flaw \nin the system. If the Applicant originally answered yes to a question, if the SCA is returned \nfor any reason, one could forget to do it again. She emphasized that this happens all the \ntime. (Tr. 36) The witness stated that this issue has been raised repeatedly at meetings \nas it can become a major issue for an applicant. The witness has daily interaction with \nApplicant. She performed his recent evaluation, and he scored the highest level on the \nscale. (Tr. 38) She has no concerns about his personal conduct. (Tr. 41-43) Applicant \ndenied that he intentionally falsified his 2019 SCA in his answer, and in his testimony at \nthe hearing. His witness testimony provides a credible reason, in addition to Applicant\u2019s \ncredibility, that he did not intentionally falsify his 2019 SCA.  \nA witness for the Applicant, who has had a top secret clearance since 1999, hired \nApplicant in 2018. (Tr. 53) He highly recommends Applicant and has never seen anything \nthat would concern him about Applicant and his use of alcohol. (Tr. 54) He attested that \nhe has never seen Applicant arrive to work under the influence of alcohol or observed \nany misconduct. Applicant has consistently achieved exemplary reviews. Applicant spoke \nto the witness about his financial issues, and the witness believed it was fairly standard \nbusiness issues that went wrong. (Tr. 56) There was no suspicious issues such as \ngambling or living extravagantly. He has never had a reason to terminate applicant for \nany reason. He described in great detail the same problem with the SCA that the other \nwitness did. (Tr. 61-65) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted four character references from colleagues who have known \nhim almost 20 years.

He was pulled over by the police for not using a turn signal. (GE 5) He agreed to \nalcohol testing. One police report stated that he refused a breath test. He has a torn \nmeniscus in both knees (AE N) and struggled with the physical test. This was reported on \nhis 2015 SCA. (AE J; Tr.93)  Applicant attempted the various tests and at the end stated \nthat his knees hurt and requested medical attention. (GE 5) Applicant told the officer that \nhe took medication.

He attended an all-day work conference lasting about 12 \nhours. He felt exhausted and not well, and pulled over in a residential area and parked. \nHe had consumed two glasses of wine. There are company imposed limits on the amount \nof alcohol an employee can drink while at a work conference, which was confirmed by his \nwitness. Applicant has a severe case of gastric acid reflux (GERD). He felt bloated and \nsince he was in his own car, he unbuckled his pants and unbuttoned his shirt. (Tr.109 His \nintent was to take a short nap. An officer knocked on the car window and Applicant told \nhim he was not feeling well, had GERD, and was pre-diabetic. (AE M-N) He was arrested \nand taken to the detention center and was released. No alcohol tests were given. \nApplicant told his supervisor, who notified the company FSO.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n6 \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO \n10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAfter a 20-year career in Government service Applicant retired. He wanted to be \nclose to his ill father and start his own company. Applicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by \nhis credit reports, establish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) \n(\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant filed bankruptcy in 2015 and it was discharged in 2015.

For \nthese reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g for Applicant. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s alleged deliberate falsification of his SCA, the following \ndisqualifying condition could apply: \nAG \u00b6 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant denied that he falsified his 2019 SCA, in his answer, and in his remarks \nat the hearing. An omission, standing alone, does not prove a falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.1  An applicant\u2019s level of education \nand business experience are relevant to determining whether a failure to disclose relevant \ninformation on an SCA was deliberate. 2   \nIn this instance, it is clear from Applicant\u2019s comments that he made a mistake when \ncompleting the 2019 SCA. His witnesses described the common error when an applicant \nhas an application returned and what happens to \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d answers. He used his \n2015 SCA, but rushed. Applicant was credible in his explanation and his answer was \nbolstered by the two witnesses. I find insufficient evidence of an intent by Applicant to \n1 See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd.

Five conditions may apply: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant admitted the incidents occurred, and the burden shifts to Applicant to \nmitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying.

He was credible in his explanations \nconcerning the incidents. Each case was dismissed. When he was a government \nemployee, he reported the incidents to his supervisor. As a private employee, he also \nreported the incidents. \nApplicant acknowledges that he occasionally drinks wine. He was credible in his \ndescription of being pulled over by police officers and feels that perhaps he is being \ntargeted in certain areas. (Tr.155) He has never been diagnosed as an alcohol abuser \nor dependent. His latest incident was in September 2019 (drunk in public) which was \ndismissed. He completed the probation before judgment requirements in terms of parole \nsuccessfully. Applicant has mitigated the security concern under the alcohol guideline. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F, E, and G in my whole-\nperson analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F, E, and G and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, including Applicant\u2019s credibility and \nopenness at the hearing, I conclude that Applicant did not deliberately falsify his SCA, he \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhas mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial indebtedness, personal \nconduct, and alcohol consumption. Accordingly, Applicant has carried his burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.g: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - c: \nFor Applicant \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a - e: \nFor Applicant \n Paragraph 3, Guideline G (Alcohol) \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information.

(Item 4 at 3) In his SOR Response, Applicant noted that he had recently \n\u201cseparated from [his] wife,\u201d and intended to downsize until he made ends meet. (Item 2) \nHe included a March 2021 final divorce order with his FORM response. (Item A). It reflects \nthat Applicant and his wife married in September 2017, and last cohabitated in early \nMarch 2019. The divorce petition was filed by his wife. (Item A). \nIn his FORM Response, Applicant said he had paid off most of his debts and was \nworking on the rest. The financial impact of his recent divorce is unclear.

(AE A) \nApplicant\u2019s debts predate his divorce. He indicated in his background interview that \nhe fell behind on his debts when he gave money to his parents when they were in financial \nneed. (Item 4) The SOR alleges that Applicant has incurred just under $37,000 in \ndelinquent debt. (Item 1) The debts are listed on an October 2019 credit report.

(Item 6) This debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($2,896) is a debt placed in collection by a consumer account or a bank. \nApplicant said he received a settlement offer but had not addressed it. He planned to pay \na small amount off each month. This debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($2,281) is a debt placed in collection by a phone company. Applicant \nasserts that the debt relates to an allegation from the creditor that he did not return certain \nequipment. Applicant intended to resolve the debt with his tax refund. This debt is not \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($1,803) is a debt placed in collection by a bank. Applicant intended to \nresolve the debt once he paid his taxes.

(Item 6) This debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($4,167) is a debt that has been charged off. Applicant admits the debt \nand said he would pay it. The debt is listed on Item 5, his October 2019 credit bureau \nreport, as having been transferred or sold, but the creditor is not identified, and no balance \nis listed. The debt is not listed on a more recent credit report, Item 6. As no balance is \nindicated, the debt is considered resolved. \nApplicant\u2019s September 2021 submissions included a narrative statement about his \nexpenses and debt repayment plan. (AE E) He pays $650 a month in rent, has a $700\nmonthly car payment, pays $264 in insurance, $86 for a cell phone, and about $215 for \ncable and internet, expenses totaling $1,915 per month. Other basic monthly staples,\nsuch as food, utilities, and gas for his car, are not noted. (AE E) He included a bimonthly\npaystub for August 2021. He earned gross income of about $2,921, and net income of \nabout $2,088 bimonthly (or $4,176 per month). (AE F) For 2021 to that point (eight\nmonths), he had earned a gross total income of about $46,055. (AE F) This suggests a\ntotal annual gross income for 2021 of just over $69,000. ($46,055 divided by 8 months = \n$5,756.87, and $5,756.87 times 12 months = $69,082.50). \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn September 2021, Applicant indicated that he had $7,054 with which to pay his \nremaining debts (the \u201cfull amount\u201d) by the end of November 2021, instead of paying $258 \nper month for three years. He also said that he planned to refinance his auto. (AE E) \nGiven this representation from Applicant, I reopened the record again, on \nNovember 16, 2021, until November 30, 2021, to allow him to submit documentation of \nany additional payments towards his SOR debts. (HE III) The same day, Applicant \nresponded and reported that in early October 2021, he had been injured in an auto \naccident. He said that his injuries have left him unable to work at least for the time being, \nas he requires digital dexterity to fire a weapon in order to work as an armed security \nguard. His post-accident medical treatment is ongoing; it will be followed by physical \ntherapy as he attempts to qualify to return to his job. He is currently out of work, with no \nshort-term or long-term disability. His repayment plan for his SOR debts is therefore on \nhold, as his savings are used for his everyday bills.

As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nApplicant is employed as a security guard with a government contractor. He works \nat another U.S. government agency. Under DOD Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 2.2, that federal \nagency is among those that have an agreement with the DOD under which DOHA is to \nadjudicate security clearance cases such as Applicant\u2019s. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has incurred just under $37,000 in delinquent debt. He admitted all the \ndebts, and they are established by an October 2019 credit report. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \napply. \nSecurity concerns having been raised, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of \ndisproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. \nBd. Sept. 22, 2005)). Applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of explanation, \nextenuation, or mitigation to overcome the financial considerations security concerns. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant had been gainfully employed as a security officer for about 16 years, \nuntil his recent accident rendered him unable to work, at least temporarily. Some of his \ndebts are resolved, but others are ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not fully apply. \nApplicant\u2019s debts appear to have occurred because he fell behind on his accounts \nafter helping his parents out financially. To some extent, this was a circumstance beyond \nhis control. Applicant has also been through a recent divorce, though it is not clear that \nthe divorce had a significant financial impact on him. However, in considering application \nof this mitigating condition, his recent, unforeseen accident has left him unable to work \nand to address his debts. This is clearly a circumstance beyond his control that is \nimpacting his finances and his ability to address them. AG \u00b6 20(b) therefore has some \napplication. \nApplicant has resolved about half of his debts, as he settled his largest debt (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a), paid another through garnishment several years ago (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and paid another \ndebt recently. (SOR \u00b6 1.g) The debt at SOR \u00b6 1.i, transferred or sold with a zero balance, \nis resolved. He declared an intention to resolve his remaining debts, by downsizing and \nreducing his expenses. Applicant had a reasonable plan in place before his recent \naccident. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

My comments under Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant established that a significant portion of his SOR debts have been \nresolved. They are due to a variety of circumstances, including supporting his parents \nfinancially, perhaps when he was unable to afford to do so. He has also been through a \nrecent divorce, though the financial impact of this event is not\\ clear. His recent accident \nhas left him unable to work and to address his remaining debts. Given his documented \nefforts in resolving his SOR debts and reducing his overall debt load and his long career \nas a security officer at his current position, I believe he has carried his burden of mitigating \nthe financial security concern shown by his debts, some of which remain. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nBraden M.

He is employed by a defense contractor as a Field Mechanic. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The SOR alleges that the Applicant is indebted to the state and Federal Government for delinquent tax owed for years 2012 through 2015, failure to file his state and Federal income tax returns for tax years 2016 and 2017, and sixteen delinquent debts owed to creditors totaling approximately $106,125. Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR. Credit reports of the Applicant dated October 24, 2018; September 5, 2019; January 7, 2021; and June 29, 2021, confirm the indebtedness. (Government Exhibits 4, 5, 6, and 7.) Applicant served in the U.S. Marine Corps from March 1996 to March 2001, and received an honorable discharge. (Government Exhibit 3.)

He is employed by a defense \ncontractor as a Field Mechanic. \nHe is seeking to obtain a security clearance in \nconnection with his employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR alleges that the Applicant is indebted to the state and Federal \nGovernment for delinquent tax owed for years 2012 through 2015, failure to file his state \nand Federal income tax returns for tax years 2016 and 2017, and sixteen delinquent \ndebts owed to creditors totaling approximately $106,125. Applicant admits each of the \nallegations set forth in the SOR. Credit reports of the Applicant dated October 24, 2018; \nSeptember 5, 2019; January 7, 2021; and June 29, 2021, confirm the indebtedness. \n(Government Exhibits 4, 5, 6, and 7.) \nApplicant served in the U.S. Marine Corps from March 1996 to March 2001, and \nreceived an honorable discharge. (Government Exhibit 3.) Applicant began working for \nhis current employer in November 2016. He has had consistent employment since \nthen, with no period of unemployment. \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant attributes his financial problems to the \nemotional, mental, and physical aftermath of the death of two of his sons in 2012. \nEvidence in the record suggests that Applicant\u2019s financial problems began prior to and \nwere unrelated to his sons deaths, as a $42,463 Federal tax lien was entered against \nApplicant in March 2012. Applicant states that since then, his wife has been unable to \nreturn to the workforce full time. \nApplicant has been and continues to be the \nhousehold\u2019s primary breadwinner. In 2013, through no fault of his own, his employment \ncontract changed and drastically recued his income, but not the taxes owed. Over the \npast nine years, Applicant has consistently been unable to meet his financial \nobligations. The following delinquent debts set forth in the SOR are of security concern: \n1.a. A delinquent judgment entered against the Applicant on October 13, 2006, is owed \nto a County in the amount of $768 and remains owing. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n1.b.

A delinquent debt is owed to a credit union for an account that was charged off in \nthe approximate amount of $9,927. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to\nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.\nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including\nespionage. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;   \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts include $80,000 in consumer debt. He also failed to \nfile his state and Federal income tax returns in a timely basis for various years. In \naddition, he failed to pay his state and Federal income tax for various tax years. His \nback taxes total approximately $26,000. \nHis total indebtedness currently exceeds \n$106,000. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20; \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant is delinquently indebted to each of the creditors set forth in the SOR. \nHe also failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns required by law.  He states \nthat his employment contract change has reduced his income, and he has struggled to \npay his debts. It is unclear why he has not filed the Federal and state income tax \nreturns in question. In any case, Applicant failed to respond to the FORM, and has \nprovided no evidence in mitigation. He has made no effort to resolve his delinquent \ndebt. He has not shown that he has filed the income tax returns in question. Given his \nexperience and military background, Applicant is aware of the legal requirement to file \nannual Federal and state income tax returns and pay Federal and state taxes in a timely \nfashion. Applicant simply may not be able to afford to pay his debts. In this instance, \ninaction for so long reflects a pattern of unreliability, untrustworthiness, and poor \njudgment. Accordingly, Applicant does not meet the requirements to access classified \ninformation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.t: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

The case was assigned to me on February 25, 2021. Without objections, I \nadmitted and considered the Government\u2019s proposed evidence. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent accounts in collection or charged off, totaling \nabout $23,419. In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted 10 of the financial allegations \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i and 1.m). He denied the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j \nthrough 1.l. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough \nreview of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 38-year-old aircraft mechanic. He is a high school graduate. He \nenlisted in the U.S. Air Force in December 2002, and served honorably on active duty \nuntil his discharge in February 2017. He possessed a security clearance during most of \nhis service. \nApplicant married in 2004 and divorced in July 2012. He remarried in December \n2012, separated in May 2016, and divorced in April 2019. He disclosed having no \nchildren in his 2019 SCA. However, Applicant told the government background \ninvestigator during his June 2019 interview that he has two children (ages unknown) for \nwhom he provides financial support. \nIn January 2017, Applicant was hired by his current employer and security \nsponsor, a federal contractor. In response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his March \n2019 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had financial problems, which included \narrearages on his children\u2019s financial support, owing money to the Defense Finance and \nAccounting Service (DFAS) for an overpayment, and another delinquent account. \nApplicant explained that his financial problems started when he and his second \nwife returned to the United States from an overseas assignment. Apparently, their \nearnings decreased when they lost their overseas cost of living allowance. Additionally, \nupon their return, they separated and he was financially responsible for two households. \nDuring the marital separation, from May 2016 through April 2019, Applicant agreed to \nprovide monthly financial support of $900 - $1,000 for his two children. When the court \nfinalized the divorce, he was ordered to provide $2,262 in monthly child support, \nretroactively.

This is a collection account for $2,132. (Item 6) The account is unresolved. \n1.d. This was a collection on behalf of a communications provider for $595. \nApplicant settled the account for less than owed and paid it off in September 2020. \n(Item 6) \n1.e.

This was a past-due account with a total balance of $5,068. Applicant paid it \noff in September 2020. (Item 6) \n1.h. This was a past-due account with a total balance of $4,130. The credit \nreports reflect several account for A. F. Bank (all of which have been paid and closed) \nand several accounts for A. F. Loans (all of which shows that the accounts are being \npaid as agreed). It is not clear from the evidence presented what account was alleged \nas delinquent. Regardless, the accounts are either current or paid off. \n1.i. This is a collection on behalf of a lender for $1,955. The credit report from \nDecember 2020 (Item 6) shows the account is still outstanding. \n1.j. This is a collection on behalf of communications provider for $744.

Applicant claimed he paid the account and \nit is reflected as paid in the May 2019 and December 2020 credit reports. The account \nis resolved. \nDuring his June 2019 interview, Applicant told the investigator that he was \nmaking $7,400 in monthly income: $4,400 from his current employment, and $3,000 \nfrom the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). In addition to the $2,262 monthly child \nsupport payments, he disclosed the following monthly expenses: $1,500 in rent and \nutilities; $200 for food and groceries; $350 for car payment; $200 for gas; $675 in car \nand renters\u2019 insurance; $230 in loan payments; $190 cell phone payment; $200 for \ninternet and cable; $60 on miscellaneous subscriptions; and $100-$200 in children \nvisitation expenses. Applicant has about $1,300 of discretionary income after paying his \nmonthly expenses. (Item 3) \nApplicant believes that his financial situation is stable. He is current with his \npresent financial obligations and promised to continue to meet them. He also promised \nto continue paying his delinquent accounts with his discretionary income until they are \nresolved. In his SOR answer, Applicant claimed the he had contacted his creditors to \neither resolve or make arrangements to resolve his delinquencies. He did not submit \ndocumentary evidence to corroborate his efforts to contact all of his creditors. \nNevertheless, the credit reports in evidence corroborate his contacts with creditors and \nthe payment or resolution of at least nine SOR debts. \nApplicant accepted responsibility for his delinquent accounts. He admitted that \nafter his divorce he failed to follow up on many of the delinquent accounts because he \nbelieved they were his ex-wife\u2019s accounts. Applicant\u2019s credit reports show that he is \nliving within his financial means, and that he has acquired no additional delinquent \naccounts. Although Applicant presented no evidence to show he has received financial \ncounseling, he has been paying his delinquent accounts. \nApplicant\u2019s current job allows him to meet his financial obligations and living \nexpenses. His credit reports show that he has paid or resolved nine of the 13 accounts \nalleged in the SOR, paying approximately $11,799. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.h and 1.j \nthrough 1.m). He has yet to resolve the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c and \n1.i, totaling about $11,620. Applicant promised to pay all of his remaining delinquent \naccounts. Because he already paid nine delinquent accounts, I find his promise to pay \nthe remaining delinquent accounts credible. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a \ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing \naccess to classified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense consideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. \nA \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. He was separated \nfrom his wife between May 2016 and April 2019, when his divorce became final. He also \nwas discharged from the service after 15 years on active duty in February 2017. \nBecause of his reduced earnings, separation, and divorce, he acquired 13 delinquent \naccounts, some of which were charged off. AG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions \nthat could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to \nsatisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record \nestablished these disqualifying conditions, requiring additional inquiry about the possible \napplicability of mitigating conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAll of these mitigating conditions are partially or fully supported by the facts in this \ncase. Applicant developed financial problems after he relocated back to the United \nStates from an overseas assignment and his earnings were reduced. Additionally, his \nlengthy marital separation leading to his divorce, and his discharge from the service \nwere contributing factors to his financial problems. His income was insufficient to \nsupport two households, he could not pay his living expenses and accrued the \ndelinquent debts. Thus, I find that his financial problems could be attributed to, or were \naggravated by, circumstances beyond his control. \nBoth the April and May 2019 credit reports show that Applicant was making \npayments on charged-off accounts before his SOR was issued in September 2020. \nAlthough Applicant could have been more diligent addressing his charged-off accounts, \nI find that he has been financially responsible under his circumstances. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. \nAn applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of \nsuch debts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to resolve \nfinancial issues in the future, without further confirmed action, are insufficient. \nIn this instance, there is no evidence of prior financial problems; circumstances \nbeyond his control contributed to his financial problems; he started to resolve his \ndelinquent accounts before the SOR was issued; he has paid 9 of the 13 delinquent \nSOR accounts; and he has acquired no additional delinquencies. I further find that \nApplicant has established a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent debts. His actions \nare sufficient to demonstrate his current financial responsibility, and that his financial \nproblems are being resolved and are under control. Applicant promised the government \ninvestigator to pay all of his delinquent accounts. Because he already paid nine \ndelinquent accounts, I find it likely that he would pay the remaining delinquent accounts. \nThe financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \nApplicant, 38, served on active duty for 15 years and was honorably discharged. \nHe held a clearance while in the service. There is no evidence of any security concerns, \nexcept for those in the current SOR. He has been employed with a federal contractor \nsince January 2017. \nOn balance, Applicant\u2019s evidence is sufficient to establish that circumstances \nbeyond his control contributed to or aggravated his financial problems. After that, he has \nbeen financially responsible addressing his delinquent accounts within his financial \nmeans. He has established a viable plan to resolve the accounts alleged in the SOR. \nHe resolved or paid 9 of the 13 SOR accounts. He is in control of his finances. Given \nthe opportunity, I believe that Applicant would resolve or pay all of the accounts alleged \nin the SOR. \nBecause of his service, experience possessing a security clearance, and the \nsecurity clearance process he went through to renew his clearance eligibility, Applicant \nlikely understands that if he fails to establish and maintain his financial responsibility, he \nwould be considered ineligible for a clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.m: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a federal contractor performing the duties \nof an administrative assistant. She began working at her present job in June 2019. She \nhas taken some college courses for which she incurred the student loans that are \ndiscussed below. She is twice married, most recently in May 2019. She married for the \nfirst time in 1998 and divorced in 2011. She has five children from her first marriage, ages \n28, 23, 22, 17, and 17 (18 in October). Applicant currently only provides financial support \nfor one child. She receives $250 monthly in child support from her ex-husband. (Tr. 6, 18-\n20, 22; GE 1) \n \nThe SOR alleged 25 delinquent accounts (student loans, medical, and consumer \ndebts) totaling approximately $60,624. The debts are established by credit reports from \nSeptember 2019, November 2020, and June 2021; Applicant\u2019s personal subject interview \n(PSI) with a defense investigator in October 2019; and her SOR admissions. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \n\u2013 1.y) (AE 2-5; Answer to SOR) \n \nApplicant explained that her financial difficulties began during her first marriage \nwhen her ex-husband controlled all financial decisions. When he left her, she discovered \nthat all the bills were in arrears by two months. They divorced in 2010 and she became a \nsingle mother with five children to support. Her ex-husband failed to pay child support for \napproximately seven years. He now pays $250 monthly for the one minor child living with \nApplicant, as noted above. He has been assessed arrears for past-due child support, but \nApplicant has chosen not to enforce that order until her minor child is emancipated. \nApplicant claimed that their divorce decree required her ex-husband to pay half of all the \nchildren\u2019s medical expenses, which he failed to do. My review of the divorce decree did \nnot find such a provision. A 2018 modification order requires Applicant to maintain health \ninsurance for two children and pay the associated premiums. The ex-husband is required \nto pay 80 percent of any uninsured health care costs for the children. The original 2010 \ndivorce decree does not address this issue. Applicant explained that she could not \naddress her debts after the divorce because she needed to concentrate her efforts on \nsupporting her children. Other than a month-and-one-half period of unemployment in \n2016, she has been steadily employed. (Tr. 6, 18-20, 23-25 30-31; AE A) \nThe status of the SOR debts is as follows: \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f-$3,335; $9,183; $2,593; $2,593; $2,389; $5,251. According to \nApplicant, she incurred her student loans in approximately 2000 and 2004. Her \nSeptember 2019 credit report shows that these student loans were opened in either 2009 \nor 2010. This same credit report indicates that all the loans were in a 120-days past due \nstatus. In her October 2019 PSI, she acknowledged the debts and that she had been \n\u201cdeferring\u201d them because she could not make the required payments. In her hearing \ntestimony, she stated she had not made a payment in over five years and she reiterated \nthat her loans were on a continuing deferred status (she specifically stated she was not \ntalking about the CARES Act deferment resulting from the COVID-19 legislation). She \nfurther stated she could provide documentation of her deferments and documents \nshowing the current status of her student loans. She failed to provide any supporting \ndocumentation before the record closed on August 6, 2021. She claims that she will begin \nmaking $250 monthly payments beginning in October 2021. These debts are unresolved. \n(Tr. 26-28, 37; GE 2-3) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g-$446. This is a cable TV debt. This debt was assigned for collection in\nAugust 2017.

According to Applicant, these are all medical debts incurred by her children. \nShe claims, pursuant to their divorce decree, her ex-husband is required to pay half of all \nthese medical debts.

(Tr. 35) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred multiple delinquent debts including student loans, of which all \nremain unpaid or unresolved. I find both disqualifying conditions are raised. \nAlthough President Biden extended a pause on the collection of student loans due \nto COVID-19, thus creating a deferment period on student-loan payments \n(https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/pausing-\n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstudent-loan-payments/), that action does not excuse previously delinquent student \nloans. (See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021)) Therefore, Applicant \nis still responsible for them. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and    \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent because they are ongoing and unaddressed. She \nfailed to produce evidence showing that recurrence of her financial problems is unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \nApplicant experienced financial difficulties from her divorce in 2010 and having to \nraise five children on her own and a short period of unemployment. These were \ncircumstances beyond her control. However, she did not act responsibly by taking little, if \nany action, to resolve these debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully applicable. \nApplicant did not present evidence of financial counseling. Her track record to date \ndoes not support a good financial picture. Additionally, she failed to put forth a good-faith \neffort to resolve her debts. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control. She also \nfailed to present documentation supporting her disputed debts.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s marital difficulties and the circumstances surrounding her \nindebtedness. However, I also considered that she has made insufficient efforts to resolve \nher debts. She has not established a meaningful track record of debt management, which \ncauses me to question her ability to resolve her debts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I \nconsidered the exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Appendix \nC, dated June 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.y: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

This \nallegation is found for Applicant. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had an automobile repossessed, and other significant past-due debt. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has addressed all of his alleged past-due debt, and has demonstrated \nthat future financial problems are unlikely. Applicant attributed his recent delinquencies \nto the four year period of unemployment or underemployment that Applicant endured \nafter he left active duty with the U.S. Navy. These are circumstances beyond his control. \nMitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has been established. Financial Considerations is found for \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.e: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 40, divorced his wife of 12 years in 2016. He remarried in 2017. He has three minor children born of his first marriage. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2013. He has been steadily employed full time since 2009, including with his current defense-contractor employer as of 2018. Although he has been employed by at least one other defense contractor, he did not report having previously held a security clearance. (Item 3) The SOR, as amended, alleged nine delinquent debts totaling $61,321, including three student-loan accounts totaling $27,997 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, and 1.g), one $10,671 automobile-loan account (SOR \u00b6 1.b), four credit-card accounts totaling $22,507 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.e and 1.l), and one $146 consumer account (SOR \u00b6 1.k).

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 30, 2018. On \nSeptember 1, 2020, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nthe DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on a date not reflected in the record, and requested \na decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On October 30, 2020, the \nGovernment sent Applicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM), including evidentiary documents identified as Items 1 through 7.

I sustained Applicant\u2019s objection to Item \n4 and neither considered nor admitted it into evidence. Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer and \nFORM response included evidentiary documents that I admitted into evidence as \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A through G. The case was assigned to me on November 24, \n2020. \nProcedural Matter \nOn December 10, 2020, the Government proffered revisions to the FORM due to \ninadvertent typographical errors. With notice to Applicant, I noted the revisions for the \nrecord and appended the related documents to the record as Administrative Exhibit \n(AE) I. \nEvidentiary Matter \nThe Government amended the SOR to withdraw allegation \u00b6 1.h. Thus, SOR \u00b6 \n1.h will neither be considered nor adjudicated.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 40, divorced his wife of 12 years in 2016. He remarried in 2017. \nHe has three minor children born of his first marriage. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2013. He has been steadily employed full time since 2009, including with his current \ndefense-contractor employer as of 2018. Although he has been employed by at least \none other defense contractor, he did not report having previously held a security \nclearance. (Item 3) \nThe SOR, as amended, alleged nine delinquent debts totaling $61,321, including \nthree student-loan accounts totaling $27,997 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, and 1.g), one $10,671 \nautomobile-loan account (SOR \u00b6 1.b), four credit-card accounts totaling $22,507 (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.e and 1.l), and one $146 consumer account (SOR \u00b6 1.k). The SOR also \nalleged two credit-card accounts that were charged off for unspecified amounts \u2013 SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j \u2013 both of which were referred to collections as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and \n1.d, respectively. In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all but two of the 11 SOR \nallegations: SOR \u00b6 1.a ($21,696) and 1.f ($4,392). Each SOR allegation was confirmed \nby the credit reports. (Items 2, 3, 6-8) \nApplicant has been making monthly payments of $200 to $300 since September \n2018 towards the federal student-loan debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.f. He \nsuccessfully rehabilitated these two loans in June 2019. He has not made any \npayments toward any of his other debts, including the private student-loan account \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, which remain unresolved. (Item 2; AE B, F, G) \nApplicant initially contended that he could not afford to pay the remaining debts. \nIn his SCA, he stated that \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ok to be delinquent and have every intention \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto fix the issue.\u201d However, in his SOR answer, he stated that he does not intend to pay \nthem because it is \u201cnot financially advantageous.\u201d He is concerned that, because so \nmuch time has passed since the debts were incurred, he risks further damage to his \ncredit score if he were to pay them now. In his FORM response, he declared \u201cI am in a \nbetter financial position.\u201d However, based on credit advisors with whom he has spoken, \nhe believes it \u201cmakes more financial sense\u201d to wait for his delinquent debts to age off of \nhis credit report rather than pay them. (FORM Response; Item 2; Item 3 at 44-48) \nApplicant attributes his indebtedness primarily to financial problems that arose \nduring his first marriage and the costs associated with relocations and his divorce. His \nfirst wife did not work outside of the home in order to raise their children (as they had \nagreed), so they relied solely on Applicant\u2019s income. As their family grew, it became \nincreasingly difficult to maintain financial stability. Their finances became strained \nbeginning in 2012. They chose not to file bankruptcy and, instead, \u201ctried very hard\u201d to \nkeep up with their financial obligations. By 2014, they were no longer able to maintain \ntheir finances. He and his first wife disagreed with how to manage and budget their \nfinances, which was a factor in the divorce. They initially separated in 2015. (Item 2) \nThe marital debts (including state and federal taxes that were neither alleged nor \notherwise detailed in the record) were assigned to Applicant in the divorce. He did not \ncontest that assignment to avoid a prolonged court battle and limit the emotional toll on \nhis children. Applicant and his new wife have agreed upon a solid budget plan to \nmanage their finances. Since he remarried, Applicant averred that he has timely paid \nhis expenses, not incurred any new debts, and been able to raise his credit score. His \nSeptember 2018 and October 2020 credit reports both showed an automobile-loan \naccount that was past due in the amount of $510. Applicant travelled on cruises in April \n2017 and April 2018. (Item 2; Item 3 at 36-38; Item 7 at 4-5; AE A) \nApplicant accepted responsibility for his accumulation of debt. He asserted that \nhe has learned from his financial \u201cmistakes.\u201d Following his divorce, he developed a \nfinancial management database that he uses to maintain his finances. He and his new \nwife live below their means and are committed to being financially responsible. He \nreceived the \u201chighest score possible\u201d from his employer on his 2019 performance \nreview. His work ethic and character were lauded by a colleague, his wife (who is also a \ncolleague), and his mother-in-law. He assisted his mother-in-law in establishing a \nbudget by sharing his database and the lessons he learned to maintain control of his \nown finances. With his help, she eliminated her debt within a few short months, enabling \nher to retire earlier than anticipated. He also educated her on how to save and spend \nwisely. (Item 2, AE C-E) \nThe record contains scant details about Applicant\u2019s relevant income and expense \nhistory, including the costs associated with his relocations and divorce. He relocated in \nJanuary 2015 to move closer to family due to his brother\u2019s ailing health and to receive \nthe support of family while he and his first wife struggled with their marriage. In \nDecember 2015, he relocated for a \u201cbetter\u201d employment opportunity. He relocated in \nJune 2018 after his company announced layoffs. Applicant asserted that the cost of the \nmove associated with first relocation led his finances on a \u201cdownward spiral of falling \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbehind on payments.\u201d For his third relocation, he incurred \u201cthousands in costs\u201d while \nalso paying for two homes until the sale of his former primary residence in August 2018. \nIn 2016, Applicant began paying 30% of his income for child support prior to a court \norder. The record does not indicate whether that amount changed following the divorce. \n(Item 2; Item 3 at 9-11, 43-48) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and his credit reports establish the following disqualifying \nconditions: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); AG \u00b6 19(b) (unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts regardless of the ability to do so); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations). \nThe following are potentially applicable factors that could mitigate the security \nconcerns raised in the SOR: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant successfully rehabilitated the federal student-loan accounts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.f and has been paying them as agreed for a substantial period of \ntime. The allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j refer to the same debts as those alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.d. Thus, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, 1.i, and 1.j in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nHowever, he did not meet his burden to mitigate the remaining SOR debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant has debts totaling $35,233 that remain \nunresolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant proffered compelling circumstances \nbeyond his control that undoubtedly had both a monetary and nonmonetary impact on \nhim and his family. I considered his divorce and that he did not acquire the marital debts \nalone. However, he did not meet his burden to establish that his delinquent debts have \npersisted largely due to those circumstances, or that he acted responsibly to address \nthem. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant consulted with credit advisors and \ndeveloped a financial management database. He learned enough about finances to \navoid accumulating new debts and to assist his mother-in-law with gaining control of her \nown debts. However, his substantial debts remain unresolved without any resolution \nplan beyond waiting for them to age off of his credit report. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established. I credit Applicant with successfully addressing \nhis federal student-loan debts, for seeking advice from credit advisors, and for \ndeveloping tools to help him manage his finances. However, his decision not to pay his \ndelinquent debts, because doing so would not be in his best financial interest, belies a \ngood faith effort to honor his financial obligations. While relying on credit reporting rules \nand the statute of limitations could be legally permissible options for Applicant to avoid \nrepaying his debts, it raises a concern with respect to his security worthiness. As an \nindividual seeking to obtain the benefit of a privilege and not a right, he is held to a \nhigher standard for actions that might otherwise be considered innocuous in other \ncontexts. Applicant made a choice to protect his self-interest above his legal obligations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \nI am, therefore, left with doubt as to whether he may also act similarly with respect to his \nsecurity obligations. \nI have considered the progress that Applicant made in tackling his federal \nstudent-loan debts and the fact that he is not required to be debt-free in order to qualify \nfor a security clearance. However, in light of the record before me, I cannot conclude \nthat Applicant has mitigated the Guideline F concerns at this time. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his delinquent debts. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nWithdrawn by the Government \nSubparagraphs 1.i \u2013 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k \u2013 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The SOR also alleges his $115,334 \nmortgage was at least 120 days delinquent in the amount of $2,299. \nApplicant provided a screen shot from his TransUnion Credit Report showing six \nDOE/Nelnet student loans with status \u201con time\u201d and totaling $83,673 as follows: $10,674; \n$10,372; $9,986; $6,038; $5,785; and $5,274. (These amounts total $48,129?) (Tr. 34; \nAE F) In March 2019, his $676 federal income tax refund and his $321 state income tax \nrefund were diverted to address his student loan debt. (AE G) He provided eight monthly \nchecking account statements from May 2019 to December 2019 showing $5 payments \nto address his DOE student loan debts. (AE H) The payments were automatically \ndeducted from his bank account. (Tr. 28; AE H) In December 2019, a new company \npurchased his student loans, and his automatic payments from his bank stopped. (Tr. 27-\n29) In 2020, he learned Nelnet had his student loan account, and in February or March \n2020, he contacted Nelnet. (Tr. 29) Nelnet wanted $400 monthly, and Appellant said he \nis paying $20 to $25 a month. (Tr. 30) He made the payments to show his good faith. (Tr. \n34-35) He tried to maintain contact with his student loan creditors. (Tr. 26) (Q: Is he still \npaying on his student loans?) \nIn 2018, Applicant\u2019s mortgage became delinquent. (Tr. 31) His December 30, 2019 \ncredit report shows his last activity on his mortgage account was in October 2018. (Tr. \n31) He said it became delinquent because of his separation from his spouse. (Tr. 31) His \nMay 2020 mortgage statement shows his mortgage was current, and he had paid $7,303 \nin 2020 to the mortgage company. (Tr. 30; AE C) His December 2020 mortgage statement \nshows he made payments totaling $15,691 to address the mortgage, and escrow \npayments totaling $7,356 for taxes and insurance in 2020. (Id.) His monthly mortgage \nand escrow payment is $1,071. (Id.) His March 2021 mortgage statement shows a \nbalance owed on his mortgage of $110,095. (Id.) His mortgage is current. (Id.) \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income after deductions is $1,750. (Tr. 31) His monthly \nmortgage payment is $1,071. (AE C) He does not have a car payment as he purchases \nused vehicles. (Tr. 37-38) He has about $300 available after paying his expenses. (Tr. \n32) His son is (enrolled in) remote learning. Applicant is high risk because of the Corona \nVirus and works at home. (Tr. 32) Applicant would like to obtain part-time employment \nafter the economy returns to normal to increase his income. (Tr. 32) He has about $2,000 \nin a savings account and $50,000 in a retirement account. (Tr. 32-33)  \nApplicant was unemployed for a time while he cared for his son. He could have \nsought a deferment for up to three years on his student loan payments due to \nunemployment.

(AE B) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a [public trust position].\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). The Government\u2019s authority to restrict access to classified information \napplies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified information. As Commander in \nChief, the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national \nsecurity or other sensitive information and to determine whether an individual is \nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. See Id. at 527. \nThe standard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on \nall available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that \nassigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity. DOD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in \nthe Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.   \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, an \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position. See ISCR Case No. 95-\n0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his or her [access to sensitive information].\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance [or trustworthiness] determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nThe protection of the national security and sensitive records is of paramount \nconsideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national \nsecurity.\u201d Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation \nomitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise [sensitive] information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \n7 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s [eligibility for a public trust position]. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of not timely paying his mortgage \nand student loan debts when due establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s [eligibility for a public trust \nposition], there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \n[eligibility for a public trust position].

Applicant took reasonable actions to \nmaintain contact with his creditors, including making $5 monthly payments to his student-\nloan creditor. \nTwo Appeal Board decisions illustrate the analysis for applying AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and \n20(b) when an Applicant lacks the income to address debts. In ISCR Case No. 09-08533 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010), the applicant had $41,871 in delinquent credit card debt and \ndefaulted on a home loan generating a $162,000 delinquent debt. Id. at 2. That applicant \nfiled for bankruptcy the same month the Administrative Judge issued her decision. Id. at \n1-2. The applicant in ISCR Case No. 09-08533 was recently divorced, had been \nunemployed for 10 months, and had childcare responsibilities. Her former husband was \ninconsistent in his child support payments to her. The Appeal Board determined that AG \n\u00b6 20(a) was \u201cclearly applicable (debt occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and [the debt] does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment)\u201d even though that applicant\u2019s debts were unresolved \nat the time the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision was issued. Id. at 3. The Appeal Board \nalso decided that the record evidence raised the applicability of AG \u00b6 20(b) because of \nthe absence of evidence of irresponsible behavior, poor judgment, unreliability, or lack of \ntrustworthiness. Id. at 4. It is noteworthy that Applicant has the burden of proving the \napplicability of any mitigating conditions, and the burden to disprove a mitigating condition \nnever shifts to the Government. \nSimilarly, in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) the Appeal Board \naddressed a situation where an applicant was sporadically unemployed and lacked the \nability to pay his creditors. The Appeal Board noted \u201cit will be a long time at best before \nhe has paid\u201d all of his creditors. Id. at 3. The applicant was living on unemployment \ncompensation at the time of his hearing. The Appeal Board explained that such a \ncircumstance was not necessarily a bar to having access to classified information stating: \n9 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \nHowever, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required \nto be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or \nsimultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly given \nhis [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, \naccompanied by \u201cconcomitant conduct,\u201d that is, actions which evidence a \nserious intent to effectuate the plan.  \n \nThe timing of the resolution of Applicant\u2019s debts is a pertinent consideration. The \nAppeal Board has observed, \u201cApplicants who begin to resolve their debts only after having \nbeen placed on notice that their clearances or trustworthiness designations are in \njeopardy may be disinclined to follow rules and regulations when their personal interests \nare not at stake.\u201d ADP Case No. 17-00263 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 16-03122 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2018)).

The applicant in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 used his limited \nresources to (1) resolve some of his debts; (2) had a repayment plan for the remaining \ndebts; and (3) took \u201creasonable actions to effectuate that plan.\u201d Id. The Appeal Board \nremanded the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision because it did not \u201carticulate a satisfactory \nexplanation for his conclusions,\u201d emphasizing the Administrative Judge did \u201cnot explain[] \nwhat he believes that applicant could or should have done under the circumstances that \nhe has not already done to rectify his poor financial condition, or why the approach taken \nby applicant was not \u2018responsible\u2019 in light of his limited circumstances.\u201d Id.   \nThe Appeal Board has explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts under AG \u00b6 20(d): \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith requires a \nshowing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. Accordingly, an applicant \nmust do more than merely sh\n \now that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \nISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (citations, footnote, and last \nquotation marks omitted). \nAt the time of his hearing, it was evident that Applicant did not understand how to \nbring his student loans to current status. Taking into consideration the level of his \nknowledge about finances, particularly student loans, Applicant took reasonable and \nresponsible actions to resolve his debts, establishing his good faith. Based on Applicant\u2019s \ncredible and sincere promise to pay his debts and his track record of paying his debts, \n10 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfuture new delinquent debt \u201cis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on [Applicant\u2019s] \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). \nApplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) is warranted. Applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation was damaged by circumstances partially or fully beyond his control. He acted \nresponsibly by paying as many debts as possible. Although there is limited evidence of \nrecord that he established and maintained contact with his creditors, his financial problem \nis being resolved and is under control. Applicant will conscientiously endeavor to maintain \nhis financial responsibility, and he will establish a student loan payment plan and bring \nhis student loans to current status. His efforts are sufficient to mitigate financial \nconsiderations trustworthiness concerns. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a trustworthiness concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 lists one condition that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification \ncases, stating: \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as \na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred.  \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd.

Id. Additionally, the Appeal Board gives \ndeference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nADP Case No. 17-03932 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14, 2019). \nThe SOR alleges Applicant \u201cfalsified material facts\u201d in his November 19, 2018 SCA \nwhen he failed to disclose his delinquent mortgage and student loans in collections. This \nmeans the Government alleged Applicant \u201cfalsely created or altered in order to deceive.\u201d \nMerriam Webster Dictionary, available at https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ \nfalsified. Applicant admitted that he erred when he failed to disclose his delinquent student \nloan debts on his SCA. His rationale for not disclosing these delinquent debts was his \nreliance on a summary credit report, Credit Karma. Before completing his SCA, he \nchecked Credit Karma for reportable financial information. There was no mention of his \nmortgage or student loans. Applicant is unsophisticated in financial matters. \nAppellant\u2019s November 19, 2018 SCA asked whether in the previous seven years \nApplicant had any bills or debts turned over to a collection agency, or whether he had any \naccount or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed. \nIt is noteworthy, that Applicant\u2019s 2018 credit report does not indicate that DOE turned his \nstudent loans over to a collection agency. Evidently, DOE retained his student loans and \nclassified them as being in collections. It is unclear whether DOE engages in collection \nactivity. His credit report only put one medical account in the collections part of the report, \nand Applicant disclosed that debt on his SCA. \nThere were no instances of inconsistent statements that damaged his credibility, \nexcept for his failure to disclose his student loans on his SCA. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n18-02181 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 19, 2019); ISCR Case No. 14-02567 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 5, \n2015); ISCR Case No. 10-09035 at 6-7 (App. Bd. June 10, 2014). He explained why he \ndid not disclose this negative financial information. I find Applicant\u2019s denial of intent to \ndeceive the Government about his debts to be credible. Personal conduct trustworthiness \nconcerns are refuted. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n12 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant access to a \npublic trust position and access to sensitive information \u201cmust be an overall \ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines\u201d and the \nwhole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines E and F are incorporated in my \nwhole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those \nguidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old health service information technology specialist \nemployed by the same defense contractor since December 2018. In 2013, he received \nan associate\u2019s degree in business administration. In April 2019, he was divorced. His \nfinances were harmed by his divorce, underemployment, unemployment, and his son\u2019s \nmedical issues. Although he had financial problems, he acted responsibly by bringing his \nmortgage current. There is a mechanism for bringing his student loans to current status, \nthat is, the \u201cincome-driven repayment plan.\u201d It would take 20 years, but he would be able \nto responsibly resolve his student loans. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant \nrefuted the trustworthiness concerns under Guideline E, and he mitigated the \ntrustworthiness concerns under Guideline F. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n13 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for a public trust position is granted. \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n14 \n",

The total amount of the past-due indebtedness was approximately \n$78,118 as of the date of the SOR. Applicant admitted all three allegations in the SOR \nwith explanations. The existence and amount of indebtedness is supported by credit \nreports in the record dated May 18, 2018; February 19, 2020; and February 28, 2021. \n(Government Exhibits 4, 3, and 2.) \n2 \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues had their genesis in the year 2016. Applicant and his \nwife divorced in October of that year. His ex-wife and children live in the United States in \nthe family home. The divorce decree is found at Applicant Exhibit A on pages 6 through \n26. The divorce resulted in continuing child support payments that Applicant was \nobligated to meet. In addition, there were other expenses connected to his children and \nhis ex-wife that he has continued to cover to the present.

At the time he \nretired in June 2016 he was stationed in a foreign country (FC). Applicant elected to stay \nin FC after he retired because he was in a relationship. He had difficulties finding a job \nand was unemployed for several months. Applicant began working with his current \nemployer in December 2016. (Tr. 24.) \nApplicant has been living with a cohabitant in FC since approximately August 2016. \nIn the beginning she would pay the expenses for their living arrangements because she \nmade more money than Applicant. At some point his partner began making less money \nthan he did and Applicant chose to take over paying the majority of expenses for their \nliving arrangement. (Tr. 29-31, 55-57.) \nThe current status of the debts alleged in the SOR is as follows: \n1.a. Applicant admitted owing a mortgage lender approximately $51,842 for a past-\ndue mortgage. Applicant purchased this house in 2013 when he was stationed in the \nUnited States. As stated, Applicant and his wife divorced in 2016. She and Applicant\u2019s \nthree children continue to live in the house, though they hope to move soon. The divorce \ndecree states that Applicant and his wife agreed that he would pay the mortgage on the \nmarital house for three years after the divorce was final in lieu of alimony. Applicant\u2019s \nAnswer and testimony are wrong on this point. At that time the property would be listed \nfor sale if both parties agreed. Until such time as the property was sold Applicant was \nresponsible for the mortgage. Applicant was not able to fulfill the terms of this agreement. \nHe stopped paying the mortgage in 2018. As of the date of the most recent credit report \nin the record, February 28, 2021, the delinquency had risen to $88,735. The mortgage \ncompany had also started foreclosure proceedings. Applicant has not made any recent \npayments on this debt, and has no plans to make payments on this debt. It is not resolved. \n(Government Exhibit 2 at 3; Applicant Exhibit A at 12, 18-20; Tr. 25-29, 31-38.) \n \n \n1.b. Applicant admitted owing approximately $18,969 for a delinquent credit card. \nApplicant used this card to pay bills immediately after he left the Marine Corps. Applicant \nhas not made any recent payments on this debt and has no plans to make payments on \nthis debt. It is not resolved. (Government Exhibit 2 at 4; Tr. 40. 44-47.) \n \n \n1.c. Applicant admitted owing approximately $7,307 for a separate delinquent \ncredit card. The most recent credit report in the record indicates that Applicant appears \nto have two accounts with this bank. One, account number 44171219, has a charged-off \nbalance of $7,307. The second, account number 42668415, is not past due, but is being \npaid under a partial payment arrangement.

Based on the state of the record, I cannot find that this debt is being resolved. \n(Answer; Applicant Exhibit A at 28; Tr. 39-44, 51-54.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant was alleged to owe approximately $78,000 in past-due and charged-off \ncommercial debts, including an unpaid mortgage debt, as of the date the SOR was issued. \nThese facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and \nshift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant is an earnest person, who had a successful military career. However, at \nthe present time he is not eligible for a security clearance. His past-due indebtedness is \nlarge, recent, and he has no plans to pay any of it off in the foreseeable future. While \nApplicant\u2019s divorce obviously had an impact on his ability to pay his debts, he did not \nshow that he has acted responsibly to attempt to resolve that situation. The actions, or \ninactions, of his ex-wife are partially to blame with regard to the mortgage. However, \nApplicant continues to make payments to his ex-wife that are not his legal responsibility. \nWhen and if the house sells Applicant may be able to pay his debts. That would not be a \nsufficiently good-faith effort to pay his creditors, even if he had initiated such action. None \nof the stated mitigating conditions have application in this case. This allegation is found \nagainst Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant=s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not successfully \nmitigated the concerns regarding his financial situation. This is particularly true in terms \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof his large, past-due mortgage debt. He has not demonstrated rehabilitation and the \npotential for pressure, coercion, or duress remains undiminished. Overall, the record \nevidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant=s present suitability for national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

The case was assigned to me on March 18, 2021. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 are admitted into evidence. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 27-year-old laborer, employed by a government contractor since \nNovember 2017. He graduated from high school in 2012 and completed some college \ncourses. He served in the U.S. Navy from 2013 to 2015. While on active duty, Applicant \nwas disciplined for falsifying logs in 2015, and reduced in rate. He was honorably \ndischarged. He is unmarried. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline I that Applicant was involuntarily hospitalized in \nJune 2015 based on referral from his Navy command after he showed a noose he created \nto his supervisor with suicidal threats. He was diagnosed with adjustment disorder, \ndependent personality disorder, and borderline personality disorder. The SOR also \nalleges Applicant was evaluated by a psychologist in February 2020, and diagnosed with \nuntreated borderline personality disorder and major depressive disorder, recurrent, \nmoderate. The psychologist noted that Applicant has a history of suicidal ideations and \nself-harm when presented with significant stressors, coupled with a lack of recent \npsychiatric treatment or robust support structure. He opined that Applicant posed a \nsignificant risk to protecting classified information due to his judgment, reliability and \ntrustworthiness. Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. \nApplicant was first referred to a mental health professional on May 8, 2013, for \nscreening after completing a submarine screening questionnaire. The provider noted no \nevidence of a clinically significant disorder of thought, mood, or anxiety based on the \nApplicant\u2019s answers to screening questions, and he was found to be suitable for \nsubmarine duty. Applicant returned to the mental health facility for a follow-up on May 14 \nand June 12, 2015. In June 2015, Applicant was diagnosed with adjustment disorder, \ndependent personality disorder, and borderline personality disorder. He was referred for \nadditional treatment. \nThe DCSA CAF referred Applicant for a psychiatric evaluation on February 7, \n2020. During the evaluation, Applicant described the incident on his submarine with the \nnoose and stated that as a result, he was hospitalized for two to three weeks.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington\nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed\ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3\n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of seeking mental health counseling. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 28. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors;  \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nApplicant attempted to harm himself in 2015, was hospitalized and diagnosed with \nadjustment disorder, dependent personality disorder, and borderline personality disorder. \nHe was again evaluated in 2020 and diagnosed with untreated borderline personality \ndisorder and major depressive disorder, recurrent, moderate. A mental health \nprofessional noted that Applicant\u2019s condition, untreated, may impair his judgment and \nreliability in the protection of classified information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a), (b), and (c) apply. \nThe adjudicative guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns, as set forth in AG \u00b6 29. I reviewed each mitigating condition and found \nnone that fully apply to Applicant\u2019s current situation. He has not taken advantage of \ntreatment since he was hospitalized, and he continued to self-medicate and harm himself \nwhen confronted with stressful situations. Although Applicant is working toward a \nsupervisory position, he has not shown sufficient mitigation to overcome the \nGovernment\u2019s concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge \nmust evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality \nof the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d). The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline I in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to help himself, work attitude, and Navy service. However, he has not \nshown that he has overcome the Guideline I concerns raised in the SOR. \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant or \ncontinue eligibility for access to classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n  Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 provides the security concern arising from drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse stating: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions \nabout a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; and \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance. . . .\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and \n25(c). Additional information is contained in the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant provided some \nimportant mitigating information. He voluntarily disclosed his marijuana possession and \nuse on his SCA, during his OPM interview, and in his SOR response. He has never tested \npositive for use of illegal drugs. He indicated he was willing to abstain from future \nmarijuana possession and use. \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive at this time. In ISCR Case No. \n16-03460 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the applicant had a history of marijuana use, and \nthe Appeal Board said: \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA clearance adjudication is aimed at determining if an applicant has the \nrequisite judgment and reliability to abide by rules designed to protect \nclassified information. . . . [Security concerns arise if] there is doubt as to \nwhether he [or she] will follow the regulatory requirements for handling \nclassified information, which might, in the event, appear burdensome. \nAccess to national secrets entails a fiduciary duty to the U.S. A person who \nenters into such a fiduciary relationship is charged with abiding by legal and \nregulatory guidance regardless of whether he or she believes that guidance \nto be wise. \nPossession of a Schedule I controlled substance is a federal criminal offense. \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained \nin 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance. See Drug \nEnforcement Administration listing at http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/ 21cfr/cfr/1308/ \n1308 11.htm. See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of \nmarijuana on Schedule I). \nIn his March 27, 2019 SCA Applicant said that he occasionally smoked marijuana \nfrom August 2008 to January 2019 in social settings with friends or family. For the second \nhalf of high school and throughout most of his undergraduate studies, he smoked \nmarijuana zero to five times a week. In graduate school, he smoked marijuana about once \nevery two weeks or so. Since leaving graduate school in 2016, he used marijuana once \nevery few months. He said he did not intend to smoke marijuana after January 2019; \nhowever, on April 22, 2019, he told an OPM investigator that he used marijuana in March \n2019. He received marijuana from his stepfather and brother. He did not describe any \ndrug-abuse counseling or treatment. \nAccording to his SOR response, Applicant possessed and used marijuana after he \ncompleted his SCA. \u201cAn applicant who uses marijuana after having been placed on notice \nof its security significance, such as using after having completed a clearance application, \nmay be lacking in the qualities expected of those with access to national secrets.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 17-03191 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 26, 2019) (citing ISCR Case No. 17-04198 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019) (\u201cAn applicant\u2019s misuse of drugs after having been placed on \nnotice of the incompatibility of drug abuse with clearance eligibility raises questions about \nhis or her judgment and reliability)). Applicant has family and friends who use marijuana, \nand it is likely that he will be in the vicinity of marijuana in the future. \nIt is unclear when Applicant most recently used marijuana because there is \ninsufficient evidence to determine whether he possessed or used marijuana in 2020 or \n2021. I cannot rule out his future marijuana use. Guideline H security concerns are not \nmitigated at this time. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline H are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 34-year-old senior user-centered design lead. In 2011, he was \nawarded a bachelor\u2019s degree, and in 2016, he was awarded a doctorate degree. He has \nnever held a security clearance. \nApplicant disclosed his marijuana possession and use on his SCA, during his OPM \ninterview, and on his SOR response. An honest and candid self-report of drug abuse is \nan important indication that, if granted security clearance eligibility, the individual would \ndisclose any threats to national security, even if the disclosure involves an issue that \nmight damage his or her own career or personal reputation. However, the mitigating \nweight of Applicant\u2019s disclosures is undermined by his marijuana possession and use \nbeginning in 2008 and continuing after he completed his SCA, and as recently as March \n2019. Applicant was not specifically asked in the FORM to indicate whether he possessed \nor used marijuana in 2020 or 2021, and he did not volunteer information about his \nmarijuana involvement in 2020 or 2021. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person.

After a thorough review of all the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant, 41, has been working for federal contractors since 2003, and for his current employer and clearance sponsor since March 2016. He was granted clearance eligibility up to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) by another Federal agency (Agency) in about 2005. He married in 2008, and has one son, age eight. He graduated from high school with a large number of college courses completed, and attended college for some time, but never completed his bachelor\u2019s degree. Applicant has done well in his area of expertise. He has established a strong reputation and is respected by peers and employers for his acumen, dedication, leadership, and professionalism.

Applicant admitted all of the SOR \nallegations with comments in mitigation. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR admissions and those at his hearing are incorporated into my \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of all the record evidence, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact: \nApplicant, 41, has been working for federal contractors since 2003, and for his \ncurrent employer and clearance sponsor since March 2016. He was granted clearance \neligibility up to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) by another Federal agency \n(Agency) in about 2005. He married in 2008, and has one son, age eight. He graduated \nfrom high school with a large number of college courses completed, and attended \ncollege for some time, but never completed his bachelor\u2019s degree. \nApplicant has done well in his area of expertise. He has established a strong \nreputation and is respected by peers and employers for his acumen, dedication, \nleadership, and professionalism. His performance evaluations show he has been \nconsistently rated as an exceptional employee who exceeds expectations, and has \nearned yearly awards recognizing him as the best among peers. (AE A and B) \nIn 2013, Applicant participated in several polygraph assisted interviews. (GEs 3 \u2013 \n8, and 10, 11) He disclosed that in mid-2011, he began downloading, storing, and \nviewing child pornography on his personal computer once every two weeks. He viewed \nvideos depicting females ranging from 8 to 17 years of age exposing their genitals, \nmasturbating, and having sexual contact with each other and adults. He masturbated \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nduring these sessions. He also reported that in 2012, he had thought about amassing \nenough classified information to give to Russia or the Ukraine in exchange for a harem \nof little girls. He denied ever acting on it. (Tr. 55) \nApplicant claimed that he stopped viewing child pornography in about October \n2012 after discussing his behavior in detail with his wife and promising her that he \nwould stop. He had his wife set the passwords of his home computer to prevent him \nfrom searching for child pornography. At his hearing, he admitted that he was able to go \naround the passwords and use the computers. He attributed his child pornography \nviewing habits to the death of a close female friend in 2009. \nDuring a May 2014 polygraph assisted interview, Applicant described himself as \na pedophile because he is sexually attracted to underage girls. He claimed he has \nnever acted on his desires. Between the spring of 2013 and March 2014, Applicant read \nerotic stories featuring underage females engaging in sexual acts with adults. He \nclaimed he stopped reading these stories in March 2014, because they made his sexual \nurges stronger. He stated that he was masturbating once per month to the thought of \nengaging in sexual acts with underage females. He told his interviewers that having and \nmaintaining a clearance was a strong deterrent to keep him from viewing child \npornography. \nAfter the interview, Applicant participated in counseling with his own therapist \nand an Agency therapist. After a psychological evaluation, the Agency therapist \ndiagnosed Applicant with Pedophilic Disorder. Notwithstanding this diagnosis, the \nAgency therapist recommended Applicant continue his work. During a following \ninterview in August 2015, Applicant disclosed that he had searched for, downloaded, \nstored on his computer, and viewed child pornography on six to seven occasions from \none month after his Agency\u2019s psychological evaluation in June 2014, to most recently in \nJune 2015. He also used his cell phone to search for child pornography. After the \ninterview, the Agency suspended his clearance and SCI eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s appeal to the Agency\u2019s decision included a psychological evaluation \nin December 2015, performed by his treating psychologist, Dr. C, a licensed \npsychologist (Psy.D). He was diagnosed with: 1) Pedophilic Disorder, Nonexclusive \nType, Sexually Attracted to Females (so the attraction to underage females will always \nbe present); 2) Bipolar Disorder, Most Recent Episode Depressed, Mild; and 3) Alcohol \nDependence in Sustained Full Remission. Based on the evaluation report, it appears \nthat the psychologist believed that Applicant had only sought and viewed child \npornography between 2011 and 2012, with a one-time relapse in 2015. (GE 4) \nApplicant\u2019s evidence fails to establish that Dr. C was aware that between the \nspring of 2013 and March 2014, he read erotic stories featuring underage females \nengaging in sexual acts with adults. It is also not clear whether Dr. C knew that between \nJune 2014 (one month after his Agency\u2019s psychological evaluation) and June 2015, he \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nviewed child pornography on six to seven occasions, and not just one time. (GE 10) The \nAgency revoked Applicant\u2019s clearance in February 2016. (GE 6) \nAfter submitting his 2017 SCA, Applicant was interviewed by investigators from \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in July, September, and November 2017, \nand answered a set of interrogatories from the DOHA, in about May 2020. (GE 2). In \nsubstance, Applicant reiterated his prior statements to Agency investigators during his \ninterviews with OPM investigators. \nIn January 2020, the CAF referred Applicant for a psychological evaluation, \nwhich was performed by Dr. W, a licensed Doctor of Clinical Psychology (Psy.D). The \nevaluation report was completed in February 2020. (GE 13) During the evaluation, \nApplicant told Dr. W that the last time he viewed child pornography was in 2018. She \nnoted that via a post-interview email, Applicant re-stated that he last viewed child \npornography in late 2017, towards the end of his therapy sessions with Dr. C. \nApplicant\u2019s counseling records show that he ended his therapy with Dr. C in November \n2018. (GE 12) During the evaluation process, Dr. W spoke with Dr. C. Dr. W noted that \nDr. C believed Applicant last viewed child pornography in 2013, with a relapse in 2015. \n(See AE G; GE 13) Applicant\u2019s counseling records reflect that he told Dr. C he \n\u201crelapsed\u201d once in 2016. \nDr. W diagnosed Applicant as follows: (GE 13) \n296.56 Bipolar I Disorder, most recent episode depressed, in full remission \nF65.4 Pedophilic Disorder (Nonexclusive type, sexually attracted to females) \nIn her opinion, Applicant\u2019s symptoms of Bipolar Disorder appear to be well \ncontrolled by his adherence to psychiatric medications. Concerning Applicant\u2019s \nPedophilic Disorder, she stated: [Applicant] presents with a condition (Pedophilic \nDisorder) that could pose a significant risk to his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness \nconcerning classified information. In her opinion, Applicant\u2019s prognosis is questionable. \nAt his hearing, Applicant presented his own psychological evaluation performed \nby Dr. C, in March 2001. (AE G) Dr. C diagnosed Applicant with: \nF31.31 Bipolar Disorder, most recent episode depressed, mild \nF65.4 Pedophilic Disorder (Nonexclusive type, sexually attracted to females)  \nDr. C\u2019s evaluation is favorable to Applicant. She noted that he denied acting on \nhis fantasies by sexually assaulting children, and that he consistently expressed severe \nemotional distress related to his unwanted sexual fantasies. She highlighted that he \nouted himself as a consumer of child pornography to family members and some friends, \nand that he has received \u201coverwhelming support\u201d from them in his efforts towards \nabstinence and controlling his sexual urges. Dr. C believes that during his course of \ntherapy, Applicant abstained from viewing child pornography entirely with the exception \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nof a relapse that occurred in June 2015. Dr. C failed to note Applicant\u2019s relapse of \nFebruary 2016, which was documented in her counseling notes. (GE 12) \nApplicant admitted that he engaged in downloading and viewing child \npornography from approximately 2011 to 2018. He stated that his last viewing of child \npornography occurred shortly before he stopped his treatment with Dr. C in November \n2018. (GE 12; SOR answer; Tr. 26) Applicant stated that if his counseling records do \nnot state the times he relapsed it was likely an oversight that he does not understand, \nand volunteer to bring the information to Dr. C and have her amend her evaluation \nletter. (Tr. 92) \nBased on Applicant\u2019s treatment records and Dr. C\u2019s March 2021 evaluation, it \nappears she was unaware of Applicant\u2019s relapses after February 2016. At his hearing, \nwhen questioned about how frequently he viewed child pornography after 2015, and \nwhen was the last time he did so, Applicant was evasive, and stated that it has been so \nlong ago he no longer recalls. He admitted that he relapsed more than once during his \ntreatment between 2014 and 2018. (Tr. 38) \nIn his response to DOHA interrogatories (GE 2) and at his hearing, Applicant \nstated that he had been reading erotic textual stories involving children. He claimed that \nreading these erotic stories helps prevent him from engaging in any illegal activity \n(searching, downloading, and viewing child pornography). He testified that reading such \nstories became part of his coping mechanism and therapy. It was his way of addressing \nthat aspect of sexuality in a way that was both legal and ethical. He believes such \nbehavior is legal and ethical. (Tr. 27) \nThere is no information in his counseling records or in Dr. C\u2019s evaluations \nshowing that she was aware he was reading erotic textual stories involving children. I \nnote that he told Agency investigators that in 2013-2014 he had to stop reading erotic \nstories involving young girls engaging in sexual acts because such stories make his \nsexual urges stronger. (GE 8; Tr. 103-104) \nApplicant testified that after his treatment discharge in November 2018, he has \nnot felt the urge to look at child pornography. (Tr. 50) He claimed that viewing child \npornography is behind him, and that he has had no relapses since November 2018. (Tr. \n52) \nAttached to his SOR answer, Applicant included favorable reference statements \nfrom his wife, mother, father, two co-workers, and a supervisor. (AE E) Most of the \nletters were apparently prepared for his appeal of the Agency\u2019s clearance revocation in \n2015-2016. Only one letter was dated in 2019; only one writer indicated he believed \nApplicant\u2019s clearance was revoked as a result of a \u201cself-reported violation of his security \nagreement.\u201d None of the references stated their knowledge about the child pornography \nallegations against Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant presented three favorable reference letters, recently \ndated, from friends and a colleague.

It is not clear whether she is aware of the pending \nSOR allegations or the totality of Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January \n2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence.

Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nApplicant was diagnosed with a \u201cPedophilic Disorder, Nonexclusive Type, \nSexually Attracted to Females\u201d three times: in 2014 by an Agency psychologist (GE 4; \nThe evaluation report is not included in the evidence, but Applicant commented on the \ndiagnosis.); in 2018 (AE D) and 2021 (AE G), by Applicant\u2019s treating psychologist, Dr. \nC; and in 2020 by a CAF retained psychologist, Dr. W. (GE 13) \nDr. C\u2019s evaluations are generally favorable to Applicant. She believed that at the \ntime of his discharge, he \u201cpresented with good insight and judgment,\u201d and therapy was \nno longer necessary. She lauded Applicant for maintaining his abstinence from viewing \nchild pornography entirely during his course of therapy, with the exception of a relapse \nin June 2015. She also commended him for voluntarily disclosing his sexual proclivities \nto family and some friends, and about the support he received from family and friends in \nhis efforts towards abstinence and controlling his sexual urges. She also commended \nhim for doing well after his discharge in 2018.  \nDr. W, on the other hand, concluded that Applicant \u201cpresents with a condition \n(Pedophilic Disorder) that could pose a significant risk to his judgment, reliability or \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntrustworthiness concerning classified information.

Dr. C may also be less objective than Dr. W as she was his treating \npsychologist, and Dr. W was employed by the government to provide an objective \ndiagnosis and prognosis. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a) and (b) are applicable in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; and \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. \nConditions that could mitigate the psychological conditions security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 29. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual 's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nThe mitigating weight of Dr. C\u2019s psychological evaluation is reduced because \nApplicant was not candid with her when he failed to disclose the full extent of his \ncriminal sexual behavior. He only discussed with Dr. C one relapse after 2015 that \noccurred in February 2016 (GE 12). He admitted he relapsed several times between \n2015 and 2018, the last relapse occurring shortly before he was discharged from \ntreatment in November 2018. Applicant also never told his psychologist of his practice \nof reading erotic textual stories involving children. There is no information in his therapy \nrecords or in Dr. C\u2019s evaluations showing that she was aware of his practice of reading \nerotic textual stories involving children. His reading of such stories may have increased \nhis desire for a sexual relationship with a child or to return to viewing child pornography.   \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, I find that none of the above mitigating \nconditions are established. He failed to mitigate the psychological conditions security \nconcerns. \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nAG \u00b6 12 sets forth the security concern as follows: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nApplicant was diagnosed with Pedophilic Disorder. He has deliberately searched \nfor, downloaded, stored on his computers, and viewed child pornography multiple times \nbetween 2011 and at least 2017. He feels shame and anxiety associated with his child \npornography sexual predilections and he does not want his sexual behavior to be \ndiscovered by others. He knew possession of child pornography was wrong, and he did \nit anyway. \nAG \u00b6 13 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature; whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nApplicant deliberately viewed and possessed child pornography many times \nbetween 2011 and until at least 2017. The sexual behavior of a criminal nature is \nestablished by the record evidence. He engaged in a pattern of compulsive, self-\ndestructive, or high-risk sexual behavior that he was unable to stop, and it causes him \nto be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a) and (c) are applicable \nto this case. AG \u00b6 13(b) is not established because he is able to stop viewing and \npossessing child pornography; however, there is a lingering concern that he may \nchoose to resume possession of child pornography because of his strong sexual \nattraction to children. \nApplicant has been trying to stop his criminal behavior. He sought counseling \nand therapy to control his depression, anxiety, and his child pornography addiction. \nAccording to Dr. C, Applicant is progressing with his counseling and therapy. \nAG \u00b6 14 provides the following possible mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of similar nature; \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nAG \u00b6 14(a) is not raised by the evidence and it is not applicable. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14(b) is not applicable because Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior of concern is \nrecent and it occurred frequently. It is not clear from the evidence submitted whether \nApplicant will refrain from possessing child pornography in the future. I find that his \ncriminal sexual behavior is likely to recur, and it does cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. \nAG \u00b6 14(c) is not applicable because Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior continues to be \na basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6 14(d) is not applicable. The children he viewed engaging in sexual behavior \nare too young to consent to his viewing of their pictures. Moreover, many of the \nchildren were likely coerced into engaging in the sexual conduct. \nFor the same reasons discussed under the Guideline I mitigating conditions, \nincorporated herein, AG \u00b6 14(e) is applicable, but does not mitigate the security \nconcerns. Guideline D security concerns are not mitigated. \nThe SOR \u00b6 2.b. alleged and Applicant admitted that he currently reads erotic \ntextual stories involving children. The Government failed to establish that such behavior \nis a criminal offense under Federal or state law. As a general principle, the First \nAmendment bars the government from dictating what we see, read, or speak. Although \nfreedom of speech has its limits; it does not embrace certain categories of speech, \nincluding defamation, incitement, obscenity, and pornography produced with real \nchildren.\u201d Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234, 246-47 (2002). I find this \nallegation for Applicant. \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR cross-alleged the same sexual behavior alleged \nunder Guideline D. For the sake of brevity, the findings of fact, analysis, and \nconclusions discussed under Guideline D are hereby incorporated in my Guideline E \nanalysis. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 sets forth the security concern as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during a national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative process . . . . \nApplicant was diagnosed with Pedophilic Disorder. He engaged in sexual \nbehavior of a compulsive nature. He sought, downloaded, stored, and viewed child \npornography multiple times between 2011 and at least 2017. He feels significant shame \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand anxiety associated with his child pornography sexual predilection; and does not \nwant his sexual behavior to be discovered by others. Applicant\u2019s behavior raises the \nfollowing disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 16: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such \nconduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . .. \nThe record establishes AG \u00b6 16(e)(1), requiring additional inquiry about the \npossible applicability of the mitigating conditions. I considered the following mitigating \ncondition set forth by AG \u00b6 17 as partially raised by the evidence: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not applicable. Possession of child pornography is a serious \noffense. It is illegal under federal law (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252) to produce, distribute, receive \nor possess any child pornography. When one knowingly views an image of child \npornography on a computer, one is criminally culpable for possession of the image, \neven if it is deleted without saving it on the computer. A person who is convicted of \nknowingly possessing child pornography can be sentenced up to 10 years in prison or \nup to 20 years in prison if the minor depicted in the image is under the age of twelve. \nFor the same reasons discussed above in the discussion of Guidelines I and D \nmitigating conditions, incorporated herein, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) and (e) are partially \napplicable, but do not fully mitigate the security concerns. Personal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines D \nand E in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under those \nguidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant, 41, has been working for federal contractors since 2003, and for his \ncurrent employer and clearance sponsor since around March 2016. He was granted \nclearance eligibility with SCI access in 2005. \nApplicant\u2019s references attested to his professionalism, skills, knowledge, \nleadership, and noted that he is considered an exceptional employee. I considered that \nApplicant sought mental health treatment starting in 2014, and continued his treatment \nto November 2018, improving his condition. Notwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s evidence is \ninsufficient to mitigate the security concerns. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated psychological conditions, sexual \nbehavior, and personal conduct security concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a \nsecurity clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this time. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the \nDirective, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole \nperson. Psychological conditions, sexual behavior, and personal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

The debts \nare comprised of collections accounts and charged-off accounts (auto repossession, \ncredit card, consumer debt, and medical debts). The debts are established by credit \nreports from January 2021 (incorrectly dated in the FORM as January 15, 2020), October \n2019, and July 2018, and his SOR admissions. (Items 2, 4-6) \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to bearing the financial responsibility for \nsupporting his infirm mother and before he passed away, his stepfather. He also had his \nown medical conditions, which were not fully covered by his medical plan, and periods of \nunemployment. He disputed information on the credit reports without providing \ndocumentation supporting the disputes. He also pointed out that he has paid several \naccounts not listed on the various credit reports. He also described some of the various \ncharitable and civic organizations he has worked with in the past. (Item 2; AE A) \nThe status of the SOR debts is as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a-$10,290 charge off. This is an auto repossession account opened in \nJune 2014. Applicant admitted having an auto voluntarily repossessed in 2014, but \nclaimed that he did not have any knowledge of this creditor. He claimed his dealings were \nwith the creditor listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He did not provide any documentation supporting \nhis dispute or documents that show this account is a duplicate of the debt listed in SOR \n\u00b6 1.d. This debt is unresolved.

It was assigned \nto this creditor in March 2015. It reflects a first delinquency of July 2014 and remains \nunpaid. This debt is unresolved. (Items 2, 4-6; AE A) \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e)-$5,479 charge off. This is an account with a financial institution \nopened in April 2014, which went delinquent in 2015.

Applicant admitted this account and has \nexpressed his intent not to pay the account, but let it \u201cfall off my credit.\u201d This debt is \nunresolved. (Items 2, 4-6; AE A) \n(SOR \u00b6 1.g)-$1,120 collection. This is a medical debt assigned in September \n2017, which went delinquent in June 2017. Applicant claimed he was disputing this debt \nbased upon an alleged Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) \nviolation. He failed to produce documentation to support his dispute. This debt is \nunresolved. (Note: The payment of $1,120 reflected in AE A, may be toward this debt, \nhowever, Applicant fails to identify it as such and no other evidence in the record connects \nthe SOR debt with this payment. Even if I considered the payment identified in AE A as \npaying this debt and finding for Applicant on this allegation, it would not change the overall \nresult).

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has approximately $40,000 of delinquent debt, some of which relates \nback to 2014. With the exception of recently paying three of the smaller debts, the larger \ndebts remain unaddressed by him. He stated that he did not intend to pay the larger debts, \nbut rather he would let them fall off his credit report due to the passage of time. I find the \nabove disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nApplicant has a long history of financial difficulties. The SOR debts are recent and \nall but three small debts remain unresolved. He did not provide sufficient evidence to \nshow that his financial problems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. While \nApplicant dealt with financial conditions beyond his control (supporting his parents, his \nperiods of unemployment, and his own medical issues), I find he has not acted \nresponsibly in trying to resolve his debts. He has chosen to allow the passage of time to \nremedy his bad credit reports. While this method may clean up his credit, it fails to \nadvance his security worthiness. His efforts to resolve three small SOR debts and another \nnon-SOR debt are commendable but insufficient to conclude that his overall financial \nproblems are being resolved or are under control. Likewise, he has failed to establish a \ngood-faith effort to resolve his remaining delinquent debts. There is no evidence Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nused a financial counselor.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, including his financial support for his \nparents, his periods of unemployment, his own medical issues, and his charitable and \ncivic contributions. Nevertheless, Applicant has not established a track record of financial \nstability. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h; 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i - 1.k: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 55, has worked for her employer, a federal contracting company, since April 2018. She was previously granted access to classified information in approximately 1991, but it is unclear if she has held a clearance continuously since then. Applicant completed her most recent security clearance application in June 2017 and did not disclose any derogatory information. A July 2017 credit report showed only one delinquent debt for a time-share property. The other accounts reported were in good standing. A later credit report, dated August 2019, showed that Applicant owed $49,875 on five delinquent accounts, which are alleged in the SOR. (GE 3, GE 5 - 6) At the time Applicant completed the June 2017 security clearance application, she was employed by another federal contracting company where she worked for the previous two years. In November 2017, she learned that her employer did not win the bid to renew the contract on which she had been working. Concerned about the potential loss of employment, Applicant began looking for ways to reduce her high\u00ad interest-rate consumer-credit accounts. At the time, all of her consumer-credit accounts and her mortgage were current. She did not have a history of delinquent debt. Although she described her finances as stable, she began talking to a law firm that specialized in debt-repayment assistance. (GE 2-3; AE A) Applicant was laid off on February 28, 2018. The next day, she retained a law firm to help her negotiate pa",

The delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR are not \nevidence of a history of financial problems, but a short-term strategic default advised by \nApplicant\u2019s legal counsel in the execution of a debt-repayment plan. Since March 2018, \nApplicant has complied with the terms of the repayment plan negotiated by her lawyers, \npaying over $8,000 toward her delinquent accounts. Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 18, 2020, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the financial considerations guideline. This action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position, implemented on June 8, 2017. DOD adjudicators were unable \nto find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR, admitted all of the allegations, and requested a \ndecision without a hearing. (Government Exhibit (GE) 2.) The Government submitted its \nwritten case on December 18, 2020. The Government provided Applicant a complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM) and the Directive. She acknowledged \nreceipt of the documents on February 5, 2021. She responded, attaching additional \ninformation regarding the alleged debts. The attachments to the FORM are admitted to \nthe record as GE 1 through 6. Applicant\u2019s FORM response and attachments are \nadmitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through F. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 55, has worked for her employer, a federal contracting company, since \nApril 2018. She was previously granted access to classified information in \napproximately 1991, but it is unclear if she has held a clearance continuously since \nthen. Applicant completed her most recent security clearance application in June 2017 \nand did not disclose any derogatory information. A July 2017 credit report showed only \none delinquent debt for a time-share property. The other accounts reported were in \ngood standing. A later credit report, dated August 2019, showed that Applicant owed \n$49,875 on five delinquent accounts, which are alleged in the SOR. (GE 3, GE 5 - 6) \nAt the time Applicant completed the June 2017 security clearance application, \nshe was employed by another federal contracting company where she worked for the \nprevious two years. In November 2017, she learned that her employer did not win the \nbid to renew the contract on which she had been working. Concerned about the \npotential loss of employment, Applicant began looking for ways to reduce her high\u00ad\ninterest-rate consumer-credit accounts. At the time, all of her consumer-credit accounts \nand her mortgage were current. She did not have a history of delinquent debt. Although \nshe described her finances as stable, she began talking to a law firm that specialized in \ndebt-repayment assistance. (GE 2-3; AE A) \nApplicant was laid off on February 28, 2018. The next day, she retained a law \nfirm to help her negotiate payment plans on six accounts, including those alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d. Under the terms of the 36-month agreement with the law firm, \nApplicant agreed to make monthly payments of $329 to the law firm, which then agreed \nto disburse the funds to the creditors, less its retainer. Because the accounts were in \ngood standing when Applicant enrolled in the program, the law firm advised her to \nstrategically default on the accounts to improve the law firm\u2019s negotiating position. \nApplicant has acted in compliance with the terms of this agreement, paying over \n$13,000 to the law firm between March 2018 and February 2021 toward the resolution \nof the accounts in the repayment plan and in fees to the law firm. (GE 2, 5; AE A) \nTo date, the law firm has helped Applicant achieve favorable results on the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d. The creditor holding the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \n($5,964) and 1.b ($4,769) filed a civil action against Applicant to obtain a judgment on \nboth accounts. The law firm entered consent judgments on Applicant\u2019s behalf in \nDecember 2018 and in May 2019 for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, respectively. Under the terms \nof each order, Applicant has agreed to make monthly payments on each account over \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe next four years.

The terms of the consent order are set to continue after Applicant\u2019s contract \nwith the law firm ended in March 2021. Beginning in April 2021, Applicant will make the \nmonthly payments directly to the creditor. She resolved SOR \u00b61.c ($2,368) in August \n2020, as she promised in her answer to the SOR. She also included in her SOR answer \nthe payment receipt for SOR \u00b6 1.d ($588). (GE 2; AE A, C, E -F) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($36,204) is for a time-share property Applicant \nowed jointly with her husband, who was the primary debtor. The couple purchased the \nproperty in 2014. Believing that the creditor engaged in fraudulent practices to originate \nthe loan, the couple refused to continue making payments on the obligation in January \n2015. The creditor cancelled the debt and issued an IRS Form 1099-C for the 2015 tax \nyear. (GE 2; AE G) \nApplicant describes her current finances as steady. She reports that all of her \nconsumer-credit accounts and her mortgage are in good standing. She has not opened \nany new consumer-credit accounts. The credit reports in the record show that until \nMarch 2018, she had a long and favorable credit history. (GE 5 \u2013 6; AE A, D) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nadministrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 \ndescribing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nUnresolved delinquent debt is a serious security concern because failure to \n\u201csatisfy debts [or] meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18). The SOR alleged and Applicant admitted that she \nowed $49,875 on five delinquent accounts. The record supports a finding that AG \u00b6 \n19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d applies. \nThe Applicant has presented sufficient evidence to mitigate the alleged concerns. \nSpecifically, the following mitigating conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source,  such as a non-\nprofit credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or under control; and, \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has a long and favorable credit history. In anticipation of a foreseeable \nloss of employment due to events beyond her control, Applicant began making a plan \nfor the repayment of her consumer-credit accounts. Immediately after losing her job, \nshe retained a law firm specializing in debt repayment. She has since followed the \nadvice of her counsel and complied with the repayment terms the law firm negotiated on \nher behalf. \nTo date, Applicant has resolved or is resolving each of the SOR debts. She has \npaid over $8,000 toward her outstanding debts, complying with the consent orders of \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and settling the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nand 1.d. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e has been cancelled by the creditor. Applicant\u2019s \nactions are not an indication of financial irresponsibility, but actions taken in accordance \nto a strategic debt repayment plan. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are under control. \nBased on the record, Applicant has mitigated the concerns raised in the SOR by \nher financial problems. She has established that she is a suitable candidate for access \nto classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). An applicant is not required to be debt free. She must \nestablish that she has a plan for resolving her delinquent debt and demonstrate that she \nhas acted in accordance to that plan. Applicant has done so. She demonstrated a \nproactive approach toward her finances, securing professional help before she \nexperienced financial problems. She does not have a history of financial problems; she \nincurred delinquent debt for a short period for a specific purpose as advised by her \nattorneys. She has demonstrated a favorable and consistent history of debt repayment. \nHer current credit reports show no indications of ongoing problems. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nBased on the record, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance.

(Item 2)  \nApplicant\u2019s finances  \nBetween December 2017 and 2020, Applicant accumulated five delinquent debts \nexceeding $33,000. (Items 1-7) She has a considerable history of financial difficulties \nthat led to the revocation off her security clearance in 2003 before her clearance was \nreinstated in 2008. (Items 2-3) Since her clearance reinstatement in 2008, she has \naccrued additional debts without documented efforts to resolve them to date.

Neither the credit \nreport nor Applicant furnished documented information of the circumstances that \nproduced the closure of these accounts, and their disposition cannot be the subject of \nspeculation.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. The AG guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                 \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n        Financial Considerations \n \n          The Concern: Failure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated by, \nand thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personal \nsecurity concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is  \nalso a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage.

The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro.

See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd.

On the strength of the evidence presented, two disqualifying \nconditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines (DCs) for financial considerations apply to \nApplicant\u2019s situation: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e) require no independent \nproof to substantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3. 1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \n\u00a7 262 (6th ed. 2006). Her admitted debt delinquencies are fully documented and create \njudgment issues as well over the management of her finances. See ISCR Case No. 03\u00ad\n01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004) \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified and sensitive \ninformation is required to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security \nclearance that entitles the person to access classified and sensitive information. While \nthe principal concern of a security clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties \nis vulnerability to coercion to classified information or to holding sensitive position, \njudgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt delinquencies. \nHistorically, the timing and resolving of debt delinquencies are critical to an \nassessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability and good judgment in following \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nrules, regulations, and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified ad \nsensitive information or to holding a sensitive position.

Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties associated with her accumulated student loan \nand consumer debts raise considerable concerns over his ability to manage her \nfinances in a responsible and reliable way. \nExtenuating circumstances associated with Applicant\u2019s undetailed chronic \nmedical issues reportedly played some contributing role in Applicant\u2019s accumulation of \nher delinquent accounts. Her reported medical circumstances warrant some extenuating \ncredit. Mitigating Condition (MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial \nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances,\u201d partially applies to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nBecause Applicant has failed to address any of her accumulated delinquent \naccounts with the income resources available to her, the second prong of MC 20(b), \n\u201cand the individual acted responsibly,\u201d is not available to her at this time. With so little \nfinancial information to work with relative to the circumstances prompting her to fall \nbehind with her student loan and consumer accounts covered by the SOR, no \nmeaningful extenuation credit can be assigned to her at this time. \nAfforded opportunities to provide clarification of her current financial condition \nand explanations of her lack of payment progress on her delinquent debts, Applicant \nprovided no persuasive clarifications or explanations for (a) how she allowed her debts \nto become delinquent with her past and current income available to her and (b) why she \nhas failed to take any documented steps to date to address her listed delinquent \naccounts. Account histories of Applicant\u2019s listed SOR debts are not sufficiently \ndeveloped in this administrative record to permit more detailed assessments of the \nmanaging of her finances during the critical years in issue. \nFor lack of any documented repayment or financial counseling initiatives by \nApplicant, other potentially available mitigating conditions cannot be applied to her \nsituation. Based on her failure to date to establish a meaningful track record of \naddressing her delinquent accounts, it is too soon to make safe predictive assessments \nas to whether she can restore her finances to stable levels consistent with minimum \nrequirements for holding a security clearance. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether Applicant\u2019s failure to adequately address her delinquent debts \nare otherwise compatible with DoD requirements for holding a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s credited contributions to the defense industry are not enough at this time to \novercome her accumulated delinquent debts and her lack of a meaningful track record \nfor dealing with them and maintaining responsible control of her finances.

Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. Applicant initially responded to \nthe SOR and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn February 23, 2021, at the request of Applicant, the case was converted to a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Applicant answered the SOR and the case was \nassigned to me on April 7, 2021.

Applicant submitted Exhibits (AE) A through J. \nApplicant testified in his own behalf and presented one telephonic witness, qualified as \nan expert. I held the record open until June 10, 2021, and Applicant submitted ten \nexhibits (AE) K-T, which were admitted into the record. Based on my review of the \ndocumentary evidence, I find that Applicant has not mitigated financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nFindings of Fact \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all allegations with explanations. \n(Item 3) He is 46 years old. Applicant is married and has two children. After graduation \nfrom high school in 1993, Applicant attended college, and he obtained his \nundergraduate degree in 1998. Applicant completed his most recent security clearance \napplication in May 2019. He has worked for his current employer as a technical analyst \nsince June 2009. (GE 1, Tr. 21) Applicant holds a security clearance. \nFinancial \n \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent debts, including three past-due mortgage \naccounts, a past-due auto loan and credit card, and federal and state tax debts. The \ndebts alleged total approximately $1,034,454.00 (Item 1, Tr. 14)  Applicant attributes his \nfinancial problems to his wife\u2019s job loss from a contract that ended in 2018, and her \nchange in job status which significantly reduced their income from about $150,000 to \nabout $37,500. (Tr. 25) He claims that before 2018 he maintained excellent credit and \nwas current on all obligations.   \n \n \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.a-a past-due home mortgage account in the amount of $42,653, \nwith a total loan balance of $662,482. This is Applicant\u2019s primary residence, which he \npurchased in 2016. (Tr. 28) Applicant obtained a loan modification from his bank and \nmade payments. After the temporary modification, Applicant completed two temporarily \nreduced payment plans. The lender agreed to a full modification on the loan. The loan is \ncurrent as of August 2020. Applicant submitted a copy of the loan modification \nagreement and a current account statement. (AE J) \n \n \nAs to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.c, Applicant acknowledges that they are past-due mortgage \naccounts for investment properties that he purchased in 2008 and 2009. (Tr. 61). For \nthe property listed in 1.b, Applicant states that property became delinquent at the time of \nhis wife\u2019s job loss in 2018. It also went into foreclosure. (GE 5)  This property was a \nrental property. (Tr. 30) The mortgage is not current and Applicant now wants to sell the \nproperty after he performs minor repairs. He tried to obtain a loan modification, but was \nnot successful. (Tr.32) Applicant\u2019s plan was to have the property listed in two weeks.  \n(AE O) He believes the value of the property is $184,000. (Tr. 33) Due to the pandemic, \nApplicant could not do anything last year to resolve the issue.  \n \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant admits the debt in SOR 1.d for an account that is past due in the\namount of $137, with a car loan balance of $6,500. He provided a statement showing\npayments made of $242 and a loan balance of $6,954. (AE B, Tr. 38) \n \n \n \n \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.e, Applicant admitted that the account was past due in the amount \nof $102, with a total loan balance of $1,485. Applicant provided documentation that as \nof January 2021, the account balance is zero. (AE C, Tr. 43) \n \n \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.f, taxes owed to the Federal Government in the amount of \n$61,968 for tax years 2016 and 2017, Applicant has an installment agreement with the \nIRS. He pays $1,300 a month. The balance is currently $48,755. (Tr. 44, AE F) He also \npresented a payment history. (GE 2) Applicant finished his installment agreement for \nthe 2015 tax year. (Tr.127) \n \n \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.g, taxes owed to the state in the amount of $3,500 for tax year \n2017, Applicant has an installment agreement with the state, which reflects that he is in \ngood standing as of May 6, 2021. He pays $114 a month and the balance is $3,560.  \n(Tr. 46, AE E) However, the first payment is due in June, 2021. (Tr. 69) At the hearing, \nApplicant stated he will pay the entire tax amount with part of his retirement funds. (Tr. \n70) Applicant also had a prior installment agreement with the state.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.c, Applicant admits that the mortgage on the investment property is \npast due in the amount of $1,708, with a total loan balance of about $60,000 not \n$85,677. (Tr. 34) This property has been listed for sale. Applicant is also trying to obtain \na loan modification. (AE D) The property was listed in May, 2021. \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s 2019 subject interview, he affirmed that he owed Federal and state \ntaxes and had installment agreements. (GE2) He also affirmed that he tried to do a \nshort sale for the rental property referenced above. He also stated that he was advised \nnot to pay on the mortgage in order to begin a short sale. His purpose is to get rid of the \nrental properties and focus on his primary residence. (GE 2) Applicant described his \ncurrent financial status as fair. (GE 2) He stated that he is willing and able to repay his \ndebts. (GE 2) He was given the opportunity to provide additional documentation after \nthe interview, but he failed to do so. \nIn February 2021, Applicant obtained the advice of a CPA, who testified by \ntelephone at the hearing. AE R) The witness advised Applicant to begin a monthly \nbudget, sell the rental properties, and sell one of their three vehicles. (AE P) He urged \nApplicant to maintain an emergency fund of three to six months expenses. Applicant \nand CPA will have monthly meetings. (Tr. 57) The CPA believed the plan was feasible \nto resolve Applicant\u2019s financial problems. (Tr. 58) However, he did not advise Applicant \nto withdraw $40,000 from his retirement account. (Tr. 105) \nThe CPA witness is licensed and provides financial counseling, litigation support, \nfinancial analysis and investigations. (Tr. 85) He testified that he has his own business \nand had important positions in the military and the government before his current \nbusiness.

(Tr. 103)  \nA financial statement (AE A) shows liabilities of about $975,000 and a net worth \nof about $249,000. Applicant\u2019s checking account has about $3,000. (Tr. 72) He \nborrowed $40,000 from his $103,000 retirement account recently. (AE S) Applicant is \nnow earning $100,00 a year and his wife is earning $65,000. (Tr.129) He believes he \nhas a net monthly remainder of $1,200. (Tr. 129) At the end of the hearing Applicant, \nstated that he had tax issues as far back as 2012, because his wife had her own \ncompany. (Tr.138) \n. \nApplicant submitted letters of recommendation from two colleagues who both \naffirm that Applicant is a consummate professional and a true expert in his field. He is \nan invaluable and irreplaceable member of the team. (AE H) \nAnother colleague, who has known Applicant for over ten years recommends him \nfor his security clearance. Applicant has never spoken about details of any sensitive \ninformation according to this reference. He is discreet and is an upstanding citizen and \nan active member of his community. The declarant has no doubts about his integrity. \n(AE I) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his record and his credit reports, \nestablish three disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to \nsatisfy debts\u201d),19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) and 19 (g) ( \u201cfailure \nto file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \npay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \ntax authority to pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant admitted the allegations and attributed his current situation to the loss \nof his wife\u2019s employment in 2018. However, he had some tax issues as far back as \n2012. He has two home mortgages on investment properties that are not resolved, \nalthough he has stated his plan to sell the properties. One property is not even on the \nmarket currently. He also has a plan to sell a third vehicle, but it is a plan not a \nresolution at this time. He has been employed earning a good salary despite the loss of \nhis wife\u2019s income. He recently took money ($40,000) from his retirement account to \nbolster his cash flow. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable because in the past, he has not been \nable to pay his bills when due. This situation could recur. \nApplicant did have a circumstance beyond his control in 2018, but he only \nrecently began to address the various financial issues. He had financial issues before \nthat time. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies, but he did not act responsibly under the \ncircumstances. \nApplicant\u2019 did not obtain counseling or financial advice until this year. The CPA \npresented an action plan which Applicant agrees to follow, but the plans are in effect \npromises to pay in the future. Applicant has resolved some debts, and it is not required \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat all debts be paid, but the significant amount of money that he owes puts him in a \nprecarious position. There are not clear indications that the problem is under control at \nthis point in time. AG\u00b6 20 (c) partially applies. \nAG\u00b6 20(d) partially applies. He brought his primary residence home mortgage \nloan to a current status. He paid another account. He does not have a clear track record \nof being consistent with payments. It is impossible to conclude he made sufficient good-\nfaith effort to resolve his debts or that his financial situation is under control. \nAG\u00b6 20(g) applies because Applicant has installment plans with the Federal and \nstate tax authorities to pay his taxes and is in compliance with the arrangements. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has been employed with his current employer since 2009. He recently \nobtained financial counseling this year. He received advice from his CPA, which he \nintends to follow. He is in compliance with his tax installment plans for Federal and state \ntaxes. His wife lost employment in 2018, and that impacted his finances. He has a net \nworth of $249,000. However, he has a significant amount of debt that he has not \nresolved. He has a plan, but it is not yet in place. He has excellent references. He is in a \nplace of rehabilitation, but this is not sufficient for mitigation at this point in time. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with some questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 10, 2020, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 16, 2021. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 7, 2021, and the hearing was convened as \nscheduled on May 14, 2021. The Government offered five exhibits, referred to as \nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 5, which were admitted without objection.

DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on May 27, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 59 years old and married with children. She has a Bachelor\u2019s degree \nin history. She holds the position of Quality Mission Assurance Manager for a defense \ncontractor. She seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment \nin the defense industry. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file Federal and state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018; that she owes the Federal Government \ndelinquent back taxes in the amount of approximately $31,000; that she is delinquent on \na department store credit card debt; and that she is behind on her second mortgage line \nof credit. \nIn her Answer, Applicant admitted allegations 1.a. and 1.c., and denied \nallegations 1.b. and 1.d., and provided explanations. Credit reports of the Applicant \ndated March 6, 2018; August 29, 2019; and February 16, 2021, reflect that each of \nthese debts were at one time owing. (Government Exhibits 3, 4 and 5.) \nApplicant has worked in the defense industry for over forty years, and has held a \nsecurity clearance about that long without incident. She has worked for her current \nemployer since July 1994. During her current employment, she has received a number \nof raises, promotions and accolades. Until 2015, Applicant had always filed her income \ntax returns in a timely fashion. Until 2012, she had always paid her bills and lived within \nher means without struggle or difficulty. \nBeginning in 2012, and extending through 2020, Applicant encountered a series \nof catastrophic events in her personal life that became so overwhelming and \ncomplicated that she lost track of her tax and financial obligations. She accumulated \npiles of paperwork in preparation to file the taxes, but other family matters became the \npriority. She also spent money she could not afford to spend. As a result, Applicant \nbecame indebted to the following creditors: \n1.a. and 1.b. Applicant failed to file her Federal and state income tax returns for a five \nyear period, from 2014 through 2018. As a result, she became indebted to the Federal \nGovernment for delinquent taxes in the amount of approximately $31,000. \n1.c. Applicant became indebted to a bank for an account that was charged off in the \namount of $125,853. \nThis debt is a second line of credit on Applicant\u2019s current \nmortgage. Applicant\u2019s home was in foreclosure proceedings in 2012 and again in 2014. \n1.d. Applicant became delinquent on a department store credit card account in the \napproximate amount of $650 with a total balance of $7,938. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that in 2010 her daughter began to have serious health \nproblems, beginning with paralysis in her limbs, and then brain issues that ultimately \naffected her ability to walk. (Tr. pp. 18-19.) This mystery illness continued for about \neight months. After searching for answers and seeing many doctors for a diagnosis, it \nwas finally determined that Applicant\u2019s daughter suffered from peripheral nerve damage \ndue to West Nile Virus. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit O.) Applicant\u2019s daughter suffered from this \ndisease for over two years. \nShe still experiences its effects. \nThis was not only \ndevastating for the Applicant, but very costly, as well as mentally and emotionally \nexhaustive. \nIn 2014, Applicant underwent knee surgery. In April 2015, an accident at work \ncaused a large catalog case to roll off the back of an incline truck and fall on Applicant\u2019s \nfoot. Applicant suffered a crushing foot injury. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit P.) This caused her \nto be on disability for eight months. Between 2015 and 2017, Applicant had custodial \ncare and full responsibility for her aunt and uncle and their personal affairs. Her aunt \nsuffered from dementia. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit Q.) Since 1998, Applicant had been \nassisting her father, with the care of her mother who suffered from a progressive lung \ndisease requiring multiple hospitalizations. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit R.) \nThese numerous family medical problems \u201cfell on the back\u201d of the Applicant. \nApplicant was responsible to take these family members to their doctor appointments, \nmake decisions regarding their care, and generally be responsible for their well-being,  \nwhile still working full time. These issues are no longer of concern. Applicant\u2019s aunt, \nuncle and mother have now passed away. Her daughter\u2019s health has now greatly \nimproved. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits O, P, Q and R.) \nDuring this same time, Applicant also experienced financial difficulties. \nApplicant\u2019s husband\u2019s business, which had been declining for years, ultimately closed in \n2021. Between 2009 and 2011, Applicant loaned $80,000 to $120,000 to her husband\u2019s \nbrother, which was not paid back as agreed. To support their household income, \nApplicant was forced to borrow money against her 401k, and had to pay the penalties. \nIn 2012 and 2014, Applicant was able to avoid foreclosure proceedings on their home. \n(Tr. pp. 75 and 78.) \nApplicant now realizes that she should never have ignored her tax issues or her \nfinancial problems. Applicant has now filed all of the Federal and state income tax \nreturns for the years in question. \nWhen Applicant filed the income tax returns in \nquestion, her tax liability was adjusted, (since she now filed jointly instead of single), \nand she paid off all tax liabilities associated with those tax years. She no longer owes \nany back taxes to the Federal Government or the state. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B, H, and \nS, and Post-Hearing Exhibit A.) \nRegarding her second mortgage line of credit, Applicant had attempted to make \npayments to the creditor after becoming delinquent but the creditor would not accept \nless than full payment. After many attempts to make a payment, the creditor finally \nagreed to accept payments. Applicant and the creditor have now agreed upon $500 \npayments monthly. \nSince December 2020, Applicant has made regular monthly \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npayments of $500 to the creditor. Applicant plans to continue payments in accordance \nwith the creditor\u2019s wishes until the debt is paid in full. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J, and Tr. pp. \n52-53.) \nIn May 2020, Applicant paid off the balance owed on her department store credit \ncard, and there is no outstanding balance.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L, and Tr. pp. 55-56.) \nApplicant understands that by neglecting her taxes and her finances she made \nher problems worse. Applicant now has a clear picture and understands how important \nher security clearance is, and how she must always be responsible to the Government \nby following strict rules in her personal life to meet the eligibility requirements. \nApplicant also understands that these horrendous life events, no matter how \ndifficult they may become, are never excuses for failing to file her annual Federal and \nstate income tax returns. She further understands that she must always file her income \ntax returns in a timely fashion. Simply filing an extension to file her returns does not \nmean that she is excused from filing. It only means that she has a little more time to file \nher annual income tax returns while still complying with the law. \nPerformance evaluations of the Applicant for the period from 2015 through 2020 \nreflect that Applicant either \u201cmeets\u201d or \u201cexceeds\u201d her job requirements in every category. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit P.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant lived beyond her means and incurred debt she could not afford to pay. \nShe also neglected filing her annual Federal and state income tax filings and incurred \nsignificant tax liability. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved  or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s serious family medical issues were conditions outside of her control. \nHer daughter\u2019s illness, her own injury at work, complicated by her responsibilities to her \naunt and uncle and mother did not help. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems occurred \nbecause of her husband\u2019s business loss, and the fact that Applicant had to borrow from \nher 401k and pay steep penalties in order to maintain the household expenses, and to \navoid foreclosure on their home. \nThese occurrences were also conditions that \nApplicant did not expect to have to deal with. \nDespite these setbacks, Applicant has filed all of the income tax returns in \nquestion and paid all of her back taxes. She has completely resolved her outstanding \ndepartment store credit card debt, and is making regular monthly payments toward \nresolving the debt she incurred on her line of credit.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is a \ncareer employee with a defense contractor. She has performed admirably at work and \nis well respected among her colleagues. She has held a security clearance for about 40 \nyears without incident until these extraordinary life events. Under the particular facts of \nthis case, she has sufficiently addressed the concerns set forth in the SOR. \nApplicant clearly understands the responsibilities of holding a security clearance, \nand that she must always file annual income tax returns according to Federal and state \nlaws. By not filing her income tax returns on time or within the extension period, she \nplaces the onus on the taxing authorities to file for her, which is not their legal \nresponsibility. \nApplicant also understands that being overwhelmed with life\u2019s \nresponsibilities is not an excuse for failing to comply with the tax filing laws. \nFurthermore, Applicant must live within her means, and be able to pay her bills \ncomfortably at all times. If she is unable to do this, she must reduce her expenses, or \nshe will find herself once again in serious trouble with her security clearance. The \nconclusion next time may not be so favorable. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.:  \nFor Applicant \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He is employed as an Engineer II with a \ndefense contractor. He is seeking to retain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment. \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \nApplicant is indebted to the U.S. Department of Education, a private university, \nand several creditors in the approximate amount of $58,317. \nApplicant admits each of \nthe allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline. Credit reports of the Applicant \ndated January 17, 2019; November 1, 2019; and February 5, 2021, confirm this \nindebtedness. (Government Exhibits 4, 5 and 6.) Applicant began working for his \ncurrent employer in 2018. \nApplicant attended a prestigious university and graduated with his Bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2016. Applicant did not have money to attend the university. To afford \ncollege, from the summer of 2010 to 2016, Applicant borrowed at least $60,000 in \nstudent loans to pay for his tuition, living expenses, books, and related expenses. \nApplicant stated that he did not know much about the student loan program. He did \nknow that his father co-signed for him. He did not know that the loan would also be in \nhis name, since the bills are sent to his father\u2019s address. (Tr. p. 26.) Applicant thought \nthat because his father co-signed for the loans, his father would be responsible to pay \nthem. Applicant acknowledged, however, that he knows that his father does not have \nthe money to pay the student loans. \nApplicant states that since graduating from college, he has been unable to afford \nto pay his student loans, until recently. He explains that he had a long episode of \nsickness. In 2013, while at school, Applicant became very ill.  He experienced dizziness \nand high temperatures. \nAfter seeing many different medical specialists, it was \ndetermined that he had a vestibular disorder. Applicant explained this to be a serious \ninfection of the inner ear that has compromised his immune system. Sometimes he has \nhad to stay in bed and forego other responsibilities. This has been very debilitating and \nkept him restricted through 2016. \nIt has continued to impact his health in other \nrespects. Applicant also incurred many very costly expenses related to his illness, such \nas co-pays and prescriptions. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nApplicant further explained that since graduation from college, he has moved \nfrom state to state a number of times. He has kept his parent\u2019s home as his permanent \naddress, but has maintained other temporary addresses. \nWith such, he has not \nreceived his bills or notifications from his creditors about his delinquent debts. He \nstates that he only picks up his mail when he goes to visit his parents out of state, and \nthat is about twice a year. (Tr. p. 76.) Applicant stated that it was not until he received \ncorrespondence from the DoD about his security clearance that he started looking for \nways to pay off his debts. (Tr. p. 78.)  \nSometime in 2019, Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished for his delinquent student \nloans. This garnishment was stopped when the pandemic started and are due to \ncontinue when the pandemic is over. Applicant stated that just last month was the first \ntime he has contacted the student loan office regarding his student loans. He states \nthat they offered to place him in a program to assist him in resolving his excessive \nstudent loan debt. (Tr. p. 32.) Applicant explained that this ten-month program would \nrequire him to make consistent payments every month to be eligible for regular monthly \npayments based upon his income. \nThe following delinquent student loan accounts and three medical bills are \ndelinquent and owing and are of security significance: \n1.a.

He states that he now has a payment arrangement in place to pay \nhis Federal student loan debts, the private university student loan debt, and the Sallie \nMae student loan debt. The debts still remain outstanding. He states that he has not \nyet paid and/or settled his medical debts set forth in 1.l., 1.n., 1.o., and 1.p. Applicant \nstates that he plans to pay all of his delinquent debts as soon as he is capable of doing \nso. (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant took out student loans to attend college that until recently he has not \nbeen concerned about paying. All of his student loan debt remains owing. He claims \nthat he has recently settled several other delinquent debts because he needs a security \nclearance. There is insufficient evidence in the record to conclude that he is financially \nstable, or that he can afford his lifestyle, or that he has financial resources available to \npay his past-due financial obligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nFour Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved  or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nCircumstances beyond the Applicant\u2019s control, namely his extended illness and \nits aftermath, caused him to miss some work, which contributed to his financial \nproblems. But the main reason Applicant has not paid his delinquent debts is because \nthey have not been a priority for him. Since becoming employed, Applicant has sent \nmoney to his parents out of state. He has even sent money to his brother out of the \ncountry. Applicant has known about his delinquent student loan debt and has simply \nignored the debt for many years. It was not until his security clearance became an \nissue that he became concerned about his delinquent debt. Applicant has recently \nsettled a few of his debts, and has set up a payment plan to pay his student loans. Even \nso, Applicant has done too little, too late. He has not demonstrated a pattern of \nresponsible financial behavior showing that he can pay his bills in a timely fashion or \nthat he can meet his financial obligations without difficulty. Under the circumstances, \nApplicant has failed to meet his burden. None of the mitigating conditions set forth \nabove under Guideline F provide full mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is an \nintelligent, educated man, but who shows many areas of immaturity. These areas of \nimmaturity cannot be solved by ignoring his excessive indebtedness. \nApplicant\u2019s \nconduct shows poor judgment and unreliability. He has no pattern or practice of paying \nhis debts in a responsible manner. He has not achieved financial stability at the level \nrequired to access classified information. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a., through 1.h.  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i.  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j. \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k. \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l., through 1.v.  \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Foreign influence \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information or to hold \na sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 19, 2020, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Central \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the financial considerations and foreign influence guidelines the \nDoD could not make the preliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a \nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The \naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960); DoD Directive 5220.6 Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, (January 2, 1992) (Directive); \nand Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 16, 2020, and requested a hearing. This \ncase was assigned to me on October 15, 2020. A hearing was scheduled for December \n8, 2020, and was heard on the scheduled date. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case \nconsisted of five exhibits (GEs 1-5) and a request for administrative notice of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (China). Applicant relied on 21 exhibits (A-U) and one \nwitness (himself). The transcript (Tr.) was received on December 30, 2020. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the proceedings, Applicant asked to leave the record open to \nafford him the opportunity to supplement the record with explanations of his three \ncancellations of debt with SOR creditors 1.b-1.d. For good cause shown, Applicant was \ngranted 14 days to supplement the record. The Government was afforded three days to \nrespond. Within the time permitted, Applicant provided statutory authority that the three \ncancelled debts in issue were barred by Applicant\u2019s  state\u2019s statute of limitations and are \nno longer enforceable. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions were admitted as AEs V-Y \nwithout objections for consideration. Respective comments of counsel for both parties \non the exhibits will also be considered. \nThe Government filed a timely response brief claiming that the state statute of \nlimitation authority cited by Applicant only precludes enforcement of the debts in issue \nand does not address questions of trust associated with Applicant\u2019s lack of any \ndocumented evidence of his addressing the debts in question with payments and \npayment plans.  \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated five delinquent consumer \ndebts exceeding $55,000. Allegedly, Applicant\u2019s debts remain unsatisfied and \nunresolved. \nUnder Guideline B, Applicant allegedly has a girlfriend who is a citizen and \nresident of china. Allegedly, Applicant\u2019s relationship with this girlfriend has not been \nadequately explained and reconciled with U.S. security interests. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the financial considerations \nallegations with explanations and clarifications. Addressing the financial allegations, he \nclaimed the debts in in question have been in Applicant\u2019s records for many years and \nwere charged off in 2017, 2018, and 2016, respectively. He claimed that the debts were \nthe result of his divorce and that he did not understand that charge-offs of the debts \nwould hurt his credit. He also claimed that the charge-offs and tax payments on the \ndebts settled any question about the payments. Applicant further claimed that he has \nparticipated in credit counseling in an effort to resolve his debts. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the foreign influence allegations, he admitted the \nallegations with explanations and clarifications. He claimed he began signing up with \ndating websites while going through his divorce in 2012.

(AE U; Tr. 39-40) Whether the creditor (SOR \u00b6 1.a) holding \nthe second mortgage on the property approved the short sale is unclear. From all of \ninformation supplied in the escrow statement and credit reports, SOR creditor \u00b6 1.a was \nnever asked to approve the short sale and never gave its approval. \nUnder the terms of the May 2020 escrow set up by the title company \nadministering the parties\u2019 combined settlement statement (AE U; Tr. 73-74), the first \nmortgagee received the first $203,925 of the recorded $226,000 sale proceeds. (AE U) \nSOR creditor \u00b6 1.a, in turn, was credited with receipt of the remaining $6,000 of the sale \nproceeds, leaving this creditor with a $20,000 delinquency balance on its mortgage \ndebt. (AE U) The closing escrow statement confirmed that that Applicant\u2019s property was \nsold for $212,000. Because SOR creditor \u00b6 1.a was left with an unsecured shortfall of \nover $20,000 from the sale, it may still have an enforceable deficiency claim against \nApplicant (AE U) However, SOR creditor \u00b6 1.a is of record in crediting Applicant with \npayment in full of the mortgage balance on Applicant\u2019s home equity loan. (AE A) As a \nresult, this SOR debt is resolved favorably to Applicant. \nAs a condition to filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy relief in July 2020, Applicant \ncompleted a credit course with an accredited financial counseling service. (AE O) No \nrepayment plan was prepared for Applicant by credit counseling service, and Applicant \napparently never proceeded with filing for Chapter 11 relief. (AE O) \nApplicant\u2019s online relationship with a Chinese national \nYears after finalizing his 2012 divorce, Applicant established a series of online \nrelationships with Chinese nationals. His first two online relationships were brief, lasting \nno more than a month before he broke them off. (Tr. 59-60) In 2018, he established a \nmore substantial online relationship with a Chinese national who was a citizen and \nresident of China. (GEs 1 and 5) He met this female Chinese national online through a \npaid online dating site. This girlfriend was identified by Applicant as a manager of a \nprivate jewelry store in China. (GE 5) No biographical profile of this Chinese national \nwas provided by Applicant, and very little is known about her in this evidentiary record. \nBetween August 2018 and June 2020, Applicant and this girlfriend maintained a \nclose and virtually daily online contact (through computer chat features) and exchanged \nphotographs of each other. (GE 5; Tr.57-61) Without transcripts or other documented \nevidence of their communications, little can be gleaned from their daily contacts. \nWhether Applicant and his Chinese girlfriend ever became bound by affection, \ninfluence, common interests, or obligation over the course of their two-year plus \nrelationship is difficult to gauge. While Applicant has consistently denied any romantic \nrelationship with the Chinese national (GE 1), his reported history of romantic \nrelationships with other Asian women, his use of Asian dating websites to establish \nonline relationships with two other Chinese nationals before using an Asian dating \nwebsite in 2018 to gain introduction to the Chinese national at issue in the SOR, and the \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndaily contacts he maintained with this Chinese individual for over two years warrant \ndrawn inferences of a much closer pen pal relationship between Applicant and this \nChinese girlfriend than Applicant was willing to profess to, even if their relationship did \nnot reach the level of affection for each other. How involved and personal the \nrelationship grew to be cannot be fully evaluated without tapes or other probative \naccounts of their online text exchanges. \nApplicant and his online Chinese girlfriend have never met or spoken to each \nother. (Tr. 58) He assured that he broke off his online relationship with this Chinese \nnational in June 2020 after receiving the SOR in June 2020. (GE 5; Tr. 63) Since he \nbroke off all contact with this Chinese national, he has never communicated with her or \ntried to make contact with her in any way since his last contact with her in June 2020. \n(Tr. 63-64) The allegations specifically address the status of his online girlfriend, and not \nApplicant\u2019s personal conduct associated with his online contacts with his Chinese \ngirlfriend. And, because his online contacts with this girlfriend have ceased with no \ndemonstrated likelihood of recurrence, SOR coverage of his relationship with this \nChinese national are very limited. \nEndorsements, performance evaluations, and awards \nApplicant is highly regarded by colleagues and friends who have known and \nworked with him. (AE G) Each of his references are familiar with the allegations in the \nSOR and found Applicant to be reliable, trustworthy, and dependable. (AEs G and R) \nTheir expressed interaction with Applicant covered both work and social situations. (AEs \nG and R) None of Applicant\u2019s character references offered any doubt that Applicant \nwould be susceptible to foreign interests and influence. (AEs G and R) All of his \ncharacter sources praised his contributions. \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations for 2018 and 2019 credited Applicant with \nmeeting program requirements for organization and execution of his assigned \nresponsibilities. His evaluations reflect excellent credits for work contributions to his \nemployer. (AEs H-I) \nCountry status of China \nWhile not a country acclaimed to be hostile to U.S. persons and interests, China \nmaintains a relationship with the United States that is more competitive than \ncooperative. China is known to use its intelligence services to collect information about \nthe United States and to obtain advanced technologies. China actively monitors \ninternational communications satellites from operated intercept facilities, in addition to \ncollecting information on U.S. military operations and exercise. See Worldwide Threat \nAssessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community (Jan. 2019); Request for Administrative \nNotice, at 22-3, 8. \nEstablished in 1949, China with over 1.3 billion people is the world\u2019s most \npopulous country.

As a corollary of its authoritarian \nroots, China has never been known for a positive human rights record among Western \nnations an international human rights groups. Part of this can be explained in terms of \nChina\u2019s lack of transparency and any cognizable tradition of respect for developing \ncountries and the rule of law in general.   \nU.S.-China disputes over Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet, and contiguous countries in \nthe South China Sea region can be expected to continue to undermine improvements in \nU.S.-China military relations for the foreseeable future. And, China-sponsored \nespionage aimed at U.S. military and economic interests promise to continue the need \nfor heavy security monitoring over sensitive U.S. industries. \nStill, the United States has sought to build positive, cooperative, and \ncomprehensive relationships with China by expanding areas of cooperation while \naddressing areas of disagreement in the areas of tariff policies, as well as in the fields of \nhuman rights and cybersecurity. See U.S. Relations with China, Fact Sheet, U.S. \ndepartment of State, Bureau East Asian and Pacific affairs at 1-2 (Dec. 2016). \nHistorically, the United States has emphasized the need to enhance trust in its \nbilateral relations with china trough increased high-level exchanges, formal dialogues, \nand expanded people-to-people ties.

The U.S. approach to its economic relations \nwith China has been to integrate China into the global, rules-based economic and \ntrading system and expanding U.S. exporters\u2019 and investors\u2019 access to the China \nmarket. (id., at 1-2) \nHow the recent reciprocal rounds of tariffs imposed by the United States under \nthe Trump Administration (primarily in steel and aluminum) and China through counter \nsanctions (especially in agricultural products) will impact short and long-term trade \nrelations between the two countries is still unclear. Negotiations can hopefully lead to \nimproved trade relations that hold promise for sparing trade wars between China and \nthe United States. \nChina\u2019s collection practices \n \nChina\u2019s actors are the world\u2019s most active and persistent perpetrators of \neconomic espionage.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \n10 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n                                                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. .  .  . AG \u00b6 18. \nForeign Influence \nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern \nif they result in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of \nforeign contacts and interests should consider he country in which the \nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain \nprotected classified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of \nterrorism.

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Additional security concerns are raised over his online \ncontacts with a girlfriend who is a citizen and resident of China. \nFinancial concerns \nApplicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts between 2013 and 2019 warrant \nthe application of three of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration \nguidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19(b), unwillingness to satisfy debts \nregardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations covering his delinquent debts with \nclarifications.

Applicant\u2019s debts \nin issue are fully documented and create some judgment issues as well. See ISCR \nCase No. 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment, and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt \ndelinquencies. \n \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of financial difficulties associated with his long-delinquent home equity and credit \ncard debts over a period of years (2013-2019) preclude his taking full advantage of any \nof the potentially available extenuating and mitigating benefits. While some extenuating \nbenefit to Applicant is warranted here based on his 2012 divorce and ensuing military \ndeployments, application is limited based on all of the circumstances surrounding his \nmanaging of his debts in issue.  \nApplication of MC 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem \nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss \nof employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances,\u201d has partial application. Applicant\u2019s failure to \nsatisfy the second prong (\u201cacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) of MC 20(b) is \nconjunctive and is the key prong that prevents him from gaining any more than limited \napplication of MC 20(b). And, because of the lack of any documented value achieved by \nApplicant from his post-SOR financial counseling, MC \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe individual has \nreceived or is receiving financial counseling for the problem from a legitimate and \ncredible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, and there are clear \nindications that the problem is being solved or is under control,\u201d has only minimal \napplication to applicant\u2019s situation. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts.

As a result, this debt, along with the $241 debt owed to SOR \ncreditor \u00b6 1.e, are resolved favorably to Applicant. \nForeign influence concerns \nSecurity concerns are raised over risks that the personal online relationship \nApplicant shared with a girlfriend between 2018 and 2020, a Chinese national he met \non an Asian dating website in August 2018, might expose Applicant to undue foreign \ninfluence by Chinese government authorities to access classified or sensitive \ninformation in Applicant\u2019s possession or control. Applicant\u2019s relationship with this \nChinese national is still unclear and lacks any profile of the Chinese girlfriend and \ntranscripts of what she and Applicant discussed in the two plus years they \ncommunicated with each other by text exchanges. \nWith so much still unknown about Applicant\u2019s online relationship with the Chinese \nnational covered by the SOR, his recurrent contacts with this individual present \nheightened security risks covered by two disqualifying conditions.

Allegations covered by SOR \u00b6 2.a reflect the status \n14 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nof Applicant\u2019s Chinese girlfriend and not Applicant\u2019s conduct associated with his online \ncontacts with her. \nTo be sure, little is known about the background of Applicant\u2019s online Chinese \ngirlfriend who is a Chinese national. All that is known about this girlfriend is that \nApplicant met her on an Asian dating website and she is citizen and resident of China \nwho reportedly operates a jewelry store in China. Nothing material is known about this \nChina individual\u2019s background and, in particular, whether she has any associations or \nties to Chinese government officials interested in collecting classified, proprietary, or \nsensitive information in the United States. Past reported collection activities by Chinese \ngovernment officials historically have been a major source of security concern about a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s exposure to pressure, coercion, or influence by Chinese \nofficials interested in acquiring sensitive U.S. technology from applicants through their \nfriends and family members in China. See ISCR Case No. 17-04208 at 4-5 (App. Board \nAugust 7, 2019). \nThe AGs governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se results or mandate \nparticular outcomes for applicants with relationships and contacts with persons who are \ncitizens and residents of foreign countries in general. What is considered to be an \nacceptable risk in one country may not be in another. The geopolitical aims and policies \nof the particular country (in this case China) do matter. \nPut another way, the AGs do take into account the country\u2019s demonstrated \nrelations with the United States as an important consideration in gauging whether the \nparticular relative, friend, or contact with citizenship and residency elsewhere create a \nheightened security risk. China is a country that targets the United States and its \ncompanies for economic and proprietary information and has a poor human rights \nrecord to contend with. \nWere Applicant\u2019s personal relationship with his Chinese girlfriend alleged as a \npersonal conduct concern, rather than as a foreign status concern that has since \nceased, his China connections could raise continuing security concerns under both the \nforeign influence and personal conduct guidelines. Allegations covered in SOR \u00b6 2.a do \nnot reach Applicant\u2019 conduct associated with his online contacts with the identified \nindividual that could take account of his contacts with an a Chinese individual that have \nsince ceased. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s cessation of all online contacts with the Chinese national in \nissue, no cognizable recurrence risks can be projected at this time that could place \nApplicant in a situation with this Chines contact that could make Applicant vulnerable \npressure or coercion by any Chinese authorities. Moreover, Applicant has been \nforthcoming about his online contacts with his Chinese girlfriend, enough to warrant the \napplication of mitigating condition (MCs) \u00b6 8(e), \u201cthe individual has promptly complied \nwith existing agency requirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or \nthreats from persons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country,\u201d is fully applicable \nto Applicant\u2019s situation. \n15 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n                \n                \n                 \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance. While Applicant is entitled to credit for his distinguished military \ncareer and civilian contributions to the defense industry, his efforts are not enough at \nthis time to overcome his failures to resolve his accumulated student loan debt \ndelinquencies with good-faith initiatives following his wife\u2019s passing in 2013. \nApplicant\u2019s past and present failures to sufficiently address and resolve his \naccumulated credit card debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d) weaken his ability to mitigate the \nGovernment\u2019s financial concerns. After defaulting on his payment obligations with SOR \ncreditors \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d following his 2012 divorce, he permitted his debts to languish for \nmany years without addressing them. These accumulated debt delinquencies reflect \nadversely on his ability to maintain his finances in a sufficiently stable manner to meet \nthe minimum requirements for holding a security clearance. At this time, it is too soon to \nmake safe predictions that Applicant will be able to maintain his finances in a stable \nmanner compatible with minimum security clearance requirements for the foreseeable \nfuture. \nSecurity concerns created by Applicant\u2019s two-year online relationship with a \nChinese national are mitigated by Applicant\u2019s cessation of all contacts (online or \notherwise) with his Chinse girlfriend with no manifest risks of recurrence. Because the \nallegations in the SOR cover his girlfriend\u2019s status as a Chinese citizen and resident, \nand no Applicant\u2019s personal conduct related to his contacts with the individual, security \nconcerns associated with his girlfriend\u2019s status as a Chinese citizen and resident abated \nwhen Applicant ended his relationship with her. Overall, security concerns attributable to \nApplicant\u2019s online contacts with his Chinese girlfriend are mitigated and afford safe \npredictive judgments about applicant\u2019s ability to withstand risks of undue influence \nattributable to his online relationship with the Chinese national in issue. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations  \nconcerns are not mitigated. Applicant is credited with mitigating foreign influence security \nconcerns.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has approximately $29,000 of delinquent debt. With the exception of \nrecently paying one of the smaller debts ($310) and having two debts closed ($939; $628), \nthe larger debts remain unaddressed by her. She showed that a settlement for one debt \nwas reached (SOR \u00b6 1.f), but she failed to document that she made the settlement \npayments. I find the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties. The SOR debts are recent and all \nbut three small debts remain unresolved. She did not provide sufficient evidence to show \nthat her financial problems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. While \nApplicant dealt with financial conditions beyond her control (her husband\u2019s \nunemployment, requiring her to be the sole wage earner for her family), I find she has not \nacted responsibly in trying to resolve her debts. Her efforts to resolve three small SOR \ndebts are commendable, but insufficient to conclude that her overall financial problems \nare being resolved or are under control. Likewise, she has failed to establish a good-faith \neffort to resolve her remaining delinquent debts. There is no evidence Applicant used a \nfinancial counselor. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) do not apply, except to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, \n1.h-1.i. She failed to produce documentation to support her dispute of SOR \u00b6 1.g. AG \u00b6 \n20(e) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, including her military service and her \nhusband\u2019s unemployment. However, I have also considered her insufficient efforts to \naddress her delinquent SOR debts. Applicant has not established a track record of \nfinancial stability. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b; 1.d, 1.f \u2013 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.c, 1.h \u2013 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges three commercial accounts and two student loans. Applicant admitted all allegations. He indicated that the delinquent debts were caused by paying his father\u2019s bills during his father\u2019s surgeries and ensuing treatment in 2011 and 2018. Even after his father recovered, Applicant continued to pay some of his parents\u2019 delinquent bills. Another reason for the delinquent debts was Applicant\u2019s unemployment for about 30 days in December 2018, when he was involuntarily removed from an employment contract because of a personality clash with another employee.

(AE B; Tr. 18-19) The student loan servicer calculated his \nmonthly repayment amount at $271. According to the repayment agreement, he was \nrequired to make nine consecutive payments. The servicing center explained to him that \ncompliance of the repayment agreement was a requirement for rehabilitating the \nstudent loan. (AE B) \nApplicant provided bank statements (AE E, F, and G) displaying repayments for \nthe student-loan accounts.

Though Applicant has made three \nsuccessive repayments under the agreement, he has five additional payments to make \nto qualify for rehabilitation of his student loans. According to the credit bureau reports \nand Applicant\u2019s testimony, before his student loans became delinquent in 2012, his \nmonthly payment was approximately $575 a month. (Tr. 18-19, 32, 66; GE 3 at 47; GE \n4 at 5, 10-11; GE 7 at 4, 5; AE B) \nApplicant initially testified that he stopped making student-loan payments when \nhis father had his first surgery in 2011. He indicated that he made occasional payments \non his student loans over the life of the loan, but could not indicate when he made those \npayments. He also was helping his parents with their mortgage and other bills, but he \nwas unable to provide any specific details.

(Tr. 22, 26-30) \nBecause of the pandemic, Applicant suspended paying his $1,468 monthly \nmortgage in June 2020, so that he could catch up on his other bills. However, the other \nbills did not include the delinquent student loans listed in the SOR. (Tr. 44) One of the \nother bills was a utility bill. He skipped about seven monthly utility payments \nnecessitating a large payment of over $1,600 in January 2021. (Tr. 45-48; AE F at 5) \nApplicant described his retirement account as a retirement-savings account \nwhere $700 a month was automatically deducted from his paycheck for the past five \nyears. For some unexplained reason, he stopped the automatic deduction recently and \nmakes the monthly deposits himself. His personal financial statement (PFS), dated \nJanuary 27, 2021, indicates that his net monthly remainder after his monthly expenses \nand debts are subtracted from his monthly income, is $4,382. (Tr. 48-50) \nIn February 2021, Applicant invested in stocks for the first time. He made a \n$2,000 investment in a stock on the recommendation of a friend. He stated, \u201cI really \ndon\u2019t know much about it. I just started [it].\u201d (Tr. 50; AE F) \nA review of Applicant\u2019s bank statements (AE E, F, and G) reflect a number of \ntransactions that are large in amount. On March 1, 2021, Applicant loaned $1,000 to a \ncoworker who is also a friend. The friend \u201cwas going through something and he wanted \nhelp.\u201d (Tr. 54; AE E) Applicant loaned the same friend $1,000 in April 2021, and \nexplained that he loaned money to this coworker whenever he needed help. He did not \nknow why he loaned the money, but speculated the coworker had bills or issues with his \nhouse. (Tr. 51-56) \nApplicant described a financial-counseling service in his April 2019 e-QIP. He \nindicated that he was working with a credit service to learn about improving and \nmanaging his credit more effectively. He testified that he may have provided the \ncounseling statement, but claimed that he did not remember, even though he made the \nstatement only two years before the April 2021 hearing. Though he indicated in same \nApril 2019 e-QIP that he had a $477-a-month payment arrangement with the federal \nagency to repay his student loans, he could not remember the arrangement because \u201cI \nspoke to student loans [agency] several times.\u201d He again referred to the passage of \ntime as clouding his memory. (Tr. 66) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept.

The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \n18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also \nbe caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive \ngambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol \nabuse or dependence. An individual who is financially overextended is \nat greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable \nacts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern insofar as it may result \nfrom criminal activity, including espionage. \n19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nHow and when a person pays his bills is a private matter except when evidence \nreveals that he is not paying his debts in a timely fashion. For a security clearance \napplicant, showing irresponsibility toward his personal financial obligations suggests \nthat he may display the same attitude and poor judgment toward security rules and \nregulations he chooses not to follow. Adverse evidence from credit reports can normally \nmeet the Government\u2019s obligation of proving delinquent debts. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. \n14-02403 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply based on his two delinquent student loans and \nthree delinquent commercial accounts. \n20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nApplicant receives mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) for providing \ndocumented evidence verifying settlement of two of the five listed debts within nine \nmonths before he received the SOR. In December 2020, he provided documentation of \nhis payoff of the third commercial creditor. He submitted credible documentation of the \nstudent-loan rehabilitation agreement and three payments made in February, March, \nand April 2021. \nSometimes, unanticipated events materialize to create adverse financial \nconsequences in a person\u2019s life. After discovering his father needed surgery and follow-\nup treatment in 2011 and 2018, Applicant paid his father\u2019s bills and continued to pay \nthem during his father\u2019s recovery. His compassionate response to his father\u2019s medical \nchallenges entitles Applicant to mitigation under the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b). \nHowever, Applicant exhibited poor judgment by not continuing to pay his own \nbills. Except for 30 days in December 2018, Applicant has been steadily employed since \n2010, with an income of $130,000 a year. Given his high income over a ten-year period, \na discretionary monthly remainder of over $4,000, and Applicant\u2019s single marital status \nwith no children, he has had abundant funds available to manage his own financial \nobligations. In sum, Applicant receives only limited mitigation under the second prong of \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe AG \u00b6 20(b), because he did not act responsibly to address his delinquent debts until \nSeptember 2019. \nThe financial entries in Applicant\u2019s bank statements demonstrate financial \nirresponsibility that can be eliminated by devoting more attention to his finances. The \nonly way he can do this is through the assistance of a financial counselor who can teach \nhim to create and maintain a budget that regularly informs him where his money is \ngoing, from income to expenses to savings and retirement. The limited mitigation \nApplicant receives under AG \u00b6 20(c) is based on his settlement of three of the five \ndebts, enrollment in a student-loan rehabilitation agreement, and his preparation of a \nPFS in January 2021. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nFactoring into the favorable decision in this case is Applicant\u2019s forthrightness \nduring the security investigation. In April 2019, he disclosed all his delinquent debts. \nPrior to receiving the SOR in June 2020, Applicant resolved two listed debts. In \nDecember 2020 and January 2021, he took additional action to either resolve the other \ndebt by and by placing the two student loans within a repayment agreement. At the April \n2021 hearing, he provided credible documentation of his overall efforts to resolve the \nlisted debts. \nFinancial counseling will help Applicant manage his finances more responsibly \nso that he does not spend his earnings foolishly. In addition to helping him balance his \ncheckbook, counseling will improve Applicant\u2019s tracking of his income and his \nexpenses. Counseling will also educate Applicant on how to read a credit bureau report \nso that he is aware of all debts at all times. On the other hand, should he choose not to \nobtain counseling, his financial problems will resurface, placing his security clearance \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \neligibility at risk.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR debts are established by the credit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe SOR debts were incurred when Applicant was unable keep up with her student \nloan payments due to her separation in March 2017 and loss of her spouse\u2019s income. I \ncannot find that the debts were incurred so long ago. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. The \ndebts were caused by her separation from her spouse. They, therefore, occurred due to \ncircumstances largely beyond her control. Applicant has not, however, shown that she \nhas acted responsibly to resolve her student loan debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) and (d) do not apply. \nI find against Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.k. \nApplicant has provided plausible explanations for the medical debts. Medical debts \nare often incurred under circumstances largely beyond an applicant\u2019s control. In addition, \nthe magnitude of Applicant\u2019s medical debts does not, in itself, raise security concerns. I \nfind in favor of Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l.through 1.n. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have also considered the whole-person concept. \nApplicant leaves me with questions and doubts as to her eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n        \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n Against Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a, through 1.k:   \nSubparagraphs 1.l through1.n. \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

(Items 3 and 6) \nCountry status of South Korea \nSouth Korea is a stable democratic republic and U.S. ally. The United States and  \nSouth Korea, aka the Republic of Korea (RoK), established diplomatic relations under \nthe 1882 Treaty of Peace, Commerce, and Navigation. See U.S. Relations with the \nRepublic of South Korea, Bilateral Relations Fact Sheet, U.S. Dept. of State (September \n2020). U.S.-South Korean bilateral relations continued until 1905 when Japan assumed \ndirection over South Korea\u2019s foreign affairs. (id.) Beginning in 1910, Japan began a 35-\nyear period of colonial rule over South Korea. \nFollowing Japan\u2019s surrender in 1945, the Korean peninsula was divided at the \n38th  parallel into two occupation zones: one with the United States in the South and \nanother with the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea in the North. See U.S. \nRelations with the Republic of South Korea, Bilateral Relations Fact Sheet, supra;  U.S. \nDepartment of State: Diplomacy in Action, South Korea, at 2-5, U.S., Dept. of State \n(April 2012) On June 25, 1950, North Korean forces invaded the RoK.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nResponding to the North Korean invasion, a UN coalition of 16 countries \nmounted a defense. See id., at 2-3. China, in turn, entered the conflict on behalf of \nNorth Korea later in the year. With a stalemate ensuing between principals of each side, \nan armistice was concluded in July 1953. While a peace treaty has never been signed, \nthe United States and the RoK signed a mutual defense treaty the same year, which \nhas served as the foundation of the enduring alliance that the United States and the \nRoK enjoy today. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn the decades after the war, the RoK experienced political turmoil while \ndeveloping a vocal civil society in responding to authoritarian ruling authority.

This movement contributed to the RoK\u2019s transition to the \nstrengthened democracy the RoK enjoys today. See the World Factbook: South Korea, \nCentral Intelligence Agency (May 2020). \nHuman rights are generally respected by the RoK government. See Republic of \nKorea 2019 Human rights Report, U.S. Dept. of State (March 2020) Significant human \nrights issues extant in the RoK include the existence of criminal libel laws; laws \ncriminalizing consensual same-sex conduct between adults in the military; corruption; \nand other laws limiting freedom of expression and internet access. See id. Addressing \ngovernment corruption problems, the RoK government has taken steps to prosecute \nofficials who committed abuses. (id.)There have no published reports that the \ngovernment or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings. \nWhile the United States and the RoK share a long history of cooperation based \non mutual trust, shared values of democracy, human rights, the rule of law, common \nstrategic interests, and an enduring friendship, the two countries have encountered \ndifferences in recent years in their diplomatic approaches towards North Korea. See \nU.S. Relations with the Republic of Korea, Bilateral Relations Fact Sheet, supra, at 2-4. \nFor instance, the United States has been more assertive in its attempts to curtail North \nKorea\u2019s development of advanced military technology, such as ballistic missiles and \nnuclear weapons. By contrast, the RoK has placed more emphasis on the unification of \nNorth and South Korea, despite its being victimized by North Korean attacks  \n Still, the United States continues to maintain substantial military personnel in the \nRoK in support of its commitment to the RoK under the U.S.-RoK Mutual Defense \nTreaty of 1953 for the purpose of helping the RoK defend itself against external \naggression.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nForeign Influence \nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern \nthey result in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced o help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of \nforeign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the \nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain \nprotected classified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. See AG \u00b6 6. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

While an ecomiic and \nmilitary ally of the United States, the RoK also has the reputation of being one of the \nmost aggressive collectors of economic information and technology in the United \nStates. \nDepartment \nCounsel \nurges \nsecurity \nconcerns \nover \nrisks \nthat \nthe \ncitizenship/residence status of Applicant\u2019s parents and friend in the RoK might be \nsubject to undue influence by RoK government authorities. Because of the status of her \nparents and friend in the RoK, these individuals present potentially potential heightened \nsecurity risks covered by disqualifying conditions (DCs) \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) of the AGs for foreign \ninfluence: \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign \ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d and DC 7(b), \u201cconnections to a foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019 obligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nLittle is known about the backgrounds of Applicant\u2019s parents. All that is known \nabout these immediate family members is that they are citizens and residents of the \nRoK and that Applicant communicates with them regularly without discussing her work \nor security clearance status. Nothing material is known about whether either or both of \nthese family members have any associations or ties to RoK government officials \ninterested in collecting classified or sensitive government information or proprietary \nmaterials in the United States. \nWhile more is known about Applicant\u2019s friend who is currently an intern for the \nRoK, this information is still very limited. Past reported collection activities by RoK \ngovernment officials historically have been a major source of security concern about the \nexposure of relatives and friends holding citizenship and residence status in the RoK to \n7 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npressure, coercion, or influence by RoK officials interested in acquiring sensitive \ntechnology from U.S. applicants or holders of U.S. security clearances. \nThe AGs governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se results or mandate \nparticular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are citizens and residents of \nforeign countries in general. What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign \ncountry may not be in another. The geopolitical aims and policies of the particular \nforeign regime involved do matter. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 5 (App. Bd. May \n19, 2004) Further, even friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over major policy initiatives vital to the security interests of the respective \ncountries, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 02-22461 at 11-12 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005)(citing ISCR Case no. 02-26976 at \n5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2004)(discussing Taiwan). \nWhile there is no evidence of record that intelligence operatives, criminals or \neven terrorists from the RoK seek or have sought classified or economic information \nfrom or through Applicant, such attempts cannot be ruled out pro forma. Before \ndiscounting any material risks of foreign influence being brought to bear on Applicant, \neither directly or indirectly through her South Korean parents and friend, considerations \nmust take account of the RoK\u2019s human rights record, its intelligence-gathering history, \nand the nature of the RoK\u2019s government relationship with the United States. See ISCR \nCase No. 16-02435 at 3 (App. Bd. May 15, 2018)(citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 \nMarch 13, 2017) \n \nMere close ties with a foreign national residing in a foreign country is \n \nnot enough,\nas a matter of law, however, to disqualify an applicant from holding a security clearance.\nNonetheless, the presence of close family members and friends residing in a foreign\ncountry with citizenship status in that country can create the potential for foreign\ninfluence, depending on the circumstances affecting the status of that family member\nand friend, that could potentially result in the compromise of classified or sensitive\ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMitigation is available to Applicant.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his SCA unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 30 years old and was recently married. He has no children. He received his high school diploma in 2009. Shortly after receiving his bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering in May 2018, he began working for a DoD contractor. He works in a position that requires a top secret security clearance. He submitted his SCA in April 2018 in anticipation of commencing his new job three months after his graduation. (Tr. at 20-22.) 2 When Applicant was a young teen, he spent his free time with the \u201cwrong crowd\u201d and became involved in smoking marijuana in 2004. His drug use was typically limited to summers and holidays when he visited an older cousin and the cousin\u2019s friends in a distant state. Despite that, he earned the honor of being admitted to the U.S. Air Force Academy Preparatory School (Prep School). The Prep School prepares athletes such as Applicant and others to succeed at the Air Force Academy. Students at the Prep School are treated as enlistees.

He requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On March 4, 2021, the case was assigned to me. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on March 10, 2021, scheduling the hearing for April 8, 2021. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel presented five \nproposed exhibits, marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were \nadmitted without objection. I marked Department Counsel\u2019s exhibit list as Hearing Exhibit \nI. \nPrior to the hearing, Applicant submitted via three emails six proposed exhibits, \nwhich I marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through F. I marked his emails and \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s responses as Hearing Exhibits II through IV. I kept the record open \nuntil April 15, 2021, to provide Applicant with the opportunity to submit supplemental \nexhibits. He forwarded via email six exhibits on April 9, 2021, which I have marked as AE \nG through L. I have also marked his email, dated April 9, 2021, and Department Counsel\u2019s \nemail response as Hearing Exhibit V. All Applicant exhibits presented at the hearing were \nadmitted into the record without objection. I have also admitted Applicant\u2019s six post-\nhearing exhibits in the absence of an objection from Department Counsel. (Tr. at 11-12, \n14-19; Hearing Exhibit V.) \nAt the conclusion of the testimony, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6 \n1.a to conform to the evidence by modifying the date \u201cJune 2006\u201d to \u201cJune 2004.\u201d The \nsupporting evidence for this motion was: (i) Applicant\u2019s disclosure in his SCA that he first \nused marijuana in June 2004, not June 2006 as alleged in the SOR; and (ii) his testimony \nconfirming that date. Applicant had no objection to the amendment and I granted the \nmotion. The record closed on April 15, 2021. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non April 14, 2021.

After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 30 years old and was recently married. He has no children. He \nreceived his high school diploma in 2009. Shortly after receiving his bachelor\u2019s degree in \nengineering in May 2018, he began working for a DoD contractor. He works in a position \nthat requires a top secret security clearance. He submitted his SCA in April 2018 in \nanticipation of commencing his new job three months after his graduation.

His drug use was typically limited to \nsummers and holidays when he visited an older cousin and the cousin\u2019s friends in a \ndistant state. Despite that, he earned the honor of being admitted to the U.S. Air Force \nAcademy Preparatory School (Prep School). The Prep School prepares athletes such as \nApplicant and others to succeed at the Air Force Academy. Students at the Prep School \nare treated as enlistees. He did not use any marijuana after he was accepted at the Prep \nSchool in April 2009, when he was a high school senior. His father died that summer \nbefore Applicant commenced his studies at the Prep School, which made his transition \naway from home difficult. Nevertheless, he performed very well at the Prep School in both \nhis studies and his athletic activities. He believed he had a promising opportunity and \nfuture at the Air Force Academy and as a future Air Force Officer. As a member of the Air \nForce, he was granted a security clearance. (Tr. at 23-27, 31, 39-40; 55; AE I; AE J.) \nOne day before leaving the Prep School for the Christmas 2009 holiday break, he \nsmoked marijuana with his roommate. His roommate was caught and informed the school \nofficials of Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana with him. After initially denying any drug use, \nApplicant admitted his use and tested positive for marijuana. He was 18 years old. He \nwas expelled from the Prep School and discharged from the Air Force the next day. His \nDD 214 reflects that he received an \u201cUncharacterized\u201d \u201cEntry Level Separation.\u201d It is not \na punitive discharge. In his SCA, he mistakenly wrote that he received an Other Than \nHonorable (OTH) discharge. Applicant was \u201cvery devastated\u201d by the adverse impact his \npoor judgment had on his future with the Air Force. (Tr. at 23-27, 50-51, 58-59; GE 1 at \n27; AE G.) \nFollowing his arrival at home in disgrace, Applicant tried to repent for his mistake \nby working in his church community and performing services helping others. He attended \ncommunity college in the spring of 2010. He transferred to a four-year university in 2011 \nand waited on tables to pay for his living expenses. He transferred to a second university \ncloser to home in 2012. He also enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve in October 2012 to \nfulfill his desire to serve in the military. He required a security clearance and was unaware \nthat his 2009 eligibility had not been revoked. He mistakenly understood that he was \ngranted a security clearance in connection with his Army Reserve duty. He accessed \nclassified information for the first and only time in the military when he received his \nadvanced individual training during the period February to April 2013. After his basic \ntraining and advanced training were completed, he returned home. (Tr. at 27-34, 40-42, \n51-52, 58; AE H.) \nUpon his return, Applicant used marijuana again with another cousin who was \nattending college in Applicant\u2019s home area. In July 2013, Applicant was arrested for \npossession of marijuana while sitting in a car in front of his home. He was 22 years old. \nHe testified that this use of marijuana was one of the rare occasions he smoked marijuana \nat that time in his life. He received deferred adjudication and was put on probation for six \nmonths. He was also required to attend drug-education classes. He did not smoke \nmarijuana while on probation.

He used marijuana occasionally until summer 2017. He would contribute to \nthe cost of marijuana when it was being used. (Tr. at 32-36, 45-47.) \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance had not changed since 2009. He only \naccessed classified information during a three-month training period in 2013 and never \nfunctioned in a classified work environment with the Army Reserve. He did not understand \nhis responsibilities as someone eligible for a clearance with respect to drug use. In fact, \nhe did not even understand at the hearing that he remained eligible to hold a clearance \nafter he was discharged from the Air Force in 2009. In mid-2017, he made a decision to \nstop using marijuana completely for reasons unrelated to his clearance status. He \nbecame focused on finding an internship and planning his career after graduating the \nfollowing year. At around the same time, he met his future wife, who disapproved of his \nuse of marijuana. He shifted his friendships to other engineers who were not users of \nmarijuana. In the fall of 2017, he received a job offer from his current employer for a \nposition to begin after he graduated. He was discharged from the Army Reserve in \nOctober 2018 with the rank of Sergeant (E-5) after starting his current position with the \ndefense contractor. (Tr. at 32-36, 45-47; AE F.) \nSOR Allegations \nParagraph 1 of the SOR sets forth four allegations under Guideline H. \nSubparagraph 1.a, as amended, alleges that Applicant used marijuana \u201cwith varying \nfrequency\u201d from about June 2004 to about July 2017. The other allegations are that he \npurchased marijuana with varying frequency from June 2006 to July 2017 (\u00b6 1.b); that he \nused marijuana during the period of November 2009 to July 2017 while holding a security \nclearance (\u00b6 1.c); and that he tested positive for marijuana usage in 2009 (\u00b61.d). \nParagraph 2 of the SOR sets forth two allegations under Guideline J. Subparagraph 2.a \nalleges that Applicant received an OTH discharge from the U.S. Air Force in 2009. The \nsecond allegation states that Applicant was arrested in approximately 2013 for \npossession of marijuana and received deferred adjudication (\u00b6 2.b). \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted each of the allegations and provided detailed \nbackground information. As discussed below, he incorrectly believed that his discharge \nfrom the Air Force was characterized as under other than honorable conditions, and he \ntherefore admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6 2.a. As noted, he received an Entry Level \nSeparation. \nWhole-Person Evidence \nApplicant provided substantial evidence regarding his character and his current \nviews on using illegal drugs. One exhibit in the record is a Clinical Marijuana Assessment \nprepared by a licensed social worker (LSW). The LSW concluded his assessment with \nthe statement that Applicant \u201cappears poised to continue abstaining from cannabis \nwithout any apparent difficulty.\u201d The LSW also wrote that no treatment recommendations \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \nwere necessary.

His family members praised him for his seriousness \nand committed religious beliefs. He has also submitted a signed statement of intent \naffirming his intention to abstain from ever using marijuana in the future with an \nacknowledgement that any future involvement or misuse of illegal drugs would be \ngrounds for the revocation of his national security eligibility. (AE A-L.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Apr. 20, 2016). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24 as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG & 25 contains seven disqualifying conditions that could raise \nsecurity concerns. Four of the conditions potentially apply: \n(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(b): testing positive for an illegal drug; \n(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer and his testimony and the documentary \nevidence in the record establish each of the four allegations under H allegations in the \nSOR. The burden now shifts to Applicant to provide mitigation. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from illegal drug use. Two of the conditions have possible applicability \nto the facts of this case: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s evidence established both of the above mitigating conditions. He was \nan infrequent user of marijuana who started using the illegal drug as a young teen. He \nwas influenced by older cousins and others. He was involved with the wrong crowd at a \ntime when he was also a high achiever, having been selected to attend the Prep School \nin preparation for him becoming a student at the Air Force Academy and a future Air Force \nofficer. He entered the Prep School while grieving over the death of his father. He made \npoor choices in his attempts to manage his grief, and he paid dearly for his mistake at the \nPrep School. On and off over the subsequent years, Applicant continued to make poor \nchoices. In the summer of 2017, almost four years ago, he decided to abstain from using \nmarijuana ever again. Since then he graduated from college, married his college \ngirlfriend, and obtained employment at an important defense contractor. Applicant\u2019s \ncommitment to continue this important change in his life makes it unlikely that he will ever \nuse marijuana again. His wife strongly supports his abstention. \nDuring much of his past use of marijuana, Applicant held a security clearance. His \nunderstanding of the responsibilities that accompany eligibility for a clearance when he \nwas not in a classified work environment was vague. He was also unaware that he held \neligibility after his discharge from the Air Force and before his enlistment in the Army \nReserve. Under the circumstances, he has mitigated the security concerns raised by his \npast mistakes. He has acknowledged his past drug use and taken steps to overcome this \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproblem. He has disassociated himself from drug-using friends and has signed a \nstatement of intent to abstain from illegal drug use in the future. Moreover, he has \nestablished a substantial period of abstinence. In light of all of the record evidence, \nApplicant\u2019s past drug use does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. Applicant has mitigated security concerns under Guideline H. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline at AG & 31 contains five disqualifying conditions that could raise \nsecurity concerns. Three of the conditions potentially apply: \n(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\"Honorable.\" \n \nThe record evidence does not establish allegation 2.a of the SOR, which asserts \nthat Applicant received an OTH discharge in 2009. Applicant\u2019s admission of his arrest for \npossessing marijuana in 2013 partially establishes the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 \n31(a). The single SOR allegation of an arrest in 2013 does not constitute a \u201cpattern of \nminor offenses.\u201d Applicant did, however, commit unalleged offenses of possessing \nmarijuana on multiple occasions, which were indirectly the subjects of allegations in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c regarding Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana.  \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 32 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from criminal conduct. Two of the conditions have possible applicability \nto the facts of this case: \n(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s evidence established mitigation under both of the above-quoted \nmitigating conditions. The SOR allegation in 2.b is specifically limited to Applicant\u2019s 2013 \narrest, which was a long time ago. Also, Applicant\u2019s abstention from illegally possessing \nand using marijuana for nearly four years evidences that his criminal conduct is unlikely \nto recur. The 2013 arrest does not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. Applicant\u2019s evidence of rehabilitation is impressive. He finished his probation \nand earned his bachelor\u2019s degree. He has an excellent employment record and is \ninvolved in his community. Applicant has mitigated security concerns under Guideline J. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and J in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under these guidelines, but \nsome warrant additional comment. Applicant is an impressive young man, who \nexperienced the loss of his father at a significant point in Applicant\u2019s life. He dealt with his \ngrief immaturely as he was quite young. In 2017 at the age of 26, he made a commitment \nto himself to never again use marijuana. With the help of his girlfriend who he married in \n2020, he has made an important shift towards being more mature and responsible. He \nhas shown his commitment to living a highly functional adult life through his \naccomplishments in his employment. He is now fulfilling his potential that he temporarily \nlost when he was expelled from the Prep School and discharged from the Air Force at the \nage of 18. After weighing the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions and \nevaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his drug involvement and criminal conduct. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Criminal Conduct: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interests of the United States \nto grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant is indebted to a creditor for a collection account in the amount of \n$524. Applicant claims that he was not aware of the debt until November 2019 when he \nmet with the DoD investigator. (Government Exhibit 5.) Applicant states that he has \ndisputed the debt.  He has failed to provide any documentation pertaining to the dispute. \nThere is no evidence in the record to show that the debt has been resolved. The debt \nremains owing. (Government Exhibit 3.) \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record to show that Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts have been resolved. In August 2020, Applicant retained the services of a debt \nresolution company to help him settle his delinquent accounts for less than the balance \ndue. Six of the debts alleged in the SOR totaling $13,307 are included in the debt \nresolution settlement program. Applicant has not submitted any evidence showing that \nhe has made any payments in accordance with the agreement. In regard to those debts \nthat were not included in the debt resolution settlement program, Applicant has not \nshown that he has addressed them. There is no proof of payments, receipts, or any \nother documentation to show that he has paid off or is paying any of his outstanding \ndebts. His credit reports do not show that any of his debts have been resolved. The \neffort he has made, which was to hire the debt resolution company, is not enough, and \nwas done at such a late date that its meaning is insignificant. He has also not provided \ninformation regarding the delinquent accounts he disputes or the basis for the disputes. \nOverall, Applicant shows no progress towards resolving his debts. He still owes a \nsignificant amount of money to his creditors that he obviously cannot afford to pay. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record to show that the Applicant has carried his \nburden of proof to establish mitigation of the government security concerns under \nGuideline F. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debt regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant is delinquently indebted in excess of $26,500. \nHis actions \ndemonstrated both a history of not addressing his debt and an inability to do so. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations are \npotentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \nIt is recognized that Applicant\u2019s divorce, which can be considered to be largely \nbeyond his control, caused some financial difficulties that have contributed to his \ndelinquent debts. However, five years have passed since his divorce in 2016 and he \nremains excessively indebted. Since then, Applicant has been gainfully employed and \nhe has not sufficiently addressed his delinquent debts. His inaction casts doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. None of the mitigating conditions \nare applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.  through 1.m.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR with an undated Answer, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was originally assigned to another \njudge, and reassigned to me on January 20, 2021. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) had already issued a notice of hearing on December 22, 2020, \nscheduling the hearing for February 4, 2021. The hearing was convened as scheduled. \nThe Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 7, which were admitted into \nevidence. Applicant testified on her own behalf.

She has held a \nsecurity clearance since 2006. She is unmarried, and has no children. Applicant has a \nMaster\u2019s in Business Administration. (TR at page 15 line 1 to page 17 line 12.) \nShe attributes her financial difficulties to \u201ca [legal] dispute with . . . [a] contractor\u201d \nover a remodel of a house Applicant purchased in 2012. (TR at page 18 lines 1~17.)  \nApplicant testified as follows: \u201cduring this, paying the lawyer was very expensive.

Prior to this legal \ndispute, Applicant admits to gambling about \u201cevery other month.\u201d (TR at page 19 lines \n9~17.) After the legal dispute her gambling increased to \u201cevery other week . . . [her] \npaycheck . . . about $2,200.\u201d (TR at page 19 line 25 to page 20 line 8.) Applicant \u201chit the \nrock bottom\u201d and decided to file for the Bankruptcy (discussed below). This gambling \npattern continued for \u201cabout a year,\u201d about five years prior to her hearing. (TR at page \n21 lines 2~7.) Applicant still gambles between $1,000~$1,500, \u201cevery few months,\u201d the \nlast time being in December of 2020, four months after the issuance of the SOR. (TR at \npage 21 line 14 to page 22 line 5.) \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations  \n2 \n \n1.a. and 1.b.  Applicant filed for the protection of a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in \nFebruary of 2016. She avers that she could not keep up with the monthly $1,900 plan \npayments; and as such, \u201cinstead of gambling, I did another bad thing, which was \nPayday Loans.\u201d (TR at page 26 lines 18~23.) This first bankruptcy was dismissed in \nSeptember of 2018 for failure to make the plan payments. \n \nApplicant next withdrew funds from her \u201c401K\u201d; not realizing the tax \nconsequences, which led to her second Chapter 13 Bankruptcy filing in October of \n2018. In October of 1919, that petition was also dismissed for failure to make plan \npayments. (TR at page 27 line 1 to page 28 line 21.) These allegations are found \nagainst Applicant. \n \n1.c. Applicant admits that she is indebted to the Federal government, as a result \nof 401K withdraws, in the amount of about $12,995. After her hearing, Applicant set up \na payment plan with the IRS, by which she will make monthly payments of $300 \ntowards this tax debt. (TR at page 28 line 21 to page 33 line 2.) This is evidenced by \ndocumentation. (AppX A.) As a result of this good-faith effort, this allegation is found for \nApplicant. \n\n \n \n \n \n1.d. Applicant admits that she was indebted to the state government, as a result \nof 401K withdraws, in the amount of about $9,030. After her hearing, Applicant set up a \npayment plan, by which she makes monthly payments of $400 towards this tax debt. \n(TR at page 28 line 21 to page 33 line 2.) Her state tax debt has been reduced to \n$6,949. This is evidence by documentation. (AppXs B and C.) As a result of this good-\nfaith effort, this allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.e. Applicant denies that she has a past-due debt as the result of an automobile \nloan in the amount of about $3,900. She avers that this debt is \u201cpaid that off fully . . . \nand . . . [that she] gifted that car to . . . [her] nephew.\u201d (TR at page 33 line 3 to page 34 \nline 24.) This averment is supported by documentation from \u201cCARFAX\u201d; and as such, \nthis allegation is found for Applicant. (AppX D.) \n \n \n1.f. Applicant denies that she has a past-due mortgage debt in the amount of \nabout $15,610. She avers that this debt \u201cwill be caught up . . . by the end of March.\u201d (TR \nat page 35 line 1 to page 36 line 15.) This averment is supported by an April 1, 2021 \ncredit report (CR) showing the mortgage debt is \u201cin good standing\u201d; and as such, this \nallegation is found for Applicant. (AppX F at page 34.) \n \n \n1.g. Applicant admits that she was indebted to Creditor G for a past-due debt in \nthe amount of about $5,785. This debt is included in a debt-consolidation plan by which \nApplicant makes monthly payments of $779.08. (TR at page 36 line 16 to page 40 line \n4, and AppX E.) The current past-due amount is $4,000. (AppX E at page 3.) This \nallegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.h. Applicant admits that she was indebted to Creditor H for a past-due credit-\ncard debt in the amount of about $1,000. Applicant avers that she is current with this \ncreditor, which averment is supported by her April 1, 2021 CR. (TR at page 40 lines \n5~15, and AppX F at pages 16~17.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.i. Applicant admits that she is indebted for interest on a past-due Payday Loan \nin the amount of about $13,810. This debt is not included in Applicant\u2019s debt \nconsolidation plan, despite her averments to the contrary. (TR at page 40 line 17 to \npage 41 line 44, at page 52 lines 10~13, and AppX E at page 3.) This allegation is \nfound against Applicant. \n \n \n1.j. Applicant admits that she was indebted to Creditor J for a past-due debt in \nthe amount of about $1,058. This debt is included in a debt consolidation plan by which \nApplicant makes monthly payments of $779.08. (TR at page 51 lines 17~21, at page 52 \nline 23 to page 53 line 4, and AppX E at page 3.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.k. Applicant admits that she was indebted to Creditor K for a past-due debt in \nthe amount of about $4,757. This debt is included in a debt consolidation plan by which \nApplicant makes monthly payments of $779.08. (TR at page 42 line 1 to page 43 line \n20, and AppX E at page 3.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n1.l. Applicant admits that she is indebted on a past-due Payday type loan in the \namount of about $4,007.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.

The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Seven are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators; \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired; \n(h) borrowing money or engaging in significant financial transactions to \nfund gambling or pay gambling debts; and \n(i) concealing gambling losses, family conflict, or other problems caused \nby gambling. \nApplicant has an obvious gambling problem. This, coupled with poor financial \ndecisions such as unsuccessful bankruptcy filings, and taking out Payday type loans, \nonly exacerbated Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. She has a long history of failed \nbankruptcies, and delinquencies. Although Applicant has addressed her tax \ndelinquencies, she has just began a consolidation of her debts, but said consolidation \ndoes not appear to include all of Applicant\u2019s past-due debts. Applicant has not \ndemonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has \nnot been established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c~1.h: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.m and 1.n: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.p~1.r: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Applicant\u2019s request for eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 18, 2019, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for access to classified information \nas part of her employment with a defense contractor. After reviewing the completed \nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Department of Defense (DOD) could not \ndetermine that it was clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant \nto have access to classified information, as required by Executive Order 10865, as \namended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive). \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nOn September 23, 2020, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nfacts and security concerns addressed under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The adjudicative guidelines (AG) cited in the SOR \nwere issued by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) on December 10, 2016, to be \neffective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. Applicant timely responded to the \nSOR (Answer) and requested a decision without a hearing. \nOn December 2, 2020, as provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, \nDepartment Counsel for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) that was received by Applicant on January 13, 2021. \nThe FORM contained six exhibits (Items 1 \u2013 6) on which the Government relies to support \nthe SOR allegations. Applicant was informed she had 30 days from receipt of the FORM \nto submit additional information. She did not submit anything further and the record closed \non February 12, 2021. I received the case for decision on March 12, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owes $42,534 for ten \ndelinquent debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.j). Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant \nintentionally falsified her responses to questions in e-QIP Section 26 (Financial Record) \nwhen she failed to list the debts alleged at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.i. (SOR 2.a) \nIn response, Applicant admitted with explanations the allegations at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.j. \nHer Answer (FORM, Item 2) consisted of a one-page statement, a two-page response to \neach SOR allegation, and 16-pages of documents in support thereof organized by each \nGuideline F allegation. As to SOR 2.a, Applicant in her one-page statement denied \nintentionally withholding adverse financial information from her e-QIP. In addition to the \nfacts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom she has \nworked since September 2019, and who is sponsoring her request for a security \nclearance. After graduating from college in June 2017, Applicant worked for two years for \na different company in a similar position; however, she did not require a security clearance \nfor that job. This is her first application for clearance. (FORM, Items 3 and 4) \nApplicant disclosed in her e-QIP the delinquent utility bill alleged at SOR 1.j, stating \nthat she was in the process of setting up a repayment plan. She also listed a $706 state \nincome-tax debt for the 2018 tax year, which she paid off in September 2019; and a past-\ndue $234 debt for unpaid insurance premiums, also paid off in September 2019. By the \nlanguage of e-QIP Section 26 questions about delinquent routine accounts, and as \ndocumented by a credit report obtained by investigators shortly after she submitted her \ne-QIP, Applicant also should have listed the debts at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.i. During a personal \nsubject interview (PSI) with a government investigator on October 7, 2019, and in \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant attributed her omissions of this information to confusion \nabout what information the questionnaire required. (FORM, Items 2 \u2013 4) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began when she moved in with her now-ex-\nboyfriend in February 2018. They lived together until she ended the relationship and \nmoved in with her parents in January 2019. During that relationship, Applicant claims she \nhad to pay most of their joint living expenses and debts. The debts at SOR 1.d, and 1.g \n\u2013 1.j were incurred and became delinquent during her relationship with her ex-boyfriend. \nApplicant paid off SOR 1.h in November 2019, and completed a repayment plan for SOR \n1.i in March 2020. The debts at SOR 1.g and 1.j were paid off in September 2020. In \nOctober 2020, Applicant began a $250 per month repayment plan to resolve SOR 1.d, \nwhich is the balance due after resale of a car that was repossessed in October 2018. \n(FORM, Item 2 - Appendix A; Items 3 \u2013 6) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant incurred the debts alleged at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.c, 1.e and 1.f before moving \nin with her ex-boyfriend. They became delinquent because she was saddled with paying \nmost of their financial obligations for about 11 months. SOR 1.a \u2013 1.c are being resolved \nthrough a debt-repayment plan established through a credit-counseling company in \nSeptember 2020. That plan calls for resolution of her three largest debts through a single \nmonthly payment of $1,099 over the next three years. The credit-counseling service also \nhelped Applicant review her monthly budget and determine that after her expenses, \nincluding all of her ongoing debt payments, she has about $1,900 remaining. Because \nshe lives with her parents, Applicant has no housing costs such as mortgage or rent. She \nhas not incurred any new delinquencies and she has about $24,000 in savings. (FORM, \nItem 2 - Appendix A) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAvailable information shows that between 2018 and 2019, Applicant became \ndelinquent or past due for ten debts totaling $42,534. When the SOR was issued in \nSeptember 2020, only four of those debts remained unresolved; however, those four \ndebts represent about 83 percent of the total debt at issue here. This information \nreasonably raises the security concerns articulated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n \nMore specifically, the Government\u2019s information requires application of the \nfollowing AG \u00b6 19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nI also have considered the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are recent and frequent. She incurred significant \ndebt through multiple accounts, with most of the total debt still unresolved. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. By contrast, Applicant\u2019s financial problems arose from circumstances \nbeyond her control and are not likely to recur. She established that she acted responsibly \nby ending the relationship which caused much of her financial distress, moving in with her \nparents to cut her expenses, and beginning to address her debts. Although not alleged in \nthe SOR, in 2018, Applicant incurred a state income-tax debt and a delinquent insurance \ndebt. She paid off both debts in 2019. In 2019, she also paid off SOR 1.h and began \npaying down the SOR 1.j, completing that effort in September 2020. Also in 2020, \nApplicant paid off SOR 1.e \u2013 1.g, and 1.i. Applicant is now engaged in a structured plan \nfor debt repayment and financial counseling that will result in paying off SOR 1.a \u2013 1.c in \nthree years and improving her overall finances. Concurrently, she is repaying the debt at \nSOR 1.d. The monthly budget she submitted shows that she has a significant net monthly \nremainder after expenses, including all of her debt payments. She also has savings \nsufficient to help her tolerate unforeseen expenses. \nAll of the foregoing supports \napplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) \u2013 20(d) and shows that Applicant\u2019s finances will not present \nsimilar concerns in the future. The security concerns under this guideline are mitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is stated in relevant part at AG \u00b6 15 as \nfollows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nIn SOR 2.a, it was alleged that Applicant intentionally withheld adverse information \nabout debts when she responded to e-QIP Section 26 questions. Applicant\u2019s denial of \nthat allegation created a controverted issue of fact, which left the burden of proving that \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \nallegation with the Government. Available information established that she omitted the \ndebts at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.i; however, to be disqualifying her omissions must be shown to be \nintentional, as stated in AG \u00b6 16(a): \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant disclosed one of the debts alleged in the SOR, as well as two others not \nat issue here. Available information probative of her intent tends to show that she was not \ntrying to hide the fact she had unpaid debts, explaining among her disclosures that she \nexperienced about a year of financial hardship. With these facts in mind, her claim that \nshe may have been confused about what she was required to disclose is plausible. \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant did not intend to falsify her answers or to mislead the \ngovernment about her financial problems. The security concerns alleged under this \nguideline are resolved for the Applicant. In addition to my evaluation of the facts and \napplication of the appropriate adjudicative factors under Guidelines E and F, I have \nreviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 \n2(d). A fair and commonsense assessment of all of the available information in this case \nsupports a conclusion in favor of the Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j: \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request \nfor security clearance eligibility is granted. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate financial consideration or personal conduct concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information or to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 27, 2020, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Central \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the financial considerations guideline the DoD could not make the \npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

A hearing was scheduled for June 24, \n2021, and heard on the date as scheduled through the Government\u2019s Defense \nCollaborative System (DCS). At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of six \nexhibits. (GEs 1-6) Applicant relied on six exhibits (AEs a-F) and one witness (herself). \nThe transcript (Tr.) was received on August 3, 2020. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the opening of the hearing, the Government moved to amend the SOR to \nadd allegations under Guideline E as follows: Add SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a to 2.d, to allege \nApplicant falsified material facts in her electronic questionnaires for investigations \nprocessing (e-QIP) of January 16, 2018 and personal subject interview (PSI) of \nSeptember 2018, ,by failing to disclose her failure to pay her federal income taxes \nwithin the previous seven years. \nResponding to the Government\u2019s amendment motion, Applicant denied falsifying \nher e-QIP, claiming she did not knowingly and willfully fail to disclose any tax debt \ninformation in her January 2018 e-QIP. Applicant denied knowingly and willfully failing \nto disclose tax delinquency information to the government investigator who interviewed \nher September 2018.  \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated (a) delinquent taxes owed \nthe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years 2013-2016 in the aggregate amount of \n$50,449; (b) 18 delinquent student loans exceeding $108,000; four medical debts \nexceeding $11,000; and (d) four consumer debts exceeding $2.400. Allegedly, these \ndebts remain unresolved and outstanding. unresolved. \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the alleged delinquent \ndebts with explanations. She denied the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.aa-1.dd,\nclaiming none of these debts appeared on her credit report. For those SOR-listed debts\nshe admitted, she added claims as follows: She had a payment arrangement with the \nIRS that permits the IRS to keep all of her eligible refunds and will begin making \npayments in January 2021 to the IRS to cover the balance owing for tax years 2013-\n2016 without specifying the specific amounts owing. Addressing her listed student loan \ndebts, she claimed she is waiting on a decision from the U.S. Department of Education \n(DoE) on her loan deferral application. And, she claimed that she could not locate the \nalleged consumer debts listed in the SOR.                                                                          \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

GE 2; Tr. 60-61)  \nIn June 2015, Applicant entered into an installment agreement with the IRS to \npay off her accrued $1,139 in back taxes for the covered tax years of 2013-2016, in \naddition to added interest and penalties. (GE 2) From the submitted IRS transcripts for \ntax years 2013-2016, Applicant was credited with $16,461 in withholding on her $31,139 \nin calculated taxes owed for tax years 2012-2015, leaving a total shortfall of $14,478. \nFor these taxes still owed, the IRS added interest and penalties that brought the amount \nowed for these tax years to $50,490. (GEs 1-3) \nFor the two years Applicant\u2019s 2016 installment agreement remained in force, \nApplicant made no documented voluntary payments in compliance with the terms of her \nIRS agreement. (GEs 1-3) During this tax period, she deferred to the IRS in the \nService\u2019s attaching of her credited tax refunds to fulfill the terms of her installment \nagreement. (GEs 1-3) Compounding her tax payment defaults with her installment \nagreement, Applicant was taxed on her 401(k) loans by the IRS, who treated her loans \nas withdrawals for tax purposes, after she reportedly failed to comply with her loan \nrepayment terms.

(GE 2; Tr. 52-53) And, in October 2018, the IRS issued a notice of a \nfederal tax lien filing. (GE 3) To avert potential tax levies on her earnings, she entered \ninto a second installment agreement with the IRS in August 2018 to cover her back \ntaxes owed for tax years 2013-2016. (GE 2) For several months in 2016, she complied \nwith the IRS\u2019s repayment terms with monthly $300 payments. (Tr. 24) Lacking sufficient \nresources to keep up with her monthly IRS payments, she ceased making her $300 \nmonthly payments and defaulted on her 2018 installment agreement with the IRS. (Tr. \n2) \nFinding in July 2019 that Applicant had failed to stay compliant with the terms of \nher 2018 installment agreement, the IRS canceled Applicant\u2019s installment agreement \nand placed her in a levy program. (GE 2; Tr. 56) For the past two years, Applicant has \nrelied on the IRS\u2019s involuntary attachments of her approved tax refunds to cover her \nowed back taxes. (GE 3; Tr. 59-60) Since being returned to a collectible status, she has \nnot tried to work with the IRS on negotiating a new repayment plan, and has accepted \nthe IRS garnishment of her designated refunds as her chosen means of satisfying her \nfederal tax obligations. (Tr. 60-61) \nIn July 2020, Applicant was notified by the IRS that her accrued tax debts for tax \nyear 2014 has been referred to a private collection agency. (AE D) While the accrued \ntax debts for the remaining years were not included in the collection assignment, \npresumably they remain unresolved and subject to collection enforcement as well. \nBesides her IRS debts, Applicant has accumulated delinquent student loan debts \nto the lenders who financed her college education (covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6s 1.b-1.h and \n1.m-1.w). (GEs 1-6; Tr. 26-27) Between March 2006 and June 2010, Applicant \naccumulated over $108,000 in student loans to cover both her on-line and on-site \ncollege courses. (GEs 2 and 4-6 and AE E; Tr. 14) These loans became delinquent in \nJune 2013 and have not been addressed by Applicant to date with payment or payment \nplans. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s student loans are currently deferred under the Cares Act, she \nwill need a new payment plan once the deferment expires. She continues to wait for the \ndisposition of her borrower\u2019s defense application that she filed in August 2019. (AE E; \nTr. 13-14, 20) Applicant\u2019s student loan delinquencies still total more than $108,000 in \naggregate loan indebtedness and can be expected to be returned to default status by \nher student loan lender once her deferment expires.  (GE 2, 4-6 and AE E) \nAdditional delinquent debts accumulated by Applicant include four medical debts \nexceeding $1,100 (covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.aa-1.cc) and four consumer debts \nexceeding $2,400 (covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6. 1.i, 1.x, 1.z, and 1.dd). These debts are well \ndocumented in Applicant\u2019s credit reports (GEs 4-6), and were acknowledged by \nApplicant to belong to her in her PSI. (GE 2) While they no longer appear on her latest \ncredit report, she provided no probative evidence of her own of ever paying these debts \n(AE A; Tr. 74-77) Still, because these debts were not validated in her most recent June \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n                     \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2021 credit report, Applicant disclaimed them and provided no assurances that she \nwould ever pay them.

She reported gross monthly income of $3,765 and net \nmonthly income of $939.

(Tr. 70) \nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP and PSI omissions \nAsked to complete an e-QIP in January 2018, Applicant failed to disclose her \nowed federal income taxes for the previous seven years (i.e., for federal tax years 2013-\n2017). (GEs 1-3) In her 2018 e-QIP, she also omitted her current federal taxes owed. \nClaiming she paid some federal taxes owed prior to 2018 (although not all), Applicant\ndenied any knowing and willful intent to falsify her e-QIP. (Tr. 47-48) Applicant\u2019s\nexplanations lack sufficient plausibility and credibility to satisfy evidentiary proof\nrequirements and are not persuasive enough to avert inferences of knowing and willful\nfailure to list her back federal taxes owed for tax years 2015-2016.                                    \n \n \n \n \nIn a follow-up PSI with an OPM investigator in September 2018, Applicant was \nasked by the investigator whether she had any delinquent federal debt, she answered \n\u201cyes\u201d and listed her federal student loans without mentioning her delinquent federal \ntaxes. owed. (GE 2) She declined to provide any voluntary affirmative answers to the \ninvestigator about her delinquent federal taxes, and the investigator never broached the \nsubject. (GE 2; Tr. 54-55) Citing her placement in a non-collectible tax status, she \nclaimed she did not knowingly and willfully omit material tax information in her e-QIP. \n(Tr. 22-23) By the time of her PSI in September 2018, however, her non-collectible tax \nstatus had been changed back by the IRS to a collectible status. (Tr. 55) Acknowledging \nthe status change, Applicant claimed she was still negotiating with the IRS over a new \nrepayment plan. \nSo, even though Applicant had not made more than a few $300 payments to the \nIRS under her 2016 installment agreement, she failed to acknowledge her delinquent \ntax debts to the OPM investigator who interviewed her in September 2018. (Tr. 56) \nAsked why she declined to mention her change of tax status to a collectible status to the \ninvestigator during her PSI, she declined to provide any clear explanation of her actions. \n(Tr. 55) \nApplicant\u2019s claims of a lack of any practical working knowledge of any federal tax \ndebts owed when she completed her 2018 e-QIP and when she later appeared for her \nfollow-up PSI in September 2018, are not reconcilable with her hearing \nacknowledgements of owing back federal taxes for tax years 2013-2016.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated  by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  .  .  .  AG \u00b6 18.   \n Personal Conduct \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure \nto cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes.  . . .  AG \u00b6 15. \n       Burdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec.

See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 \n(6th  ed. 2006). Her admitted debts are fully documented and create judgment issues as \nwell over the management of her finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 (App. Bd. \nSept. 24, 2004).

See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s \ncited financial difficulties associated with her lengthy history of accumulating delinquent \ndebts in connections with her federal taxes, student loans, and medical and consumer \naccounts preclude her from taking advantage of most of the potentially available \nextenuating and mitigating benefits. While some extenuating benefit to Applicant is \nwarranted based on her reported period of unemployment between 2016 and 2018, her \npersonal obligations for the back federal taxes, student loans, medical, and consumer \ndebts remained with her following her return to full-time employment in 2018. \nApplication of mitigating condition MC 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d has partial application. Applicant\u2019s failure \nto satisfy the second prong (\u201cacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) of MC 20(b) \nis conjunctive and is the key prong that prevents her from gaining any more than limited \napplication of MC 20(b) \nWhile Applicant is credited with utilizing financial counseling services, most of \nthese services were devoted to repairing her credit report with the removal of creditors \nwith listed old debts, and much less in helping Applicant to address her overdue debts \nwith workable repayment plans. Without more evidence of financial counseling designed \nto help Applicant resolve her debts, MC \u00b6 20(c) cannot be applied to the facts of \nApplicant\u2019s case. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through\nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. ISCR case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May\n21, 2008) In Applicant\u2019s case, she has failed to take any documented voluntary steps to\naddress her accumulated delinquent federal tax, student loan, medical, and consumer\ndebts and provide persuasive proof of her voluntary addressing her delinquent debts at\nbay.   \n \n \n \n \n \nDebts reduced through involuntary initiatives, such as creditor garnishments, \nattachments, and foreclosures, generally do not meet the mitigation requirements of MC \n\u00b6 20d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith to repay overdue creditors \nor otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Likewise, delinquent debts claimed to have been paid \nrequire documented proof of payment. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has consistently imposed evidentiary burdens on applicants to \nprovide documentation corroborating actions taken to resolve financial problems, \nwhether the issues relate to back taxes, student loans, or other debts and accounts. \nSee ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-\n01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). For similar reasons, potentially applicable statutes \nof limitation and debts removed from credit reports for reasons other than payment or \nresolution by other voluntary means (to include successful disputes of debts) cannot be \nequated with good-faith efforts to repay overdue creditors. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n03-04779 (App. Bd. July 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-3030, at 3 (App. Bd. April 2004) \n(quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020, at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 2001) \nSimply because Applicant\u2019s medical (six in all) and consumer (five altogether) \ndebts no longer appear on Applicant\u2019s latest credit report, they cannot be credited as \nvoluntarily paid or otherwise resolved. Debts removed from an applicant\u2019s credit report \nrequire independent evidence of voluntary, good-faith payment efforts for debt \nresolution credit. To date, Applicant has not provided any evidence of good-faith \npayments of these debts. \nPersonal conduct concerns \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions of her failure to \npay federal income taxes over the course of the previous seven years and her failure to \ndisclose her tax delinquencies during her September 2018 PSI. None of Applicant\u2019s \nomissions of her past federal tax delinquencies were voluntarily corrected by Applicant \nbefore her hearing. \nApplicable DCs are \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification \nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or \naward fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d and 16(b), \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading \ninformation; or concealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health professional \ninvolved in making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s \nsituation. \nBased on the evidence presented, none of the mitigating conditions apply to the \nfacts of Applicant\u2019s case. Providing false information in her e-QIP about the status of her \nfederal taxes and failing to provide prompt, good faith corrections and clarifications to \nthe OPM investigator who interviewed her in September 2018, not only impaired the \nDoD\u2019s ability to ascertain Applicant\u2019s past and current financial condition, but revealed \nserious lapses of candor and judgment by Applicant. Implicit in Applicant\u2019s failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers in her e-QIP and PSI investigator about her past \nand current tax delinquencies was a lack of material cooperation with Government \ninvestigators during a national investigative process. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n                   \n \n                 \n                  \n           \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                   \n \n \n        \n \n \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether her finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance. While Applicant is entitled to credit for her work in the defense \nindustry, her efforts are not enough at this time to overcome her failures to resolve her \naccumulated tax, student loan, medical, and consumer debt delinquencies with good-\nfaith initiatives following her return to full-time employment in 2018. Overall \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment have not been established in this \nevidentiary record. \nApplicant\u2019s past and present failures to address and resolve her accumulated \nstudent debt delinquencies reflect adversely on her ability to maintain her finances in a \nsufficiently stable manner to meet the minimum requirements for holding a security \nclearance. Trust concerns are compounded by Applicant\u2019s recurrent lapses in candor \nand judgment evidenced by her omissions of her past and present federal tax \ndelinquencies in her 2019 e-QIP and follow-up PSI. \nBased on a consideration of all of the facts and circumstances considered in this \ncase, it is too soon to make safe predictions that Applicant will be able to voluntarily, or \neven involuntarily, mitigate the Government\u2019s financial and personal conduct concerns \nwithin the foreseeable future. More time is needed for Applicant to establish the \nrequisite levels of stability with her finances and trust in her disclosures of background \ninformation to Government investigators to establish her overall worthiness for holding \na security clearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and\ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations and\npersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.   \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nGuideline F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):  AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.dd: \nAgainst Applicant \n  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n11 \n Guideline E (PERSONAL CONDUCT): \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He explained to the \ngovernment investigator that he was an occasional marijuana user. Once in a while he \nwould have a couple of puffs from a marijuana cigarette being shared among friends at \na party or other social activity. He described his marijuana use as once every four to six \nmonths. Applicant denied using any other illegal drugs. He claimed he stopped using \nmarijuana in March 2017, because he believed nothing good would ever come from it. \nApplicant stated that because of his career obligations he had no intention of ever using \nmarijuana or any other controlled substance in the future.

The case will be adjudicated under the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all \nadjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec.

Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: Excessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness. \nApplicant has a history of alcohol abuse covering the period from 2008 through \nJune 2018. His three DWI arrests (2008, 2012, and 2018) and DWI convictions in 2012 \nand 2018 demonstrate that he has consumed alcohol excessively and to the point of \nimpaired judgment. The record establishes the following disqualifying condition under \nAG \u00b6 22: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder. \nAG \u00b6 23 provides for mitigating conditions that may be applicable to this case: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and the individual has successfully \ncompleted a treatment program along with any required aftercare, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s most recent DWI offense occurred in June 2018, and there is no \nevidence of any subsequent alcohol-related misconduct. After the 2018 DWI, Applicant \nsuccessfully participated in an alcohol counseling-treatment program. There was no \ndiagnosis of alcohol use disorder made. He successfully completed his treatment and \nhis prognosis was considered \u201cexcellent.\u201d In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated \n\u201csobriety has been sustained.\u201d \nI considered that the record evidence shows that Applicant completed his \ntreatment, received a favorable prognosis, his BAC tests were low, and that he has \nbeen sober (no evidence of further alcohol-related misconduct). Notwithstanding, \nApplicant submitted little evidence of his current alcohol consumption, of any permanent \nlifestyle changes made to reduce his alcohol consumption and to prevent any further \nalcohol-related incidents, or of any additional counseling or treatment received. \nConsidering the record as a whole, Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to mitigate the \nalcohol consumption concerns. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern for the illegal use of drugs: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nIn 2007, Applicant was charged with possession of methamphetamine. He was \nconvicted of simple possession of a Schedule II Controlled Substance. Additionally, \nApplicant disclosed in his 2018 SCA that he used marijuana with varying frequency \nbetween 2007 and March 2017. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.  \nThe record established the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c), \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of some of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n   (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n   (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n   (3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and  \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, some of the above mitigating conditions \nare partially applicable to this case, but do not fully mitigate the substance abuse \nconcerns. Applicant was convicted in 2007 for possession of a Schedule II Controlled \nSubstance. He was sentenced to 45 days\u2019 confinement (suspended), 12 months\u2019 \nprobation, to participate in a substance abuse assessment and to attend treatment. \nNotwithstanding, Applicant continued to illegally use marijuana, another controlled \nsubstance, between 2007 and 2017. His recalcitrant behavior shows that he learned \nlittle from his 2007 conviction or subsequent substance abuse treatment and \ncounseling. It further demonstrates Applicant\u2019s inability or unwillingness to comply with \nlaws, rules, and regulations.  \nWithout current evidence of abstinence, rehabilitation, disassociation from drug \nusers, permanent lifestyle changes, and a clear intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement, the passage of time alone is insufficient to mitigate the questionable \njudgment associated with his alcohol-related and drug involvement misconduct. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guidelines G and H in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of these factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \nApplicant, 37, has been working for his employer, a federal contractor since \n2018. This is his first clearance application. Applicant did not appear at his hearing and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nsubmitted little favorable information. His sparse evidence is insufficient to demonstrate \na pattern of modified behavior and rehabilitation. The alcohol consumption and drug \ninvolvement security concerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

On February \n16, 2021, the case was assigned to me. On February 26, 2021, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice scheduling the hearing for March 18, \n2021. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled in Arlington, Virginia. \nDepartment Counsel provided two exhibits, which were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection.

(Tr. 21; AE A-AE P) Department Counsel objected to AE F because Applicant\u2019s \nEgyptian birth certificate was not translated to English. (Tr. 15-16) Applicant subsequently \nauthenticated his birth certificate, and it was admitted for the limited purpose of showing \nthe date and place of Applicant\u2019s birth. (Tr. 16, 22-24) On March 25, 2021, Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for administrative notice was received, and the record closed. (Tr. 17, 91) On \nMarch 31, 2021, DOHA received the transcript of the hearing. \nAdministrative Notice \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice concerning Egypt. (Tr. 14; \nHE 4) Applicant did not object to Department Counsel\u2019s request for administrative notice, \nand I granted it. (Tr. 14) On March 25, 2021, Applicant requested administrative notice of \nadditional facts concerning Egypt; there was no objection; and the request was granted. \n(HE 5) \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, \n2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-\n24875 at 2 (App. Bd.

(HE 3) He denied the SOR allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, \n1.o, 1.p, and 1.q. (Id.) He also provided mitigating information. (Id.) \nApplicant is a 50-year-old Egyptian and United States dual citizen who seeks a \nsecurity clearance. (GE 1) He has been employed as a senior engineer for a defense \ncontractor since 2017. (Tr. 18; GE 1 at 13) He has previously held a public trust position. \nHe has also been employed as a consultant from 2010 to the present. (Id. at 14) He has \nexceptional experience as an engineer and held important professional positions with \nmultiple companies in the United States. (AE A) His current annual salary is about \n$160,000 plus bonuses. (Tr. 18) In 1995, he married, and his three children were born in \nthe United States in 1997, 2001, and 2006. (Tr. 21; GE 1 at 26-29) \nForeign Influence \nIn 1970, Applicant was born in Egypt. (GE 1 at 9) From 1987 to 1995, he attended \na university in Egypt; he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1992; and a master\u2019s degree in \n1995. (Id. at 12) In 1995, he immigrated to the United States. (Tr. 44) From 1995 to 2001, \nhe attended a university in the United States. (SCA at 12) In 1997, he received a master\u2019s \ndegree in the United States, and in 2001, he received a Ph.D. in the United States. (Id. at \n13) In 2008, Applicant became a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 48; SCA at 8; GE 2 at 1) He has not \ntaken any action to renounce his Egyptian citizenship. (Id. at 9) From 2004 to present, he \nhas lived in the same residence in the United States. (Id. at 10) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c allege and Applicant admitted his spouse, daughter, and \ntwo sons are dual citizens of Egypt and the United States. (Tr. 29) They reside in the \nUnited States, and most recently went to Egypt in 2019. (Tr. 29, 32, 58) One son and one \ndaughter have Egyptian birth certificates because \u201cit was natural to get them birth \ncertificates where we are citizens, but they never basically used it.\u201d (Tr. 30, 49-50; GE 2 \nat 7) He did not intend to apply for a birth certificate for his third child. (Tr. 50; GE 2 at 7) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e allege and Applicant admitted his mother and two sisters \n(sister one and sister two) are citizens and residents of Egypt, and in 2019 as of the date \nof his SOR response, all three were employed, either active or semi-retired, by an entity \nthat may have a connection to the Egyptian government. (Tr. 30-32; GE 1; GE 2) He did \nnot provide details about the importance of their positions or their likelihood of coming to \nthe government\u2019s attention. (GE 2) At his hearing, he said he is unsure about the \nemployment status of his mother and sisters one and two, and he did not explain why he \nwas no longer aware of their employment status. (Tr. 31-33, 50) He did not know whether \nsisters one and two currently work for the same entity as indicated in the SOR. (Tr. 33) \nHe said because of his \u201cinfrequent\u201d contact with sisters one and two, he cannot be sure \nabout their current employment situation. (Tr. 53-54) In 2017, Applicant communicated \nwith his sisters and his father-in-law on a monthly basis. (GE 1 at 29-34; GE 2 at 7). He \nsporadically communicates with his mother every week or every other week, and with his \nsisters every two to three months.

(Tr. 32-\n33; SOR response) Two of his sisters are married, and he does not know what their \nhusbands currently do for a living. (Tr. 33)  \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i, allege Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law, father-in-law, and \nbrother-in-law are citizens and residents of Egypt, and all three are or were recently \nemployed by the same entity as his two sisters. His mother-in-law passed away, and SOR \n\u00b6 1.g is mitigated. (Tr. 34) His father-in-law is a citizen and resident of Egypt, and as \nrecently as 2019, he was in a semi-retired position with the entity. (Tr. 34; SOR response) \nHe may be receiving a pension from the Egyptian government or the entity that employed \nhim. Applicant said at his hearing that he is unaware of his father-in-law\u2019s current \nemployment. (Tr. 34) He most recently spoke to his father-in-law about three months ago, \nand he usually speaks to his father-in-law about every six months.

(Tr. 35, 55; GE 2 at 11) He speaks to his brother-in-law about every six \nmonths when he talks to his sister. (Tr. 36, 55) Applicant\u2019s third sister who formerly lived \nin Kuwait is a stay-at-home mother. (Tr. 55) He did not know about her husband\u2019s \nemployment. (Tr. 56) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k allege and Applicant admits he has five nieces and four \nnephews who are citizens and residents of Egypt. (Tr. 36-37) About the only time he has \ncontact with them is when he visits Egypt. (Tr. 36) His nieces and nephews are children, \nteenagers, and/or students. (Tr. 37) \nApplicant visited Egypt as follows: 2009 (one visit for 11-20 days); 2010 (11-20 \ndays); 2011 (three visits for 11-20 days, 6-10 days, and 11-20 days); 2012 (one visit for \n11-20 days); 2013 (two visits for 6-10 days and 11-20 days); 2014 (one visit for 11-20 \ndays); 2015 (one visit for 11-20 days); 2016 (one visit for 11-20 days); 2017 (one visit for \n17 days), and 2019 (one visit for 11-20 days). (Tr. 52, 68; SCA at 43-60; GE 2 at 13) For \nall of his trips to Egypt, he traveled with his wife and children, except for his trips in 2011 \n(twice) and 2013 (once). (Tr. 32, 58; GE 2 at 10) During his visits to Egypt, he usually \nvisited his mother, sisters, father-in-law, brother-in-law, and nieces. (Tr. 32, 35-36, 57) \nApplicant said he travels to Egypt about every two years. (Tr. 57) \nApplicant\u2019s spouse was born in Egypt in 1971. (GE 1 at 22) Applicant met her in \nEgypt. (Tr. 47) She became a U.S. citizen around 2007. (Tr. 49) He and his spouse\u2019s total \nU.S. annual income is about $290,000. (Tr. 25) His spouse has resided in the United \nStates for 26 years. (Tr. 20) In response to a question about his spouse\u2019s contacts with \nher father, Applicant said, \u201cProbably she calls him, but I don\u2019t know.\u201d (Tr. 56) She is a \nsuccessful professional who owns her own business. (Tr. 19) Her equity in the building \nwhere her office is located is $210,000.

(Tr. 25-27, 64) \nFinancial Connections to Egypt \nSOR \u00b6 1.l alleges Applicant owns an apartment in Egypt valued at about $80,000. \nHis mother lives in it, and he said he did not \u201cactually control it or own it.\u201d (Tr. 37, 51, 67) \nHis mother controls the property. (Tr. 68) He said the estimated value could be $1,000, \n$50,000, or $80,000 and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator just put \nthe highest number they heard in their report. (Tr. 37) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.n allege and Applicant admits he has two bank accounts in \nEgypt with a total of about $87,000 in them. (Tr. 38-40, 68-69; SCA at 37) The amounts \nin the accounts vary depending on his visits to Egypt and his investments. He has \ntransferred funds through his Egyptian accounts to the United States. (Tr. 39) \nSOR \u00b6 1.o alleges and Applicant admits he inherited a share of a building in Egypt \nvalued at about $330,000. (Tr. 41, 69-70; GE 2 at 9) Applicant disputed the valuation of \nthe building, and said he only had a one-eighth share. He explained that because of old \nrental laws that prevent him from selling the building, the value is actually zero. (Tr. 41) \nThe cost to maintain the property exceeds the rent received from the tenants. (Tr. 41) He \ndid not even know the location of the building, and it is not in his name. (Tr. 70-71) \nSOR \u00b6 1.p alleges Applicant is eligible to receive retirement benefits from an \nEgyptian employer valued at about $10,000. Applicant worked for the same Egyptian \nentity from 1992 to 1995 that employs or employed his sisters. (Tr. 42-43) He was on a \nleave of absence from this Egyptian employment from 1995 until 2014. (SCA at 42) He \npreviously indicated he expected to receive retirement from this Egyptian employer of \nabout $10,000. (SCA at 39; GE 2 at 8) He would be eligible for the retirement benefit at \nage 60. (Tr. 73) At his hearing, he said he expects not to apply for any Egyptian retirement \nbecause the amount received would be too low for him to make an effort to collect. (Tr. \n42-43, 72) \nSOR \u00b6 1.q alleges that from 2015 to 2017, Applicant contributed about 25 percent \nof the total investment or about $8,000 to purchase an apartment in Egypt. (HE 2) He \nagreed that he made the investment; however, he sold his share in 2017 or 2018. (Tr. 43, \n63; HE 3; SCA at 38, 40-41) \nIn sum at most, Applicant\u2019s investments in Egypt total $80,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.l) + \n$87,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m & 1.n) + $41,625 (SOR \u00b6 1.o (1/8 X $333,000)) + $10,000 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.p) = $218,625. Applicant disputed the SOR\u2019s valuation of several of these investments, \nand he concluded his Egyptian investments are less than ten percent and possibly less \nthan five percent of the net worth for all of his investments in the United States. (Tr. 28, \n39) He does not intend to retire in Egypt. (Tr. 28)   \nApplicant said he does not vote in Egyptian elections, and he votes in U.S. \nelections.

(Tr. 60) He was \nunaware of financial connections between the Egyptian government and the entity \nemploying his sisters in 2019 when he completed his response to the SOR. (Tr. 62; SOR \nresponse) Applicant was previously employed by the same entity in Egypt that employed \nhis sisters. (GE 2) He and his spouse do not have any siblings or close relatives living in \nthe United States other than those previously discussed. (Tr. 74-75) Applicant is willing \nto renounce his Egyptian citizenship. (Tr. 78; GE 2 at 11) If his family in Egypt were \nthreatened by terrorists or criminals to obtain classified information from Applicant, he \nwould report to security any attempt to coerce him for information. (Tr. 79) The United \nStates is his home, and he promised to continue to faithfully serve the United States. (Tr. \n80) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant\u2019s manager has known Applicant for four years and worked with him on \na daily basis for three years.

He is \ntalented, diligent, ethical, trustworthy, and responsible. (Id.) His performance evaluations \nindicated: achieved, exceptional performance, excellent performance, complies with \nstandards, or successful performance in all areas.

He presented a certificate showing his efforts to enhance his knowledge and skills. \n(AE E) His employer gave him a technical recognition award in 2020. (Id.) \nEgypt \nEgypt and the United States belong to a number of the same international \norganizations, including the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, \nand World Trade Organization. Egypt is a Partner for Cooperation with the Organization \nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe, an observer to the Organization of American \nStates, a partner in the NATO Mediterranean Dialogue, and a non-party state to the \nInternational Criminal Court. Cairo hosts the headquarters of the League of Arab States. \nThe United States established diplomatic relations with Egypt in 1922, following its \nindependence from protectorate status under the United Kingdom. The United States and \nEgypt share a strong partnership based on mutual interest in Middle East peace and \nstability, economic opportunity, and regional security. Promoting a stable, prosperous \nEgypt, where the government protects the basic rights of its citizens and fulfills the \naspirations of the Egyptian people, will continue to be a core objective of U.S. policy. \nU.S. assistance to Egypt has long played a central role in Egypt's economic and \nmilitary development and in furthering the strategic partnership and regional stability. \nSince 1978, the United States has provided Egypt with what now totals over $50 billion in \nmilitary and $30 billion in economic assistance. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEgypt and the United States signed a Bilateral Investment Treaty in 1982 to \npromote and facilitate investment between the two countries. Egypt and the United States \nhave signed a trade and investment framework agreement, a step toward creating freer \ntrade and increasing investment flows. American firms are active in most sectors of the \nEgyptian economy, including oil and gas exploration and production, financial services, \nmanufacturing, construction, telecommunications technology, information technology, \nand the restaurant and hospitality industry. Flows of U.S. direct investment to Egypt were \n$1.37 billion in 2019, bringing the accumulated long-term stock of U.S. foreign direct \ninvestment to nearly $24 billion. \nThe U.S. has been largely involved in the Multinational Force & Observers (MFO) \noperation since 1982. The MFO is a peacekeeping operation that supervises and \nmonitors the implementation of the security provisions of the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli Treaty \nof Peace. \nExamples of recent cooperation between the United States and Egypt are as \nfollows: On March 14, 2021, Egyptian ENS SHARM EL-SHEIKH and USS SOMERSET \nperform passing exercise; On February 23, 2021, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken's \ncall with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry occurred; on December 17, 2020, \nUSTDA supported major refinery upgrades in Egypt; on August 24, 2020, the Texas \nNational Guard and Egyptian military began a long-term military partnership; on August \n17, 2020, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo certified that Egypt is sustaining the \nstrategic relationship with the United States and meeting its obligations under the 1979 \nEgypt-Israel Peace Treaty; and on January 8, 2019, an agreement was signed in Cairo \nregarding defense cooperation between the United States and Egypt and entered into \nforce. \nEgypt is a republic governed by an elected president and unicameral legislature. \nPresidential elections were held in March 2018. Prior to the elections, challengers to the \nincumbent President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi withdrew their candidacy, citing personal \ndecisions, political pressure, legal troubles, and unfair competition. Domestic and \ninternational organizations expressed concern that government limitations on \nassociation, assembly, and expression severely constrained broad participation in the \npolitical process. Egypt was under a government declared State of Emergency for all of \n2019, and has been since the April 2017 terrorist attacks on Coptic Churches. \nThe U.S. Department of State travel advisory for Egypt is Level 3: Exercise \nincreased caution due to terrorism and the Embassy's limited ability to assist dual national \nU.S. Egyptian citizens who are arrested or detained. Do not travel to the Sinai Peninsula \n(with the exception of travel to Sharm El-Sheikh by air) or the Western Desert due to \nterrorism, and to the Egyptian border areas due to military zones.

Terrorists may attack with little or no \nwarning, and terrorists have targeted diplomatic facilities, tourist locations, transportation \nhubs, markets, shopping malls, western businesses, restaurants, resorts, and local \ngovernment facilities. Terrorists have conducted attacks in urban areas, including in \nCairo, despite the heavy security presence. Terrorists have targeted religious sites, to \ninclude mosques, churches, monasteries, and buses traveling to these locations. \nThe U.S. Department of State has assessed Cairo as being a critical-threat \nlocation for terrorism directed at or affecting official U.S. Government interests. Several \nterrorist organizations operate in Egypt. The Islamic State-Sinai Province terrorist group \n(also known as Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis (ABM), an ISIS affiliate) is the most active terrorist \ngroup in Egypt; it pledged allegiance to ISIS in 2014. \nMost terrorist attacks in Egypt occur in the Sinai Peninsula and largely targeted \nsecurity forces, but terrorist attacks targeting civilians, tourists, and security personnel in \nmainland Egypt remained a concern. Though early 2019 witnessed a series of improvised \nexplosive device (IED) incidents in greater Cairo, those incidents became more infrequent \nas the year progressed. ISIS-Sinai Province (ISIS-SP) carried out the majority of the total \nattacks in 2019, though it claimed no attacks in mainland Egypt and no attacks against \nWestern interests. ISIS-SP responded to ISIS's call to increase attacks to avenge the \nterrorist group's territorial defeat in Syria in March. There were at least 151 IED-related \nattacks in Egypt in 2019, of which ISIS-SP conducted at least 137 in northern and central \nSinai, along with near-weekly complex assaults on government-fortified positions, \ndemonstrating the terrorist group's freedom to maneuver during daytime hours and \ngeographic expansion of attacks westward, toward the Suez Canal Zone, and southward. \nIn addition, Harakat Sawa'd Misr (HASM) and al-Qa'ida allied groups such as Ansar al-\nIslam are believed to be behind the spate of anti-western attacks in mainland Egypt in \n2019, and they also posed a continued threat. A number of terrorism-related incidents \nwere reported on Egyptian news and on Egyptian social media in 2019, and included \nsmall arms attacks, IEDs, vehicle borne IEDs, kidnappings, executions, complex assaults, \nambushes, and targeted assassinations. \nAccording to the most recent U.S. Department of State Human Rights Report, \nhuman rights issues in Egypt during 2019 included arbitrary or unlawful killings, including \nincidents that occurred while making arrests or holding persons in custody or during \ndisputes with civilians. There were also reports of civilians killed during military operations \nin Sinai. Impunity was a problem. There were instances of persons tortured to death and \nother allegations of killings in prisons and detention centers. The government charged, \nprosecuted, and convicted perpetrators in some cases. A local human rights \nnongovernmental organization (NGO) reported 302 unlawful killings by the government \nfrom January through June. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfacts.

They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \nin this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nApplicant has the following Egyptian family connections: (1) his spouse and three \nchildren are dual citizens of the United States and Egypt, and residents of the United \nStates; (2) his mother and two sisters are citizens and residents of Egypt; (3) his father-\n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nin-law and brother-in-law are citizens and residents of Egypt; and (4) his mother, two \nsisters, father-in-law, and brother-in-law are or were employed by an entity with possible \nconnection to the Egyptian government. \nAt most, Applicant\u2019s investments in Egypt total $218,625. He disputed the \nmagnitude of several of these investments, and he concluded his Egyptian investments \nare less than ten percent and possibly less than five percent of the net worth for all of his \ninvestments in the United States. \nApplicant did not have sufficient connections with his mother-in-law (she is \ndeceased), five nieces, and four nephews to cause a security concern. His nieces and \nnephews are much younger than Applicant, and he does not communicate with them. He \ncommunicates with their parents. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.j, and 1.k are refuted. \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of \nnexus is not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. June 13, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \nThe mere possession of close family ties with people living in a foreign country is \nnot, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant, his or \nher spouse, or someone sharing living quarters with them, has such a relationship with \neven one person living in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient to create the \npotential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) (discussing \nproblematic visits of that applicant\u2019s father to Iran). \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws. ISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-00939 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, \n2002)). \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government are \namong the important considerations that provide context for the other record evidence \nand must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. The \ncountry\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-\n02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, 2017)). \nAnother important consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s relationship with \nthe United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an \napplicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to government coercion \nor inducement.  \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law including \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwidely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, terrorism causes a \nsubstantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is known to conduct \nintelligence collection operations against the United States. The relationship of Egypt with \nthe United States and the situations involving terrorists and insurgents in that country \nplace a significant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships \nwith any family member living in or visiting them do not pose a security risk because of \nthe risks due to terrorists in that country. Applicant should not be placed into a position \nwhere he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and concerns \nabout assisting someone living in or visiting Egypt. \nThe Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-24933, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 346 at *20-*21 \nn. 18 (App. Bd. July 28, 2005), explained how relatives in a foreign country have a security \nsignificance: \nThe issue under Guideline B is not whether an applicant\u2019s immediate family \nmembers in a foreign country are of interest to a foreign power based on \ntheir prominence or personal situation. Rather, the issue is whether an \napplicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate family members in a foreign \ncountry raise security concerns because those ties and contacts create a \npotential vulnerability that a foreign power, [criminals, or terrorists] could \nseek to exploit in an effort to get unauthorized access to U.S. classified \ninformation that an applicant \n-- not the applicant\u2019s immediate family \nmembers -- has by virtue of a security clearance. A person may be \nvulnerable to influence or pressure exerted on, or through, the person\u2019s \nimmediate family members -- regardless of whether the person\u2019s family \nmembers are prominent or not. \nGuideline B security concerns are not limited to countries hostile to the United \nStates. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding \nclassified information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to \nhave access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests \ninimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, \n2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR Case No. 02-22461, \n2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-\n26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd.

International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence \nactivities as effectively as capable state intelligence services, and Egypt has a significant \nproblem with terrorism and crime.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n7(a), 7(b), and 7(f) apply, and further inquiry is necessary about potential application of \nany mitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \n \nwhich \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation; \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nAs indicated in the disqualifying conditions Foreign Influence section, supra, \nApplicant and his spouse have several relatives who are citizens and residents of Egypt. \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe has frequent contacts with several of them.

ISCR Case No. 14-05986 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Oct. 14, 2016). See also ISCR Case No. 04-09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

Frequency of contact is not the \nsole determinant of foreign interest security concerns. \u201c[I]nfrequency of contact is not \nnecessarily enough to rebut the presumption an applicant has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her own immediate family as well as his or her spouse\u2019s immediate \nfamily.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-01979 at 4 (App. Bd. July 31, 2019). \nIn 2017, Applicant communicated with his sisters and father-in-law on a monthly \nbasis. In 2021, he communicated with his mother every week or every other week, and \nwith his sisters every two to three months. He most recently spoke to his father-in-law \nabout three months ago, and in 2021, he usually speaks to his father-in-law about every \nsix months. He speaks to his brother-in-law about every six months when he talks to his \nsister. He did not know how frequently his spouse communicates with her father. His \ncommunication with his brother-in-law is infrequent, and SOR \u00b6 1.i is mitigated. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR does not allege that Applicant frequently traveled to Egypt. In ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five \ncircumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered, stating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;  \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3. \n \n \n \n \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)).

The non-SOR allegation will not be \nconsidered except for the five purposes listed above. His voting in the Egyptian election \nin 2014 is insignificant in comparison to the frequency and recency of his votes in U.S. \nelections. \nIt is important to be mindful of the United States\u2019 historical investments in Egypt. \nEgypt is an important U.S. ally in combatting terrorism, and Egypt has been a leading \nrecipient of U.S. assistance, receiving tens of billions of dollars in aid. Peace between \nEgypt and Israel and stability in Egypt are key to maintenance of peace in the Middle \nEast. \n14 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nA key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d His relationship with the United States must be \nweighed against the potential conflict of interest created by his relationships with relatives \nwho are citizens and residents of Egypt. Applicant and his spouse have lived in the United \nStates for 26 years. In 2007, she became a U.S. citizen, and in 2008, he became a U.S. \ncitizen. He received a master\u2019s degree and a Ph.D. in the United States. He has excellent \nemployment, contributes to the success of his employer, his wife is a successful \nprofessional, they have substantial income and investments in the United States, and his \nspouse and children are U.S. citizens. These factors are balanced against his and his \nspouse\u2019s close relationships with family in Egypt, and their relatives in Egypt are at risk \nfrom criminals, terrorists, and human rights violations of the Egyptian government. \nApplicant\u2019s access to classified information could add significant risk to his relatives living \nin those countries. \nAt most, Applicant\u2019s investments in Egypt total $218,625. His and his spouse\u2019s \nU.S. investments and retirement accounts total $2,490,000. He and his spouse\u2019s total \nU.S. annual income is about $290,000. The value of his Egyptian financial and property \ninterests are less than ten percent of his U.S. financial and property interests. As such, \nhis Egyptian financial and property interests are unlikely to result in a conflict and could \nnot be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure Applicant. See ISCR Case \nNo. 17-01979 at 3-6 (App. Bd. July 31, 2019) (noting the ratio of Egyptian property to U.S. \nproperty is \u201cover 9 percent\u201d but not citing assets in Egypt as a basis to reverse grant of \nsecurity clearance).  AG \u00b6 8.f applies and mitigates SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l through 1.q.  \nApplicant is close to his mother, two sisters, and his father-in-law. The last known \ninformation Applicant provided was that they were all either semi-retired or employed by \nan entity with possible connection to the Egyptian government. Those who are semi-\nretired may be receiving retirement pensions. Applicant did not present any evidence of \nthe position\u2019s lack of a possible connection to the Egyptian government. In ISCR Case \nNo. 17-01979 at 5 (App. Bd. July 31, 2019), the Appeal Board reversed the grant of a \nsecurity clearance where an applicant\u2019s relatives were employed or retired from \nemployment in the Egyptian government, and the Appeal Board said: \nIn the past, we have recognized that an applicant\u2019s ties, either directly or \nthrough a family member, to persons of high rank in a foreign government \nor military are of particular concern, insofar as it is foreseeable that through \nan association with such persons the applicant could come to the attention \nof those interested in acquiring U.S. protected information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 08-10025 at 2 and 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009) (Applicant\u2019s brother \nwas a high-level foreign government official); ISCR Case No.11-04980 at 2 \nand 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2012) (Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law was married to a \nretired high-ranking official in a foreign army); and ISCR Case No. 11-12632 \nat 2 and 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 2, 2015) (Applicant\u2019s niece was an employee of a \nhigh-ranking foreign government official). Given the facts in this case, it is \nforeseeable that the high-level governmental position of Applicant\u2019s sibling \ncould become a means through which parties could attempt to exert \npressure on him.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n15 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to his relatives residing in Egypt who are or were \nemployed by an entity with a possible connection to the Egyptian government are too \nsignificant to mitigate without a more detailed showing of their lack of significance to the \nEgyptian government. His connections to the United States, taken together, are \ninsufficient to overcome the foreign influence security concerns under Guideline B. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline B are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 50-year-old Egyptian and United States dual citizen who seeks a \nsecurity clearance. He has been employed as a senior engineer for a defense contractor \nsince 2017, and as a consultant from 2010 to the present. He has exceptional experience \nas an engineer and held important professional positions with multiple companies in the \nUnited States. In 1995, he married, and his three children were born in 1997, 2001, and \n2006 in the United States. Applicant and his spouse immigrated to the United States in \n1995, and he became a U.S. citizen in 2008. His spouse became a U.S. citizen in 2007. \nHe and his spouse have accumulated substantial investments in the United States. They \nhave significant annual U.S. incomes. \nApplicant\u2019s manager described Applicant as a model employee who is respected \nfor his knowledge, professionalism, and commitment to excellence. He is talented, \ndiligent, ethical, trustworthy, and responsible. His performance evaluations show \nexcellent performance and contributions to his employer. He received a certificate \nshowing his efforts to enhance his knowledge and skills and a technical recognition \naward. \nA Guideline B decision concerning Egypt must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation and dangers in that country.

May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient discussion of geopolitical \nsituation and suggesting expansion of whole-person discussion). Egypt is a dangerous \nplace because of violence from terrorists, and the Egyptian government does not respect \nthe full spectrum of human rights. Terrorists continue to threaten the Egyptian \ngovernment, the interests of the United States, and those who cooperate and assist the \nUnited States. The United States and Egypt are allies in the war on terrorism and \ncooperate in many areas. \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive. From 2009 to 2021, Applicant \ntraveled to Egypt 13 times. He and/or his spouse are close to his mother, two sisters, and \nhis father-in-law. The four relatives are citizens and residents of Egypt. Applicant, his \nspouse, and three children are dual citizens of the United States and Egypt. The four \nrelatives are retired or semi-retired from positions with an entity with possible connections \nto the Egyptian government. Applicant did not present evidence of the lack of connection \nbetween the entity employing them or providing retirement benefits to them, and the \nEgyptian government. The entity may be part of or under the control of the Egyptian \ngovernment. The Egyptian government may closely monitor the activities of some \nemployees of the entity. Applicant did not meet his burden of showing that his and his \nspouse\u2019s associations with his relatives in Egypt are unlikely to come to the attention of \nthose interested in acquiring U.S. classified information. \u201cApplication of the guidelines is \nnot a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people \nmay act in unpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a loved \none, such as a family member.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-01979 at 5 (App. Bd.

I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec.

Applicant admitted that she did not file federal and state tax returns for 2016, 2017, and 2018 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.b). She filed the tax returns in December 2020. (Response to FORM at 11) By asserting the statute of limitations, she claimed that she was no longer responsible for the delinquent auto debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) that was in a collection status in August 2020, the month the SOR was published. Applicant is 54 years old and has been divorced since 1991. She has a 32\u00ad year-old son. She has owned her home since 2002. Her 32-year-old son currently lives in the dwelling. She lives in an apartment. She recently helped her parents purchase their home located in a safer area of the town where they reside. This is Applicant\u2019s first application for a security clearance.

This \ncase is adjudicated in accordance with Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) dated \nJune 8, 2017. \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR is undated. In view of her statement at the \nbottom of the first page of her answer, which indicates that she provided documentary \nevidence showing that she filed all tax returns, it logically follows that she submitted her \nSOR response after December 2020, the date posted on the US Post Office receipt \nlocated in her response to the FORM. See April 2021 Response to FORM at 11. \nThe Government sent a copy of the Government\u2019s File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM), the Government\u2019s evidence in support of the allegations of the SOR, \nto Applicant on February 12, 2021. Applicant received the FORM on March 5, 2021. \nThe FORM recommended she file objections, submit additional information or provide \nexplanations within 30 days of receiving the FORM. On April 2, 2021, Applicant \nsubmitted a 24-page response to the FORM, which DOHA received on April 14, 2021, \nand is now in evidence. I was assigned the case on May 17, 2021. \nRulings on Evidence \nUnder the Evidence section of the FORM (page 2), the Government advised \nApplicant that she could make corrections to the April 1, 2019 personal security \ninterview (PSI) to improve the exhibit\u2019s clarity and accuracy. Alternatively, Applicant was \nadvised that if she objected to the entire PSI on the ground that it was unauthenticated \nby a government witness, it would not be entered into evidence. Applicant did not \nobject, and the exhibit is admitted into evidence. See, E3.1.20. of DOD Directive \n5200.6, page 52. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges three delinquent debts. Applicant admitted that she did not file \nfederal and state tax returns for 2016, 2017, and 2018 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.b). She filed \nthe tax returns in December 2020. (Response to FORM at 11) By asserting the statute \nof limitations, she claimed that she was no longer responsible for the delinquent auto \ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) that was in a collection status in August 2020, the month the SOR was \npublished. \nApplicant is 54 years old and has been divorced since 1991. She has a 32\u00ad\nyear-old son. She has owned her home since 2002. Her 32-year-old son currently lives \nin the dwelling. She lives in an apartment. She recently helped her parents purchase \ntheir home located in a safer area of the town where they reside. This is Applicant\u2019s first \napplication for a security clearance.

(Item 7 at 1) In her previous employment, she worked in \na job shop at a trade school, as a document control clerk, and she also worked as a \nparts assembler. Her employment record indicates that since March 2009, she was \nunemployed four times for varying lengths of time, not exceeding 15 months. No \nadditional information was provided for the major surgery that she mentioned she had in \n2014. (Item 3 at 11-23) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1b. \u2013 In her December 2018 security clearance application, \nApplicant disclosed that she had not filed her federal and state tax returns for 2016 and \n2017. Before those two years, she had always filed her own taxes. However, she stated \nthat in 2016, she was living in one state and working in another state. She was \nuncertain about what she should do to file her federal and state taxes. Then she let time \nslip away. She attributed her failure to file the 2017 federal and state tax returns to \ncarelessness and neglect. She intended to file the returns after she filed the security \nclearance application in December 2018. She noted that she never received financial \ncounseling. (Item 3 at 38-39, 41; Item 7 at 2) \nIn her April 2019 PSI, Applicant cited the \u201cliving in one state and working in \nanother state explanation\u201d as the only reason she did not file the 2016 and 2017 federal \nand state tax returns. She revealed that she was getting help from a friend to file her \nreturns. In her responses to interrogatories filed on January 27, 2020, Applicant \nindicated again that she had not filed her federal and state tax returns. She noted that \nshe was in the process of completing the returns. Applicant filed the missing tax returns \nin December 2020. (Item 4 at 1-8; Item 7 at 2-3; Response to FORM at 1, 11-24) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 This is an installment finance loan account for a car that was \nopened in August 2010. The $5,166 account became delinquent and charged off in \nOctober 2015. In Applicant\u2019s April 2019 PSI, she indicated that she was in the process \nof making payment arrangements with the creditor to settle the SOR \u00b6 1.c debt for the \ncar that was repossessed. Although she was offered an opportunity during and after the \nPSI to provide additional information about the car and other debts, Applicant did not \nprovide any information. (Item 7 at 2-3; Response to FORM at 1) \nOn October 16, 2020, Applicant requested an application for a student loan \nrepayment plan (unlisted delinquent debt). On March 15, 2020, the government service \nprovider congratulated Applicant for successfully completing her first year (2019) in the \nforgiveness program. (Response to FORM at 4-9) \nOn December 4, 2020, Applicant provided documentation showing she paid \n$32.20 for filing tax returns to the Federal Government, the state where she resides \n(State #1), and the state where she works (State #2). The returns were filed for the \nyears listed in the SOR and tax years 2019 and 2020. She did not know that not filing \nher tax returns was a crime.

On April 2, 2021, Applicant paid State #2 $1,337 for tax years 2017, \n2018, and 2019. On December 31, 2020, State #2 informed Applicant that her refund \nrequest for tax year 2016 was denied because the request was outside the three-year \nlimitation period and the period for an extension in which to file a return had expired. \n(Response to FORM at 16-22) \nOn February 5, 2021, State #1 informed Applicant that she owes $2,015 for tax \nyear 2019. The state also informed her that she owes $3,397 for tax year 2017. \n(Response to FORM at 23-24) \nPolicies \nThe objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense \nassessment of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is \neligible for a security clearance. The adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a \nnumber of variables referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, viewing a person by the \ntotality of his or her acts, omissions, motivations and various other variables. Each case \nmust be evaluated on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant \ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. In \nall adjudications, the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. \nTherefore, any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation is resolved in favor of national security. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18: Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nThe disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 are: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nIn Applicant\u2019s December 2018 e-QIP, her April 2019 PSI, her January \n2020 answers to interrogatories, and her answer to the August 2020 SOR, \nApplicant admitted she did not file her federal and state tax returns for tax years \n2016, 2017, and 2018 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). Her failure to file federal and state \ntax returns meet the elements of disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 19(f). The \nexistence of the repossessed car debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c), which has been delinquent \nsince 2015, falls within the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c). \nThe five conditions under AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate security concerns \ninclude: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has exercised some good judgment by finally filing her tax returns. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies in part because she filed all her federal and state tax returns for tax \nyears 2016, 2017, and 2018. And, she has paid a significant amount of back taxes. \nHowever, she did not file the returns until December 2020, about two years after she \nfirst stated her intention to file the tax returns. \nWhen Applicant submitted her e-QIP in December 2018, she claimed that she \ndid not file for tax year 2016 because she was confused about how to file returns while \nliving in State #1 and working in State #2. Also, she let time lapse. Her explanation for \nnot filing for tax year 2017 was carelessness and neglect. Apparently, she was no \nlonger confused about how to file, but just did not file because of procrastination. \nHowever, she presented no documentation to prove what she actually did towards filing \nthe tax returns in December 2018. \nIn her April 2019 PSI, Applicant acknowledged that she had not filed her tax \nreturns, but was receiving assistance in filing the returns. She also stated that she was \nactively trying to arrange payments with the SOR \u00b6 1(c) creditor. For a second time, she \nprovided no documented proof of exactly what she did towards processing her tax \nreturns and paying of the car debt. In January 2020, Applicant again conceded that the \ntax returns had not been filed. She again stated that she was in the process of filing the \nreturns. In her answers to the August 2020 SOR, she admitted that the tax returns were \nnot filed by August 2020, the date of the SOR, but were filed in December 2020. \nEven though the failure to file a federal tax return is a federal offense under \nTitle 26 U.S.C \u00a7 7203, I am not considering Applicant\u2019s failure to file a federal crime. \nRather, DOHA Appeal Board precedent has held that an applicant\u2019s repeated failure to \nsatisfy her legal obligation to file federal and state tax returns does not demonstrate the \ngood judgment and reliability required by persons seeking access to classified \ninformation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) \nThe timing of an applicant\u2019s actions in resolving his or her financial \nindebtedness is meaningful in assessing her case in mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(g). When \nan applicant waits until after being placed on notice that she is at risk of losing her \nsecurity clearance, she may lack the judgment to follow rules and regulations \nconsistently or when there is no urgent threat to her own objectives. Applicant\u2019s failure \nto file her federal and state returns until after submitting her e-QIP, her PSI, and her \nanswers to interrogatories, diminishes the weight her filing would otherwise deserve. \nApplicant\u2019s four periods of unemployment since March 2009, and her \nunexplained surgery in 2014 were conditions beyond her control entitling her to some \nmitigation under the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b). However, the mitigation she receives is \nsubstantially weakened by her continuous employment since April 2016 and her failure \nto act on the tax returns for two years. Applicant receives minimal mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n20(d) for the same reasons explained under AG \u00b6 20(c). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe reasons supplied by Applicant for not filing her federal and state tax returns \nin a timely fashion are unconvincing. Under the circumstances, her evidence does not \nestablish sufficient mitigation under the guideline for financial considerations. \nDocumentary evidence of financial counseling can provide probative insight into \nhow an applicant handles her finances. An applicant\u2019s use of a budget to monitor her \nincome and expenses can be persuasive evidence of action of her determination to live \nwithin her means. On the other hand, contributing to the purchase of her parents\u2019 home, \nhaving to pay rent for her own apartment, and probably sharing expenses for the \nupkeep of the home she has owned since 2002, does not infer that she is living within \nher means. Though Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM tends to show she is gaining \ncontrol of her tax and other debt issues, only limited mitigation is available under AG \u00b6 \n20(c) for Applicant because she has not had financial counseling. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nappellant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the appellant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions of the \nfinancial considerations guideline. I have also considered the facts and circumstances in \nthe context of the nine factors or the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 54 years old and divorced. She has a 32-year old son. Since April \n2016 to the present, she has worked for her employer as a sub-contractor or directly on \nthe employer\u2019s staff. Though she provided no character evidence, it is fair to infer that \nher job performance with her current employer has probably been satisfactory since she \nwas placed on her current employer\u2019s staff in 2017. \nBased on a lack of mitigating evidence in critical areas of this case, I find \nagainst Applicant under the financial guideline. She knew in December 2018, and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nprobably before that time, that she had not filed the tax returns at issue. While she may \nnot have known that not filing returns was a crime, she had always filed her returns \nbefore 2016. Her confusion over living in one state and working in a coterminous state \ncould have easily been resolved by asking her facility security officer (FSO) or the large \nnumber of individuals living in the region and facing the same circumstances of residing \nin one state and living in another state. Applicant\u2019s carelessness and negligence \nexplanations are pretexts for procrastination. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to act on her tax problems and the car debt until after \nsubmission of her security application, after her PSI, after her responses to \ninterrogatories, and after she received the SOR, raise continuing security concerns \nabout her judgment and reliability. Judging by the totality of all the evidence, Applicant\u2019s \nevidence does not mitigate the security concerns that remain under the guideline for \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFinancial Considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c:   \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without \nobjection. I kept the record open until July 31, 2021, to enable him to submit additional \ndocumentary evidence. He timely submitted AX B through H. (AX H duplicates AX A.) \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 19, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, \n1.e, and 2.a-2.l. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact. \nBackground Information \nApplicant is a 53-year-old senior military analyst employed by various federal \ncontractors since August 2008. He has worked for his current employer since April 2019. \n(Tr. 16.) He received a security clearance in April 2008. \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from September 1986 to \nSeptember 1994 and from July 1996 to July 2008. He retired as a chief petty officer (pay \ngrade E-7). \nApplicant married in February 1984, divorced in July 2008, married in August 2012, \nand separated in July 2020. He and his wife intend to divorce. (Tr. 15.) He has a 20-year-\nold son child and three stepchildren, ages 21, 18, and 15. He earned an associate\u2019s \ndegree in 2019. (Tr. 17.) \nAlcohol Consumption (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.3) \nIn March 1990, Applicant was charged with driving under the influence and \nreckless driving. During an interview with a security investigator in October 2017, he told \nthe investigator that he had consumed 4-5 beers and that he failed a field sobriety test \nafter he was stopped by police. He was convicted of reckless driving, fined, and required \nto complete an alcohol safety action program. (GX 2 at 13.) \nIn 2013, Applicant found himself in a stressful marriage, living with a teenager, a \npreteen, and his mother-in-law. He started to increase his alcohol consumption to a \ncouple of 16-ounce cans of beer and a half pint of alcohol every other day, and then his \nalcohol consumption \u201cgot out of hand.\u201d (Tr. 22, 38-39.) He began drinking 4-6 beers daily, \nwith a slight increase on weekends.

He told the psychiatrist that he was consuming ten or more \ndrinks four or more times per week, and that he used alcohol to help him sleep. In June \n2014, the psychiatrist diagnosed him with an anxiety disorder, alcohol dependence, and \nnicotine dependence. The psychiatrist prescribed Naltrexone for his alcohol dependence. \nApplicant testified that he disagreed with the VA psychiatrist\u2019s diagnosis of alcohol \ndependence, because he needed help coping with stress and not help with controlling his \nalcohol consumption. (Tr. 22-23.) Starting in June 2014, he abstained from alcohol for \nabout 18 months while using the Naltrexone. He testified that he stopped drinking \nbecause he wanted to and not because he had to. (Tr. 21.) In 2016, he resumed social \nalcohol consumption, limiting his consumption to one or two beers, and then he stopped \ndrinking again from early 2018 until the end of 2019. (Tr. 29.) \nIn January 2020, Applicant had a violent confrontation with an intoxicated friend. \nAfter the incident, he felt threatened by his former friend and started to carry a firearm \nwith him at home. Applicant\u2019s wife was concerned about his behavior and asked him to \nleave their home for two-weeks. \nLater in January 2020, Applicant met with his primary-care physician. During this \nvisit, he told the physician that his wife had asked him to leave the home, and that he felt \nstressed because his wife did not respect him. (Tr. 30.) He told the physician that he \nusually consumed one or two beers four times a week. However, he also disclosed that \nhe had consumed 28 drinks during the preceding week and had five incidents of binge \ndrinking during the preceding month. His physician advised him to abstain from alcohol. \n(Tr. 34; GX 4 at 3-4, 8.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted that he continued to drink beer \u201cor something\u201d \nat social occasions, notwithstanding his physician\u2019s advice to abstain from alcohol. He \nprefers non-alcoholic beer, and he described his present alcohol consumption as \n\u201cminimal.\u201d He does not believe he has an alcohol problem. (Tr. 37-38.) \nIn February 2020, Applicant consulted with a VA psychiatrist regarding issues \nunrelated to alcohol use and was prescribed an anti-anxiety medication. The psychiatrist \nadvised him to avoid using alcohol or other drugs while taking the anti-anxiety medication. \n(GX 4 at 4.) Applicant testified that he did not consume alcohol while taking the anti-\nanxiety medication. (Tr. 44.) He continued to visit the psychiatrist on a monthly basis until \nJune 2020. (Tr. 35.) \nIn March 2020, Applicant was evaluated by a psychologist at the CAF\u2019s request. \nHe was diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder and moderate alcohol-use \ndisorder. The psychologist noted that Applicant\u2019s current alcohol use (about eight beers \nper week) was not above the guidelines for use of alcohol, but that he also had five recent \nincidents of binge drinking and had exhibited poor judgment by carrying a firearm at home. \nShe noted that Applicant was compliant with his medication programs and enjoyed \nprevious therapy.

Both occurred when his \nemployers were unable to obtain or retain government contracts. (GX 1 at 11-15.) \nDuring an interview with a security investigator in October 2017, Applicant \nvoluntarily disclosed that he had not filed his federal and state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2014, 2015, and 2016. He did not file his returns because he could not afford to \npay the amounts he believed owed for federal and state taxes. (GX 2 at 15.) \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories in May 2020, Applicant submitted federal \nincome tax transcripts reflecting that he had not timely filed his federal returns for tax \nyears 2012 through 2019. (GX 2 at 27-34.) In his narrative response to the inquiries, he \nstated that he had filed his federal returns for tax years 2012 through 2019; that he owed \nnothing for tax years 2012 through 2014; and that he owed $87 for 2015; $5,032 for 2016; \n$176 for 2017; and $2,520 for 2018. He did not indicate whether he thought he owed \ntaxes for 2019. He did not respond to the question asking whether he had filed his state \ntax returns for the same years, but he disclosed that he owned $619 for 2017; $1,076 for \n2018; and $1,080 for 2019. (GX 2 at 3-4.) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that he had filed all his federal and \nstate tax returns. In his post-hearing submission, he provided documentary evidence that \nthat his state tax debts for 2017 and 2018 were paid in full in February 2021, and his state \ntax debt for 2019 was paid in full in March 2021. (AX C.) He requested a federal tax \ntranscript for 2017, but the IRS advised him that it could not provide it at that time, \napparently because of an unresolved identity-theft issue. (AX D.) The federal tax \ntranscripts for 2018 and 2019 reflect that the returns for those years were both received \non November 23, 2020, and that Applicant owed $2,520 for 2018 and $2,358 for 2019. \n(AX E; AX F.) \nIn March 2021, Applicant hired a tax-resolution service to assist him in resolving \nhis federal tax debt. (Tr.45; AX G) As of the date the record closed, Applicant had not yet \nnegotiated a payment plan for the past-due federal income taxes. \nFinancial Considerations\u2014Consumer Debts \nSOR \u00b6 2.j.

In his post-hearing submission, Appellant submitted documentary evidence that \nthe debt was resolved in July 2021. (AX B at 1.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.l. The April 2020 credit report reflects a deficiency after repossession of \nan automobile charged off for $11,562. The last payment was in September 2014. The \ncredit report reflects that the debt is disputed. At the hearing, Applicant admitted that the \nautomobile was repossessed after he was 20 days late on a payment. (Tr. 52-53.) He \ndisputed the debt because the lender would not give him an opportunity to make the late \npayment and recover the automobile. (Tr. 57.) The debt is not resolved. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

The evidence does not establish the \nallegation in SOR \u00b6 1.d, because it shows that Applicant complied with the medical advice \nto abstain from alcohol while taking an anti-anxiety medication. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol use or \nwhether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \nAG \u00b6 22(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \nAG \u00b6 22(e): the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \nAG \u00b6 22(f): alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder.  \nAG \u00b6 22(a) is established. Applicant\u2019s arrest for driving under the influence is \nsufficient to establish this disqualifying condition, even though he was found guilty of a \nlesser offense. \nAG \u00b6 22(c) is established.

Applicant was diagnosed with an alcohol-use disorder \nin June 2014 and again in March 2020. \nAG \u00b6 22(e) is established. Applicant abstained while taking Naltrexone in 2014\u00ad\n2015. He complied with medical advice to abstain from alcohol while taking an anti-\nanxiety drug in 2020. However, his primary-care physician advised him to abstain from \nalcohol in January 2020, and he has not followed that advice. \nAG \u00b6 22(f) is established. Applicant was diagnosed with an alcohol-use disorder in \nJune 2014, and he indulged in five episodes of binge drinking shortly before his mental \nevaluation in March 2020. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable. \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \n \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established pattern \nof modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s maladaptive alcohol use was frequent\nand did not occur under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. Although he is no\nlonger in a stressful marriage, his use of alcohol to relieve stress in other circumstances\nis not unlikely. His last maladaptive alcohol use was in early 2020, about 18 months ago,\nbut I am not convinced that sufficient time has passed to mitigate his conduct, because\nhe continues to consume alcohol, contrary to his physician\u2019s advice, and he adamantly\ndenies that he has an alcohol problem.  \nAG \u00b6 23(b) is not established. Applicant has not acknowledged that he has an \nalcohol-related problem. He regularly consults with a psychiatrist to deal with his anxiety \ndisorder, but he has not followed his primary-care physician\u2019s advice to abstain from \nalcohol. \nAG \u00b6 23(d) is not established. Applicant has received counseling and advice \nconcerning his alcohol use, but he has not followed the medical advice to abstain from \nalcohol. \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file, as required, federal income tax \nreturns for 2012 through 2018 (SOR \u00b6 2.a); that he failed to file state income tax returns \nfor 2014 through 2018 (SOR \u00b6 2.b); that he is indebted to the federal government for \nvarious amounts for federal income taxes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c-2.f); and that he is indebted to the \nstate government for various amounts for state income taxes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.g-2.i). It also \nalleges a credit-card account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 2.j); an unspecific collection \naccount (SOR \u00b6 2.k); and a charged-off deficiency on an automobile repossession (SOR \n\u00b6 2.j). \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local\nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income\ntax as required. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are numerous, \nongoing, and were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment and recent \nmarital breakup were conditions largely beyond his control. However, he has not acted \nresponsibly. He did not begin to address his tax delinquencies and his delinquent \nconsumer debts until he was confronted with them and realized that his security clearance \nwas in jeopardy. An applicant who waits until his clearance is in jeopardy before resolving \ndebts may be lacking in the judgment expected of those with access to classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) citing ISCR Case No. 15-\n03208 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2017). \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of financial \ncounseling. He recently hired a tax-resolution service to assist him in resolving his federal \ntax debt, but the debt is unresolved. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant did not act to resolve the debts in SOR \u00b6 \n2.j and 2.k until he knew his security clearance was in jeopardy. He submitted no evidence \nof compliance with the payment agreement he made in November 2020 for the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 2.j. He has taken no action to resolve the debt in SOR \u00b6 2.l. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant disputed the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.l, \nbut he articulated no reasonable basis for the dispute. He admitted that he was 20 days \nlate on a payment and the lender exercised the right of repossession. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established for the state tax debt. Applicant has filed his past-due \nfederal returns, but he has not yet begun to resolve his federal tax debt. Furthermore, his \neventual compliance with his tax obligations does not end the inquiry. A security \nclearance adjudication is not a tax-enforcement procedure. It is an evaluation of an \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. The fact that Applicant has filed his \npast-due returns does not preclude careful consideration of his longstanding prior \nbehavior evidencing irresponsibility. ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G and F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s \n20 years of honorable service in the U.S. Navy and his long service as an employee of \ndefense contractors. Nevertheless, after weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guidelines G and J, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the \nwhole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his \nalcohol consumption, failure to comply with federal and state tax laws, and delinquent \ndebts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c and 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Financial Considerations:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

SOR 1.b \nalleges that Applicant did not file a federal tax return for 2013. He admitted SOR 1.a and \nclaimed he was paying the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $250 a month. He admitted \nSOR 1.b.

He submitted one $250 check addressed \nto the U.S. Treasury, but provided no documentation of the current status of the SOR 1.a \nfederal tax balance.

His subsequent \nstatement that the IRS wanted him to file his 2013 federal tax return (SOR 1.b) before \nthey provide him a payment plan for federal tax year 2016, is more understandable. His \nclaim that his computer stopped working does not justify his failure to file his 2013 federal \ntax return through some other means. (Item 3 at 36-37) \nApplicant claimed that he was making arrangements to pay the delinquent \naccount in SOR 1.c. No additional information was provided regarding the status of the \narrangements. \nIn support of his claim that the collection agency in SOR 1.d was paid in full, \nApplicant provided a $164 debit payment that was posted on December 28, 2020. There \nis no documentation, i.e., cancelled checks, bank ledgers or statements describing a \nrecord of consistent payments, I am unable to accept Applicant\u2019s claim that the account \nwas paid in full. See, Item 5 at 2. \nIn his answer to SOR 1.e, Applicant indicated that the delinquent account he \nowed the insurance company was for a boat that was repossessed. He furnished no \nadditional documentation to describe the current status of the account. \nItem 4 at page 3 verifies the account alleged in SOR 1.f. The joint-installment \nfinance account was opened in 1986. The account payments were $240 a month, and the \naccount was charged off in May 2015. \nApplicant claimed that he was receiving financial counseling and his mortgage \nlender helped him achieve more reasonable mortgage payments. He explained that his \nmortgage was restored to a current status after he sold off some personal property. (Item \n3 at 37-39) Due to the fact that Applicant provided no documented evidence of financial \ncounseling or a budget, it is impossible to determine what his financial management \npractices are and how he intends to resolve the commercial debts, the unpaid taxes, the \nand missing 2013 federal tax return. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision.

Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel \nsecurity concern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, \nsubstance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be \nexplained by known sources of income is also a security concern insofar as \nit may result from criminal activity, including espionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties that is confirmed by the four credit \nreports, and his undated answer to the SOR, which includes his admitted indebtedness \nto the IRS for $30,000 in unpaid federal income taxes for tax year 2016. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n19(c), and 19(f) apply. AG \u00b6 19(b) also applies to the missing 2013 federal tax return \nalleged in SOR 1.b. The passage of eight years without filing the tax return suggests a \ndisqualifying unwillingness to fulfill his legal responsibility of timely filing yearly tax returns. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\n \n \n4 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation,\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control. \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of inaction towards his delinquent debts and unpaid taxes \ncontinues to raise doubt about his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. \nAfter almost 30 years of employment in IT for an insurance company, Applicant\u2019s \njob was outsourced and he was laid off. His unemployment for six months in 2013 was \nclearly a circumstance beyond his control. While he realizes some mitigation because of \nthe unanticipated loss of employment, he provided inadequate evidence to demonstrate \nhe acted reasonably and responsibly to resolve the missing 2013 tax return, the unpaid \ntaxes, and past-due commercial debts. In sum, AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application to the \ncircumstances of this case. Scant mitigation is available to him under AG \u00b6 20(d) for \nsimilar reasons. AG \u00b6 20(g) cannot be applied either because one payment to the IRS in \nmore than four years is insufficient to consider this condition for mitigation. See, SOR 1.a. \nApplicant\u2019s claim that his payment of $164 in December 2020 resolved the SOR 1.d debt \ndoes not have the necessary documentation to show that all payments were made leading \nto the ultimate satisfaction of the debt. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) affords Applicant some mitigation based on his efforts in working with \nthe debt firm and the lender to restore his mortgage to a current status. Conversely, He \nreceives no mitigation for the SOR delinquent debts and unpaid taxes as there is \ninsufficient evidence to confidently conclude those past-due obligations are under control. \n5 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n                           \n \n   \n \n                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for financial considerations in \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 61 years old. He has been married to his second wife since 1986 \nand has six adult children. He served in the USA from 1978 to 1982. After working almost \n30 years for one employer, his job was unexpectedly outsourced, resulting in six months \nof unemployment until January 2014. He exercised good judgment by negotiating lower \nmortgage payments so that he could keep his home. However, he did not pay his 2016 \ntaxes amounting to $30,000. More than eight years have passed without Applicant filing \nhis 2013 federal tax return. He has done little or nothing to resolve the four commercial \ndebts. Having weighed the evidence from a commonsense point of view, Applicant has \nnot overcome the security concerns arising from the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The SOR alleges that the Applicant failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years from 2013 through 2018, and that he is indebted to the Federal government for delinquent taxes for tax years 2014, 2016 and 2017. Applicant admits allegations 1.a. and 1.b. set forth in the SOR. He denies the indebtedness to the Federal government for delinquent taxes in the amounts alleged in the SOR. Applicant began working for his current employer in January 2018. Applicant served in the U.S. Army from 1983 to 2006, before retiring with an honorable discharge. (Government Exhibit 2.) In his answer to the SOR, Applicant explained that he did not file his Federal and state income tax returns in a timely fashion because he was missing supporting documents from 2013 and 2014 to substantiate his deductions.

He has a \nMaster\u2019s degree. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Senior Consultant. He \nis seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR alleges that the Applicant failed to file his Federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax years from 2013 through 2018, and that he is indebted to the Federal \ngovernment for delinquent taxes for tax years 2014, 2016 and 2017. Applicant admits \nallegations 1.a. and 1.b. set forth in the SOR. He denies the indebtedness to the \nFederal government for delinquent taxes in the amounts alleged in the SOR. Applicant \nbegan working for his current employer in January 2018. Applicant served in the U.S. \nArmy from 1983 to 2006, before retiring with an honorable discharge. (Government \nExhibit 2.) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant explained that he did not file his Federal and \nstate income tax returns in a timely fashion because he was missing supporting \ndocuments from 2013 and 2014 to substantiate his deductions. He believed his income \ntax returns could not be filed without this supporting documentation. He states that all \nof his income tax returns in question were filed in April 2020. Applicant has provided \ndocumentary evidence to support this assertion. \n(Government Exhibit 2, and \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \n2 \n \nWith respect to his Federal tax liability, the SOR alleges that Applicant is \nindebted for tax year 2014 in the amount of $25,682.91; tax year 2016 in the amount of \n$22,697.45; and tax year 2017 in the amount of $15,236.09.

Applicant received some refunds and paid off all of the debt he owes, including \nall assessed penalties, interest and fees. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to file his Federal and State income tax returns for tax years \n2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, in a timely fashion. He also failed to pay his \nFederal and state income taxes for 2014, 2016 and 2017. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20; \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;    \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns in a timely fashion \nfor six years, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. \nHe gives no reasonable \nexcuse for his failure to file his income tax returns. His only claim is that he was missing \ndocumentation, but that, in itself, is not sufficient reason to fail to file Federal and state \nincome tax returns for six years. Applicant also failed to pay his taxes during this \nperiod, placing the onus on the IRS to file his income tax returns for him. \nGiven his \nexperience, military background and advanced education, Applicant knew or should \nhave known the legal requirement to file Federal and state annual income tax returns. \nIn this regard, he ignored both Federal and state law. Evidence shows that Applicant \nfinally filed these income tax returns in April 2020. At this time, he also paid the \nrequisite taxes, penalties, interest, and fees associated with his late filings. Applicant\u2019s \nconduct established a long pattern of procrastination, delay, irresponsible behavior, and \nviolations of law that the Federal government takes very seriously. Applicant did not act \nreasonably or responsibly until April 2020. His inaction for so long reflects a pattern of \nunreliability, untrustworthiness, and poor judgment. Accordingly, Applicant does not \nmeet the requirements to access classified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. On an unspecified date, \nApplicant responded to those interrogatories. On September 10, 2020, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DCSA adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nIn an unsworn statement, dated November 17, 2020, Applicant responded to the \nSOR and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A \ncomplete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to \nApplicant by DOHA on December 30, 2020, and he was afforded an opportunity after \nreceipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as \nwell as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM \non January 12, 2021. His response was due on February 11, 2021. Applicant chose not \nto respond to the FORM, for as of March 17, 2021, no response had been received.

Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete \nand thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, \nI make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a network engineer with his current employer since June 2017. He previously worked \nfor various employers in a variety of positions, including systems engineer; desk-side \ntechnician; domain administrator; and network-support technician. A 2004 graduate, he \nearned some college credits, but no degree. He has never served with the U.S. military. \nWhile Applicant claimed in 2018 that he had an active secret clearance, it is unclear when \nthat clearance was granted to him. (Item 5, at 36) Applicant has never been married. He \nhas no children. \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for the tax \nyears 2012, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, essentially claiming that he had anxiety \nand depression and was unable to locate required documentation to timely file those \nincome tax returns. He did not submit medical documentation to reflect the degree of \ndepression and anxiety, or to describe any treatment he may have received to alleviate \nthose conditions. He claimed that he had finally engaged the services of a tax expert, but \nfailed to indicate when that engagement took place. The timeline covering his actions or \ninactions regarding his filings is as follows: \n(2012): The federal income tax return was completed on November 3, 2020 \u2013 \nnearly two months after the SOR was issued \u2013 and the state income tax return, although \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nundated, was reportedly either E-filed or mailed by November 6, 2020.

One is dated November 2, 2020, and the other one is \ndated March 23, 2020. Nevertheless, he claimed that both the federal and state income \ntax returns were completed on November 2, 2020, and were reportedly either E-filed or \nmailed by November 6, 2020. (GE 4, at 1, 11-16; GE 6, at 4, 11-12) \n(2017): The federal income tax return was completed by his tax preparer on March \n23, 2020. He did not submit a copy of his state income tax return. Applicant claimed that \nboth the federal and state income tax returns were reportedly either E-filed or mailed by \nNovember 6, 2020. (GE 4, at 1, 17-18; GE 6, at 4, 13-14) \n(2018): The federal income tax return was completed by his tax preparer on March \n23, 2020, and the state income tax return was completed on November 2, 2020. Applicant \nclaimed that both the federal and state income tax returns were reportedly either E-filed \nor mailed by November 6, 2020. (GE 4, at 1, 22-25; GE 6, at 4, 15) \n(2019): Both the federal and state income tax returns were completed on \nNovember 2, 2020. Applicant claimed that both the federal and state income tax returns \nwere reportedly either E-filed or mailed by November 6, 2020. (GE 4, at 1, 19-21) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes a condition that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his federal and state income tax \nreturns for the tax years 2012, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. As of September 10, \n2020, the date the SOR was issued, none of those income tax returns had been filed. In \nfact, Applicant conceded that they were not filed until November 6, 2020. AG \u00b6 19(f) has \nbeen established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) minimally applies, but none of the other mitigating conditions apply. \nThe nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing failure to voluntarily and \ntimely resolve those delinquent federal and state income tax issues for several years, \ndespite repeated promises to do so, make it rather easy to conclude that they were not \ninfrequent and, considering the length of time it took him to start to resolve those issues, \nthey are likely to remain unchanged in the future. Applicant attributed his financial issues \nessentially to his depression and anxiety, but he failed to specify in what specific ways \nthose factors were largely beyond his control with respect to timely filing his federal and \nstate income tax returns over a multiyear period.  \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests.

Sept. 18, 2018). \nApplicant completed his SF 86 in May 2018; underwent his interview with an \ninvestigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in December 2018; \ncompleted his responses to the interrogatories on an unspecified date; the SOR was \nissued in September 2020; and the FORM was issued in December 2020. Each step of \nthe security clearance review process placed him on notice of the significance of the \nfinancial issues confronting him. With respect to his unfiled federal and state income tax \nreturns, there is no evidence that Applicant took any action to resolve any of those issues \nbefore the SOR was issued. Instead, he made repeated promises to do so, and none of \nthose promises were fulfilled until November 2020. By failing to do so, he did not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has observed: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015).

Aug. 18, 2015). \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an applicant has \npurportedly corrected his or her federal tax problem, and the fact that the applicant is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof an applicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of his or her longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. (See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well \nthat ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR). \nApplicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. (See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010).) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006))  \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nnetwork engineer with his current employer since June 2017. He previously worked for \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nvarious employers in a variety of positions, including systems engineer; desk-side \ntechnician; domain administrator; and network-support technician. A 2004 graduate, he \nearned some college credits, but no degree. While Applicant claimed in 2018 that he had \nan active secret clearance, it is unclear when that clearance was granted to him. He \ncandidly acknowledged in his SF 86 that he had continuing federal and state income tax \nissues. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant failed to timely file federal and state income tax returns over a multi-\nyear period: for the tax years 2012, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. As of the date the \nSOR was issued in September 2020, none of those income tax returns had been filed. It \nwas not until nearly two months later, that he filed those income tax returns. He claimed \nthat depression and anxiety afflicted his ability to take timely action, and that confusion \nafter the initial delay took place, kept him from resolving the issues for several years \nfollowing the first failure. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on March 20, 2019. On \nAugust 5, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines H and J. The DCSA CAF acted under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, \n2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on a date not reflected in the record, and requested \na decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

He \nreceived the FORM on March 10, 2021, and did not respond or object to the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. The case was assigned to me on May 7, 2021. \nEvidentiary Matters \nItems 1 and 2 contain the pleadings in the case. Items 3 through 5 are admitted \ninto evidence. Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer included an evidentiary document that I admitted \ninto evidence as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. Item 5 was not authenticated as required by \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I conclude that Applicant waived any objection to Item 5. \nThe Government included in the FORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of his right \nto object to the admissibility of Item 5 on the ground that it was not authenticated. \nApplicant was also notified that if he did not raise an objection to Item 5 in his response \nto the FORM, or if he did not respond to the FORM, he could be considered to have \nwaived any such objection, and that Item 5 could be considered as evidence in his case. \nAs noted above, Applicant neither responded to the FORM nor objected to Item 5. \nI sua sponte took administrative notice of the documents discussed below, which \nare identified in the record as Administrative Exhibits (AX) I through X. \nAdministrative Notice \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant referenced a state statute concerning protections for \nthe medical use of marijuana. \nBecause neither party submitted a copy of this statute, I sua sponte appended the \nreferenced statute to the record as AX I. I also appended, as AX II and III, the two \namendments referenced in AX I, and AX IV, a related relevant statute. I sua sponte take \nadministrative notice of the facts contained in AX I through IV, including the following: \n1. \nThe state statute was enacted in 2008. \n2. \nRelevant rules relating to allowable amounts for the use and cultivation of \nmarijuana include: 1) use by a qualified patient of an amount of marijuana \nthat does not exceed a combined total of 2.5 ounces; and a combined total \nof 2.5 ounces, as a primary caregiver for use by each qualifying patient to \nwhom he or she is assisting; 2) cultivation by a qualified patient of 12 \nmarijuana plants; and as a primary caregiver, 12 marijuana plants for each \nregistered qualifying patient. \nI also sua sponte took administrative notice of the fact that the use and possession \nof marijuana is a criminal violation of federal law. Relevant federal guidance, issued by \nthe: Director of National Intelligence (DNI) in October 2014 (AX V); Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) in May 2015 (AX VI); Office of the Attorney General (OAG) in \nJanuary 2018 (AX VII); and Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD) in \nFebruary 2018 (AX VIII), make clear that: 1) marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled \nsubstance under federal law, that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by states, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nterritories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the existing National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines, and that federal marijuana laws supersede state laws; and 2) an \nindividual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of \nmarijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. \nIn August 2016, the Drug Enforcement Administration denied a petition to \nreschedule medical marijuana as a Schedule II controlled substance, on the following \nbasis: \u201c[Marijuana] does not have a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the \nUnited States, there is a lack of accepted safety for its use under medical supervision, \nand it has a high potential for abuse.\u201d (AX IX). \nIn 2008, the state in which Applicant resides enacted a law allowing for the medical \nuse of marijuana, subject to various administrative rules and regulations. (AX X). \nBecause neither party provided the relevant federal guidance, I sua sponte \nappended them to the record as AX V through AX IX, respectively. I also appended the \n2008 state law as AX X. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 37, is unmarried without children. He attended high school from \n1998 through 2002 but did not earn a diploma. He has been employed as a laser tracker \noperator by a defense contractor since February 2015. He was previously employed as \nboth a fabricator and a welder. This is his first application for a security clearance. (Item \n3) \nIn May 2005, Applicant was pulled over for having a headlight out. During a search \nof his vehicle, the police officer discovered marijuana. Applicant was then arrested and \ncharged with one count of misdemeanor possession of dangerous drugs. A prosecutor \nlater amended the charge to one count of possession of marijuana. In October 2005, \nApplicant plead guilty to the amended charge and was sentenced to 12 months of \nprobation. Applicant described the marijuana found in his vehicle as a: marijuana \u201croach\u201d \n(in his SCA); and as \u201cless than 1 gram\u201d of marijuana (in his SOR answer). (Item 2; Item 3 \nat 29; Item 4 at 2-3) \nIn December 2005, Applicant hit a patch of ice and lost control while driving his \nfather\u2019s vehicle. A police officer stopped to assess whether Applicant needed medical \nattention. During a search of his person, the police officer found that Applicant was in \npossession of Vicodin. Applicant told the police officer that it was a prescribed medication, \nbut he did not have either the prescription itself or the bottle with him. Applicant was then \narrested. Subsequent to his arrest, the vehicle was inventoried during which the police \nofficer found marijuana located in a cup holder. Because he could not afford bail and no \none would pay for him to be released, Applicant spent the weekend in jail. While he \nclaimed that the marijuana belonged to his father, and that he did not know that it was in \nthe vehicle, he pled guilty to possession of marijuana for which the court sentenced him \nto one year of probation and fined him $600.

(Item 2; \nItem 3 at 28-29; Item 5 at 2) \nThe SOR alleged that the December 2005 incident occurred in December 2004, \napparently based on the dates Applicant\u2019s self-reported on his March 2019 SCA and \nduring his June 2019 security clearance interview. In his SOR answer, Applicant \namended the date to December 2005, stating \u201cI am now sure it was 2005.\u201d The \nGovernment did not proffer any rebuttal evidence to the 2005 date. (Item 3 at 28-29; Item \n5 at 2) \nOn July 7, 2013, a fire started in the attached garage of a home in which Applicant \nresided with his mother, sister, and niece. The fire resulted from an accidental electrical \nshort with a lawn mower. While searching his home for other fire damage, the public \nsafety officers (PSO) investigating the fire discovered a marijuana cultivation operation. \nAdditional marijuana was found by police officers called to the scene to further search the \nhome. (AE A) \nApplicant asserted that he was operating a medical marijuana cultivation operation \nin accordance with applicable laws. He provided the officers with the required proof that \nhe was licensed to grow medical marijuana for three duly registered persons, including \nhimself as a qualifying patient and two others (his mother and Person A) as qualifying \npatients for whom he was their primary caregiver. However, the officers determined that \nhe had more marijuana plants than was allowed and that persons residing in the home \nhad unauthorized access to the plants. Applicant told the officers that he did not realize \nthat he had too many plants and also advised that \u201csome of the plants may die so [I grow] \nmore.\u201d He acknowledged that the plants were accessible to everyone who lived in the \nhome. He believed that having the doors locked to his home sufficed to secure the plants, \nand claimed not to know that they needed to be in a secured location within the home. \n(AE A) \nThe PSOs confiscated all of the marijuana in the home and told Applicant that he \nwould be advised about future prosecution. The seized marijuana included nine branches \nof marijuana \u201cbuds,\u201d 53 rooted marijuana plants, and 149 grams of marijuana (consisting \nof one foil pan containing 88 grams, and 61 grams divided among six mason jars). The \nseized marijuana was found throughout the house, including the basement, adjacent to \nan upstairs futon, an upstairs drawer, the stairway to an upstairs room, and the upstairs \nattic bedroom. The Department of Public Safety (DPS) deemed that Applicant forfeited \nthe seized marijuana because he never contacted them to claim any of it. On or about \nJuly 12, 2013, Applicant was charged with: 1) felony delivery and manufacturing of \nmarijuana; 2) misdemeanor maintaining a drug house; and 3) misdemeanor use of \nmarijuana. In November 2013, he pled guilty to charge #3 for which he was fined $225. \nCharges #1 and #2 were dismissed. (AE A; Item 3 at 25-26; Item 5 at 2-3; Item 4 at 3-4) \nAccording to the incident report issued by the DPS, for three individuals, Applicant \nwas allowed a total of 36 plants (12 per individual) and 7.5 grams (2.5 grams per \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nindividual).

The applicable state law allows a total of 212.62 grams \nor 7.5 ounces for three duly registered individuals (70.87 grams or 2.5 ounces for each \nindividual), which Applicant did not exceed. He argued that a \u201cmajor portion\u201d of his excess \n17 \u201crooted plants\u201d consisted of \u201csmall cuttings [he] had just made and were not in the soil \nlong.\u201d He stated: \u201cI made more than I was going to grow into larger plants because some \nwould take badly to the soil and some would die as I told the officers in the reports.\u201d He \nasserted that he had no intent to grow more than the allowable amount of plants. He \nacknowledged that \u201cit was a mistake\u201d not to be more strict with his plant count. He has \nnot cultivated any medicinal marijuana since the July 2013 incident and does not have \nany plans to do so. (AE A; Item 2; AX I through IV) \nApplicant began smoking marijuana recreationally in the form of a cigarette, pipe, \nor bong at the age of 15, when he was in high school. From age 15 to about age 18, he \nsmoked marijuana only on the weekends with friends in social settings. From about age \n18 to age 26, he smoked marijuana approximately three to four times per week, in both \nsocial settings and by himself. During that period, sometimes he used more than that and \nsometimes less. In about 2009, at age 26, Applicant discovered that marijuana could help \nwith his chronic back pain. He was evaluated by a doctor and received a medical \nmarijuana license from his state \u201caround 2010.\u201d The record does not indicate the \ncircumstances or frequency of his medical marijuana use or the degree to which he may \nhave used marijuana recreationally after receiving his marijuana license. He described \nthe form of medical marijuana he used as: a vaporizer (during his June 2019 security \nclearance interview); and \u201cmainly edibles\u201d (in his SOR answer). (Item 2; Item 5 at 3) \nApplicant\u2019s chronic back pain resulted from a herniated disk injury he sustained in \n2004 for which he was initially prescribed Vicodin as treatment. He used Vicodin as \nprescribed until 2005, when he began abusing it. The record does not indicate the \ncircumstances or frequency of his Vicodin use. In April 2005, Applicant voluntarily sought \nand received treatment for his abuse of Vicodin. He completed only the detoxification \nportion of the program. After his father passed away in April 2006, he returned for the full \nprogram in May 2006. In December 2008, he voluntarily sought and received treatment \nagain because he had become dependent on Vicodin. This time, he attended an \noutpatient suboxone maintenance program. Suboxone is the medication that he was \nprescribed to treat his opioid dependency. He maintained that he never abused Subxone \nand only used it as prescribed by his doctor until February 2019, when he had \nsuccessfully weaned off of the medication pursuant to a careful plan established by his \ndoctor. The record contained scant details about the nature of his treatment, such as his \ntreatment status (e.g. whether he successfully completed the programs he attended), the \naftercare requirements, his prognoses, or whether the period of his Suboxone use was \nreasonable. In his SCA, Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question of whether he \nsuccessfully completed his 2006 and 2008 treatment programs. (Item 2; Item 3 at 31-32; \nItem 5 at 3-4) \nApplicant attributed his use of medical marijuana and his abuse of and dependency \non Vicodin to his 2004 back injury.

He also uses over-\nthe-counter pain relievers, as needed. These efforts have helped him avoid using \nmarijuana or prescribed pain medications. Nowhere in the record does Applicant explicitly \nstate his intent regarding his future use of marijuana or Vicodin. (Item 2; Item 5 at 3) \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant stated: \nI know that I have made some mistakes in the past and I take full \nresponsibility for them. I have learned from my mistakes and believe I am a \nbetter person for it today. I no longer associate with any of the people I \ncalled friends that were in my life during the years I was having problems. I \nrealized that without changing my friends I would never be able to make any \nserious changes in life for the better and I believe it was the right decision. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

(Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)).

(ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe facts and circumstances of Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana and Vicodin establish \nthe following disqualifying conditions (DC) under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 (d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed \nclinical social worker) of substance use disorder. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility; \nAG \u00b6 26(c): abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged \nillness during which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since \nended; and \nAG \u00b6 26(d): satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use, both recreationally and medicinally, spanned 19 years, \nfrom 1998 through 2017. His Vicodin abuse and dependency spanned three years, from \n2005 through 2008. The state in which Applicant resides has allowed medical marijuana \nuse since 2008 and he obtained his medical marijuana license in 2010. He cultivated \nmarijuana for a period of time pursuant to that license until he was found in violation of \ncertain terms of that license in 2013. Not only has Applicant used marijuana in \ncontravention of federal law, but he also violated state law for a significant period. \nArguably, Applicant\u2019s drug-related criminal convictions would lack security \nsignificance if viewed in isolation, given the time that has passed since 2005 and 2013. \nHowever, together with the facts and circumstances of his drug use, they underscore a \npattern of questionable judgment that casts doubt on his ability or willingness to comply \nwith laws, rules, and regulations. \nNowhere in the record does Applicant explicitly state his intent regarding his future \nuse of marijuana or Vicodin. Also absent is a signed statement of intent to abstain from \nall drug involvement and substance misuse. However, he has taken meaningful steps \ntowards recovery and demonstrated a pattern of abstinence by not using marijuana in \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nover three years or Vicodin in over 12 years.

He no longer associates with the \nfriends that were in his life \u201cduring the years [he] was having problems.\u201d He implemented \nnew behaviors and strategies to address his back pain. He accepted full responsibility for \nhis past mistakes. \nHowever, weighing strongly against mitigation is the paucity of evidence about the \nnature of his treatment and his prognosis. Even assuming that he successfully completed \nthe programs he attended, without more clinical information about his treatments, his \naftercare requirements and risk for relapse are unknown. The fact that he continued to \nuse marijuana following his treatment and during periods when he was on Suboxone \nmaintenance is concerning. There remains a question of whether his extended use of \nSuboxone over 10 years was reasonable under the circumstances. Moreover, he weaned \noff of Suboxone relatively recently considering his prolonged history of drug use. \nGiven the record as a whole and these unsettled issues, I am unable to conclude \nthat his drug use is unlikely to recur and I have lingering doubts about his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(c) was established. However, AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(d) were not established, and AG \u00b6 26(b) was only partially established. \nThe application of some mitigating factors does not suffice to mitigate the overall \nGuideline H concerns. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \nApplicant\u2019s drug-related convictions in 2005 and 2013 establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nApplicant has not been convicted of criminal activity since 2013. He has not used \nmarijuana in over three years. However, the facts and circumstances surrounding his \n2013 conviction were troubling as was his conviction of a second offense in 2005 while \non probation. Although not alleged in the SOR under Guideline J, for the purpose of \nevaluating mitigation, I must consider that his marijuana use after 2013 violated federal \nlaw. Incorporating my analysis under Guideline H, and given the nature of his offenses \nand lingering concerns about his risk for relapse, there has not been a passage of time \nsufficient to conclude that his criminal misconduct is unlikely to recur.

While 32(b) was established, it does not suffice to mitigate the ongoing \nGuideline J concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and J in my whole-person \nanalysis, and considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guidelines H and J, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his illegal drug use and criminal conduct.

The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960); Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program, DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (undated), and elected to have his case decided \non the basis of the written record, in lieu of a hearing.

(Item A) \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly resides with his mother and father in the \nUnited States, who are undocumented aliens. Applicant admitted the SOR allegations \n(1.a and 1.b). He disclosed his parents have jobs and driver\u2019s licenses. (Item 2) He \nprovided no other information to substantiate they have U.S. residency. His parents are \naware that Applicant is attempting to obtain a security clearance. (GE 2) Without \nupdated information from Applicant, his parents ensuing residency continues to be \nillegal in violation of U.S. immigration laws. \nUnder Guideline H, Applicant denied in his answer to the SOR allegation that he \nused marijuana with varying frequency from August 2013 to at least November 2019. \nHe provided no explanation. (2.a) He later admitted the allegation in his security \nclearance application. (GE 2) He noted he used weed, hashish and THC. Applicant \nstated that it does not catch his interest. He knows that he did not do the right thing by \nusing illegal drugs on a recreational basis. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 24-year-old assembler technician who is applying for a position \nwith a government contractor. He graduated from high school and has taken some \ncollege classes and trade courses. He is single and has no children. He is seeking a \nsecurity clearance. The admitted allegations are incorporated and adopted as relevant \nand material findings. Additional findings follow. \nDrug Involvement \nApplicant admitted that he did not do the right thing by using recreational drugs. \nHe stated it is one of his biggest regrets. He wants to learn from his mistakes. However, \nApplicant confirmed that the reason for his most recent use of marijuana in 2019 was \ndue to a coworker at a concert. (Response to FORM) When he was younger, he used \nmarijuana because his friends smoked the substance. He continues to see the coworker \nevery day at work. (GE3) \nApplicant assured his marijuana use never had a negative effect on his personal \nor professional life. Whether he has continued using marijuana after 2019 is unclear. \nWithout more information, it is difficult to determine whether his claimed monthly use of \nmarijuana between 2013 and 2019 was accurately reported. \nTo be sure, state law covering marijuana activities in Applicant\u2019s state of \nresidence does legalize marijuana use. See State A\u2019s Proposition 64 (approved by \nvoters in 2016).However, whatever law Applicant might claim compliance with in his \nstate of residence is preempted by federal law when evaluating the compatibility of drug \n2 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder the terms and conditions of the CSA (21 U.S.C. \u00b6 801 et seq.), Congress \ngenerally prohibited the cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana. (Item 10) \nIt established significant penalties for these crimes. (21 U.S.C. \u00b6 841 et seq.) These \nstatutes reflect Congress\u2019s determination that marijuana is a dangerous drug and that \nmarijuana activity is a serious crime. DoD guidelines implementing the federal legal ban \ncovering marijuana use and possession require federal prosecutors to weigh all relevant \nconsiderations when making prosecution decisions. (Item 10)   \n \n \nWhile the CSA has been challenged on federalism grounds, the courts have not  \nattempted to validate the enabling provisions of the state\u2019s enabling medicinal \nexception. Instead, the Supreme Court in Oakland Cannabis Buyers Court (532 U.S. \n483 (2001)) reaffirmed the federal preemption of the state\u2019s competing law legalizing \nmarijuana use for medicinal purposes. In doing so, the Oakland Cannabis Buyers Court \nextended its oversight role in ensuring that federal preemption jurisdiction over illegal \ndrug violators without regard to the state\u2019s marijuana exception. \n \n \nBuilding on its Oakland Cannabis Buyers precedent, the Supreme Court seized \nthe opportunity to refine and clarify the reach of its Oakland Cannabis Buyers precedent \nin Raich v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 1, 8-14 (2005) In Raich, the Court addressed the claims \nof two state residents who suffered from a variety of serious medical conditions and \nsought to avail themselves of medical marijuana pursuant to the terms of their state\u2019s \nmedial exception. Notwithstanding that county investigating officials had found that one \nrespondent\u2019s medical use of marijuana was entirely lawful, federal agents seized and \ndestroyed all six of her cannabis plants.  \n \n \nIn validating the federal seizure, the Raich Court held that the regulation of \nmarijuana under the CSA was fully within Congress\u2019 commerce power (U.S., art. 1, \u00b6 8), \nbecause marijuana production intended for home production could have a substantial \neffect on the supply and demand in the national market. The Raich Court reasoned that \nfederal failure to regulate the interstate manufacturing and possession of marijuana \nwould leave a considerable gap in the CSA. In turn, the Court vacated the Ninth \nCircuit\u2019s judgment. Federal law has and continues to control any marijuana use initiated \nby Applicant.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ninvolvement (marijuana included) with eligibility requirements for holding a DoD-covered \nsecurity clearance.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n                                                            Personal Conduct \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Concern: Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription \ndrug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it \nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability and willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules, and regulations.

AG \n\u00b6 15. \nDrug Involvement \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 8 are admitted into evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 44-year-old consultant, employed by a government contractor since \nFebruary 2019. He is also currently self-employed as a real estate sales person since \nApril 2017. He was terminated from a job in April 2016. Applicant reported that he was \nunemployed from March 2016 to February 2017, despite his termination in April 2017. \nFrom 2006 to 2016, Applicant attended various universities and colleges, but did not \nattain a degree. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1995 to 2015, and was honorably \ndischarged. He was previously married in June 1997 and divorced in October 2010; and \nagain married in June 2011 and divorced in October 2011. He is currently married since \nDecember 2012, and has seven children. Applicant was granted a conditional secret \nsecurity clearance in 2003 with a caution for financial concerns after financial \ndelinquencies and a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. He again received a conditional security \nclearance in November 2007 with cautions for alcohol abuse and financial concerns \n(delinquent debts). \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant is delinquent on debts totaling \nabout $55,520 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i). In addition, the SOR alleges that Applicant filed Chapter \n7 bankruptcy on or about July 2002, and the bankruptcy was discharged in February 2004 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.j). Applicant admitted all of the allegations with explanations. He also provided \nmitigating evidence with his Answer. The record indicates that Applicant hired an attorney \nto negotiate settlements of his debts. \nApplicant stated in his Answer to each SOR debt allegation, that he was laid off \ndue to his Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) rated disability, which caused him to fall \nbehind on debts. He has a 100% VA disability rating, with a 30% portion for anxiety \ndisorder, insomnia, and other stressors and trauma-related disorder (also known as post-\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combat and memory loss), and alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant was terminated from a job with a bank on April 11, 2016, due to his inability to \nreturn to work. His termination letter does not specify the reasons for his inability to return \nto work, but stated that he was not eligible for Family Medical Leave and was therefore \nterminated from his position. Applicant stated in his 2019 personal subject interview (PSI) \nby a Government investigator that he \u201cput off\u201d completing his VA disability application \nafter being discharged from the Navy, and instead took time from his employment at the \nbank to work on his VA disability requirements. He acknowledges that he \u201cknowingly \nparticipated in his termination\u201d and rather than quit the job, he elected to be terminated. \nIn 2002, Applicant filed a joint Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. He initially claimed \nabout $73,000 in secured and unsecured claims, but amended his petition in 2004 to add \nan additional $12,033 in unsecured claims.

(GE 6) There is insufficient evidence to show that this \ndebt was partially paid or is being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a $240 collection account from a satellite television provider. \nApplicant stated in his Answer that the debt became delinquent as a result of his 2016 \ntermination, and that he has since satisfied the debt. No documentation of resolution of \nthe debt was provided. Applicant\u2019s 2019 credit report shows the debt went to collections \nin 2019, and is unpaid.

In his PSI, Applicant denied knowing anything about the account. However, with \nhis Answer, he provided a letter from a collections firm showing the furniture store account \nwas paid in full as of March 30, 2020. This debt is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a medical collection account for $44. Applicant stated in his Answer \nthat the debt became delinquent as a result of his 2016 termination, and that he has since \nsatisfied the debt. No documentation of resolution of the debt was provided.

There is insufficient evidence to show that this debt was paid or \notherwise resolved. \nSince submitting his Answer to the SOR, no further evidence has been provided \nto update or clarify Applicant\u2019s answers to the SOR despite Department Counsel\u2019s FORM \nexplanation of Applicant\u2019s burden of proof. In addition, Applicant did not provide evidence \nof financial counseling, his current financial status, character, or employment record to \nassist me in evaluating his financial status and the \u201cwhole person\u201d record. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information.

Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

The circumstances of the termination show that his voluntary actions \ncaused his termination, not a condition beyond his control. Insufficient persuasive \nevidence was provided tying Applicant\u2019s 30% VA disability rating for PTSD to his \nemployment termination. In addition, most of the debts were incurred well after Applicant\u2019s \nperiod of unemployment that lasted between approximately April 2016 and February \n2017. Since that time, Applicant has made efforts to resolve debts with the help of an \nattorney after he learned in his 2019 PSI that the debts may impact his security clearance. \nHowever, the evidence in the record supports resolution of only four of nine debts, and \ntwo of the resolved debts included substantial creditor charge offs. \nApplicant has a long history of incurring delinquent debts since a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy discharge of debts in 2004. I am not persuaded that he ever regained control \nof his finances, has showed financial responsibility, or is diligent about meeting his \nfinancial responsibilities. In addition, I am unclear as to why Applicant failed to pay debts \nafter his period of unemployment, and ignored the debts until his security eligibility was \nquestioned. \nApplicant choose to have a decision issued on the record, but has done little to \nprovide persuasive mitigating information for my consideration, or to fully explain his \nfinancial history, current financial status, or how his disability impacted his ability to meet \nfinancial obligations. \nI am not persuaded that Applicant has a handle on all of his debts, has taken \nsufficient action to resolve those that remain, or has shown financial responsibility over \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe years. As a result and without more documentary evidence, I remain doubtful about \nApplicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nApplicant is credited for resolving the accounts that I noted as resolved, but he \nfailed to show that continued delinquencies are unlikely to recur. Additionally, I am not \npersuaded that the conditions that resulted in his financial problem were largely beyond \nhis control, or that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. Finally, he has not \nshown that he initiated and is adhering to a good-faith efforts to repay the remaining \ncreditors or otherwise resolving the remaining debts. Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy is not a \nfinancial concern, but is evidence of a history of financial problems. For these reasons, \nnone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge \nmust evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality \nof the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d). The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service, disability ratings, and period of unemployment. However, \nApplicant has not provided sufficient evidence to show the resolution of the remaining \nSOR debts and his overall financial responsibility. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.h, and 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer, his testimony, and the \ndocumentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 56 years old. He was born in Mexico and entered the United States \nwith his family in 1971 at age 6.He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1999. He married \nin 1982 at age 17 and did not graduate from high school. He was widowed in 2009. He \nand his deceased wife have three adult children. He remarried in 2016. His second wife \nhas three adult children, one of whom lives with Applicant and her mother. Applicant\u2019s \nwife works at a church. Since 2001 he has worked for four different employers as a \nmachinist. In 2019 he began working for his current employer, a major DoD contractor. \nHis current position requires that he have eligibility for a security clearance. (Tr. at 17-21, \n40-43.) \nApplicant worked for Company A from 2001 until 2015, when the employer went \nbankrupt. He then worked for Company B for three months until he was unexpectedly \nterminated. The reason for his termination was that he did not meet the employer\u2019s \nstandards. He worked for Company C from 2016 to August 2018. He began working for \nCompany D, the DoD contractor, immediately after terminating his employment with \nCompany C. (Tr. at 17-21; GE 2 at 2.) \nSince the death of his first wife, Applicant began to experience financial problems \ndue to excessive credit-card debt. For a long period, he had negative cash flow every \nmonth, and he made up the difference with credit cards. His expenses were for his rent, \nfood, car payments, insurance, and other general living expenses of his children while \nthey were growing up. One of his sons went to college, and Applicant paid a lot of the \nson\u2019s expenses with credit cards rather than student loans.

His children continued to live with him until 2016, when he remarried and moved \nout of the family home. The children also moved out at that time. He got behind on his \nbills with excessive debts, and he could not recover for several years. His annual income \nin the 2015-2016 time period when he worked for Company A and Company B was about \n$60,000. His income continued at that level until 2018 when he began working for \nCompany D, his current employer. In 2018, his annual income increased to about \n$80,000. It was at that time that he was able to begin repaying his debts using the services \nof a debt-relief company (D/R Company). (Tr.at 25-31, 41-42.) \nApplicant reported on his SCA that he was delinquent on 15 credit accounts, \nconsisting primarily of bank credit cards and retail store credit cards. He advised that he \nhad an estimated total delinquent debt of about $62,500. He reported in his SCA that the \nfinancial delinquencies all began in about October 2015. In September 2018, about one \nyear before he submitted his SCA, Applicant hired the D/R Company. To qualify for debt \nrelief, his counselor advised Applicant to stop paying his debts for three months. He \nfollowed his counselor\u2019s advice, and instead, he began making payments to the bank of \nthe D/R Company.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR Answer and his testimony, as well as the \ndocumentary evidence in the record, establish the following disqualifying conditions under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Four of them have possible applicability to the \nfacts of this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts arose as a result of his overspending to pay for the needs of his \nfamily, and expenses related to the final illness and funeral of his first wife. While these \nare not unusual expenses, they are unlikely to recur. His children have grown up and are \nno longer Applicant\u2019s financial responsibility. He has controlled his spending since 2018 \nwhen he was given the opportunity to work for a new employer at a higher pay rate. He \nhas been able to pay $800 per month to the D/R Company for almost three years. Those \nfunds are being productively used to resolve his debts. It is unlikely that he will overspend \nwith credit cards in the future and repeat the costly mistakes of his past. His behavior \nprior to 2018 does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is established. \nA portion of Applicant\u2019s indebtedness was caused by expenses related to the final \nillness and death of his first wife. This was a circumstance beyond his control. He was \nmarried to his wife for 27 years before she died. He did what was necessary to support \nher and their family during a difficult period. While Applicant was unable to catch up on \nhis debts and repay them until 2018 when he began to earn more income, once he started \nworking for Company D and increased his income by 33 percent, he acted responsibly by \ncontracting with the D/R Company to negotiate and pay his debts. By paying the D/R \nCompany $800 per month every month, he made a serious commitment to resolve his \ndebts. He acted responsibly under the circumstances.

This financial \ncounseling company has shown by its history of working with Applicant over the past \nthree years that the company is a legitimate and credible source of financial counseling. \nMoreover, there are clear indications that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are being \nresolved. AG \u00b6 20(c) is established. \nIn 2018 Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to repay his debts. Applicant\u2019s good \nfaith is evidenced by the fact that he took the step of hiring the D/R Company one year \nbefore he submitted his SCA to seek a security clearance. He has faithfully adhered to \nthe repayment plan developed by the D/R Company by having $800 automatically \nwithdrawn every month from his bank account. While he has more debts to repay, he has \ndemonstrated with a three year track record that he is determined to finish the repayment \nplan and become debt free. AG \u00b6 20(d) is established. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the applicable \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all of the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his \nindebtedness. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.l: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interests of the United States \nto grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

The record closed at that time. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted to all the allegations in SOR, with explanations, except for \nSOR allegation \u00b6 4.b. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has a Master\u2019s \nof Science degree, and has been employed with the defense contractor since June of \n2010. (TR at page 7 lines 9~25, and GX 1 at pages 7 and 15.) Applicant has held a \nsecurity clearance since 2001, initially as a member of the U.S. Marine Corps. (GX 1 at \npages 36~38.) His \u201cless than a year and a half\u201d marriage was annulled in 2014. (TR at \npage 22 lines 5~23, and GX 1 at page 23.) \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations & Guideline E - Personal Conduct \n1.a. and 4.c. Applicant admits that he failed to file his Federal and state income \ntax returns for tax years 2014~2018 in a timely fashion. He mistakenly \u201cbelieved\u201d that \nApplicant did not have \u201cto file the taxes unless . . . [he] owed money.\u201d (TR at page 25 \nline 18 to page 26 line 13.) In 2019 and 2020, he has filed returns for those tax years as \nevidenced by documentation from the taxing authorities. (TR at page 40 lines 19~23, at \npage 51 lines 7~34, and AppX I.) \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse & Guideline E - Personal \nConduct \n \n2.a. and 4.c. Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency, from about 2009 \nto at least August of 2018 (a period of more than ten years) while holding a security \nclearance. (TR at page 30 line 22 to page 31 line 2, at page 34 line 8 to page 36 line 19, \nat page 37 lines 1-~25, and at page 40 line 24 to page 41 line 23.) He avers that he did \nnot know the use of marijuana was illegal under Federal law, as it was legalized under \nstate law. (Id.) \nThis averment is countered by the fact Applicant used both his former spouse\u2019s \nand current girlfriend\u2019s marijuana prescription to obtain the drug. (TR at page 65 lines \n7~11, at page 67 line 5 to page 68 line 11, and at page 71 line 17 to page 75 line 1.) \nFurthermore, such usage is clearly contrary to his employer\u2019s drug policy that clearly \nstates: \u201cEven though marijuana has been legalized in certain US states, it is still \nconsidered illegal under federal law. Therefore, our company prohibits use even in \nlocations where it is not against state law.\u201d (TR at page 83 line 1 to page 84 line 5, at \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \npage 85 line 17 to page 88 line 1, and GX 3 at page 2.) Applicant intends no future \nillegal drug usage. (AppX J.) \n \n2.b. and 4.c. Applicant used Hallucinogenic Mushrooms twice in 2010 while \nholding a security clearance. Again, he avers he did not know such use was illegal. (TR \nat page 23 line 16 to page 24 line 2.) This averment does not pass scrutiny, particularly \nas his employer warns against the use of drugs that may impair decision making. (TR at \npage 75 line 2 to page 76 line 7, and GX 3 at page 2.) Although it appears that his \nemployer alludes to on-the-job conduct, \u201cloose lips can sink ships\u201d off-the-job, where \njudgment is impaired by hallucinogens. Applicant intends no future illegal drug usage. \n(AppX J.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption & Guideline E - Personal Conduct \n3.a.~3.d. and 4.c. Applicant admits that between 2011 and April of 2020, he \nconsumed alcohol at times in excess and to the point of intoxication. (TR at page 31 \nlines 3~25, and at page 42 lines 2~11.) Applicant further admits that alcohol was \ninvolved, in about 2013, when he threatened a university employee, who was \u201ccheating\u201d \nwith his then wife. (TR at page 46 line 4 to page 47 line 6.) He also admits that alcohol \nwas involved, in about 2013, when he physically assaulted his former spouse who was \n\u201ccheating\u201d on Applicant. (TR at page 43 line 12 to page 45 line 9.) In 2018, Applicant \nmissed work, pursuant to his doctor\u2019s instruction, to address his alcohol consumption. \n(TR at page 42 lines 12~22.) \n \nApplicant now attends Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) on a regular basis, and last \nconsumed the intoxicant in April of 2020, about a year prior to his hearing. (TR at page \n31 lines 3~25.) In February of 2021, Applicant was evaluated by a Licensed Clinical \nSocial Worker, who diagnosed Applicant as suffering from \u201cMild Alcohol Use Disorder \n\u2013 In Sustained Remission.\u201d (AppX K at page 9, emphasis in original.) She further \nopined: \u201cNo Treatment Warranted. Continued participation in the fellowship of \nAlcoholics Anonymous, regular meeting with his sponsor, and working the steps.\u201d (Id.)  \n \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \n4.a. Applicant answer \u201cNo\u201d to Section 23 on his March 2018 SCA as to \u201cIllegal \nUse of Drugs . . . in the last (7) seven years . . . [and] While possessing a Security \nClearance.\u201d (SCA at pages 34~35.) This was a willful falsification, as he admits to using \nmarijuana pursuant to the prescriptions of his former spouse and his current girlfriend. \n \n \n4.b. Applicant knowingly provided materially false information during a November \n2018 interview with a DoD investigator as to his above-mentioned illegal drug usage. \n(TR at page 47 lines 14~21.)     \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.c. This allegation has been discussed at length, above. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture.  \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n  \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to file five years of taxes in a timely fashion. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant is now aware of his filing responsibilities, even if he owes no taxes. He \nis current with his filings. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has been established. Financial \nConsiderations is found for Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nAppellant used Hallucinogenic Mushrooms, smoked marijuana, misused the \nprescriptions of his former spouse and current girlfriend. He had a security clearance for \nhis job at that time. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), (c), and (f) are established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains several conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug usage is fairly recent, Marijuana in 2018. The fact that he \nused it on numerous times while holding a security clearance is also problematic. \nMitigation has not been established. Drug Involvement is found against Applicant. \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions may apply: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant has been diagnosed as suffering from a Mild Alcohol Use Disorder, and \nhad alcohol-related incidents in 2013. These facts establish prima facie support for the \nforegoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those \nconcerns. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Three conditions may apply: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related incidents were about eight years ago. He has ceased \nhis alcohol consumption, and attends AA on a regular basis. His usage has been \ncharacterized as being in Sustained Remission. Alcohol Consumption is found for \nApplicant.  \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nApplicant falsified his SCA, and was not truthful during his subsequent interview. \nHe also used illegal substances while holding a security clearance. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F, H, G, and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant was less than candid with the Government about his past-drug abuse. \nThat usage was while Applicant held a security clearance. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nDrug Involvement and Personal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b.: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 3, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a.~3.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a.~ 4.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Tr. 18) She obtained her \nundergraduate degree in 2014. She reports no military service. Applicant completed her \nsecurity clearance application on April 26, 2019. (GE 1) She is being sponsored for a \nsecurity clearance. She has been unemployed since April 2019. (GE 2) She has never \nheld a security clearance. \nFINANCIAL \nThe SOR alleges in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a -1.l that Applicant has 12 student loan debts \nplaced in collection in the approximate amount of $38,000, and one consumer collection \naccount in the amount of $160. (SOR\u00b6 1.m) Applicant admitted all the student loan debts, \nbut denied 1.m as she has no idea what the account represents. (Answer to SOR) The \nstudent loans are from 2010 to 2014. (Tr. 24) \nApplicant attributes her inability to pay her student loans to low paying jobs, helping \nher siblings pay their tuition, and helping her mother who had a stroke. She believes that \nshe made some small payments in 2017 or 2018, and she believed she received a phone \ncall that her student loans were deferred. (Tr. 25) She thought the payments were $25 a \nmonth. (Tr. 26) She added that the money was being deducted from her checking \naccount. Applicant stated that she could not get statements from her bank to substantiate \nthe payments. (Tr. 27) However, she insisted that the loans were kept in deferment \nindefinitely because she could not pay. (Tr.30) She believes that she talked to the \nDepartment of Education about six months ago and was told to call back when she could \npay. \nShe worked in the state where her mother lived and moved to another state to find \nwork. She found a part-time job during the holidays. (Tr. 28) She stated that she never \nmade more than $40,000. She was not clear when that was. At one point she thought \nthat maybe she was paying money to a scammer. (Tr. 36) \nIn 2019, Applicant secured a full time job for one year, but she claims that she was \nstill not making enough money to pay anything on the student loans. (Tr. 38) She is firm \nin her belief that she never received any paper work from the Department of Education. \nShe stated that they always called her. She has no idea how much she has paid on the \nstudent loans in the past seven years. She admitted that she had another full time job \nfrom 2016 to 2017, but made no payments on the student loans. She believes her hourly \nwages varied from $13 to $16 to perhaps $30. \nApplicant wants to pay her student loans and interviews often. However, the \nmoney she earns goes to financially helping her mother. Applicant travels between states. \nShe acknowledged that before COVID, she has not made any efforts to pay.

Applicant admitted she knew she had debt and had \ndiscussed it with her investigator. (GE 2) Applicant answered \u201cYES\u201d to having debt in her \nanswer to the SOR. However, at the hearing she attributed the non-disclosure to lack of \nknowledge about the security clearance application. She did not think the Government \ncared about finances. (Tr. 52) \nAs to SOR \u00b6 2.b, when Applicant completed her April 2019, SF-86 in response to \nSection 13A \u2013 Employment Activities she answered \u201cNO to whether she had ever been \nfired or terminated in the past seven years. By answering \u201cNo\u201d, she falsified her answer \nto the SF-86. She was terminated in March 2018 for failure to follow company policy..(GE \n2) At the hearing, Applicant blamed the action on the company and said she was going \nto quit. (Tr. 55) \nAs to SOR \u00b6 2.c, Applicant falsified material facts on her SF 85-6 in April 2019, \nwhen she answered \u201cNO\u201d to Section 13A, in the past seven years have you been officially \nreprimanded, suspended, or received written warnings in 2017, 2018, (3), written \ncounseling in 2018, letter of suspension, letter of reprimand and two written warnings in \n2018. Applicant agreed to the 2017, 2018 2019, terminations and various warnings during \nher subject interview in 2019. (GE 2) However in her answer to the SOR, she blamed the \nvarious companies because she felt attacked and pressured. At the hearing, she admitted \nthat she should have answered \u201cyes.\u201d (Tr. 57) \nAs to SOR \u00b6 2.d, Applicant falsified material facts on her April 2019 SF-86 by \nanswering \u201cNO\u201d to Section 13A \u2013 Employment Activities, when she failed to disclose that \nshe was terminated in December 2015. In her subject interview she admitted that she \nwas fired but disagreed with the reason. (GE 2) \nAs to SOR \u00b6 2.e, Applicant falsified material facts on her April 2019 SF-86 in \nResponse to Section 13- Employment Activities, because she answered \u201cNO\u201d and she \nwas terminated in August 2013 for failure to follow company policy. She admitted this in \nher subject interview. (GE 2) \nAs to \u00b6 2.f, Applicant denied falsifying any documents or receiving a written \ncounseling. The counseling was for leaving early from work. However, she stated that he \ntore it up and checked the cameras. She was credible in that she did not leave early.

Each time she claimed it was the \nemployer\u2019s fault. (Tr. 75) In Applicant\u2019s interrogatories and subject interview, she \ndiscussed her employment history including her various warnings and terminations over \nthe years from various employers. (GE 2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO \n10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent student loans are long-standing and she acknowledged that \nshe has not provided evidence of payment or payment plans for any of the delinquent \ndebts. She believes her salary was so low she could not pay and she believed that the \nstudent loans were deferred. She helped her family financially, but keeps promising that \nshe will pay the student loans when she has a better income. He provided no proof that \nshe disputed accounts. She has not acted responsibly. AG \u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) are not \nestablished. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unresolved and she provided no plan or \nproof of any earlier payments. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant did not receive any financial \ncounseling nor are there clear indications that her financial situation is under control. She \nhas not yet established a payment plan. Her financial problems are not under control. \nAny doubts must be resolved in favor of the Government. \nApplicant failed to meet her burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the \nSOR. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.m against Applicant. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s alleged admitted non-disclosures on her April 2019 security \nclearance application, I find that she deliberately failed to disclose material facts. She did \nnot give  credible answers She had discussed the issues of warnings, terminations, etc \nin her subject interview. She wants a security clearance to better her job prospects. \nAG \u00b6 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAn omission, standing alone, does not prove a falsification. An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the \ntime of the omission.1  An applicant\u2019s level of education and business experience are \nrelevant to determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on an SCA was \ndeliberate. 2   \nIn this instance, it is clear from Applicant\u2019s comments at the hearing that she knew \nthat she had not paid on her student loans because she did not have the ability to pay. \nShe also blamed the many employment violations on her four different employers. I find \nthat Applicant intentionally falsified material information about her debts and the various \nterminations and warnings that she received over the years. AG \u00b6 16(a) is established. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n1 See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). \n2 ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd.

After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, including Applicant\u2019s lack of credibility and vagueness at \nthe hearing, I conclude that she deliberately falsified the various forms alleged in the SOR. \nShe also has no plan for paying her student loans and provided no proof that they are \nindefinitely deferred. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried her burden of showing that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.m:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2:d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

The case was assigned to me on August 3, 2021. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 are admitted into evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 59-year-old HVAC Supervisor, employed by a government \ncontractor since May 2017. He is a high school graduate, and was previously self-\nemployed as an HVAC technician from 1998 to 2017. He is unmarried and has two \nchildren. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to file Federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2010, and 2015-2018, as required. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) It also alleges that \nApplicant is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent Federal taxes from tax \nyear 2010, for $26,000. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) Applicant admitted the allegations with explanations. \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he borrowed money in 2010 to buy \na house as an investment. Although he did not miss any mortgage payments, he \neventually sold another home and moved into the investment house in order to make \nends meet. He was financially overextended as he said he lost money on the investment \ndue to market conditions at the time, and did not have funds to pay Federal income taxes. \nIn addition, his brother\u2019s mother-in-law was his tax preparer until she retired in 2015. He \ndid not follow up with the new preparer, and fell behind on filing his Federal income tax \nreturns. Instead, he said that he focused on the dissolution of his relationship with the \nmother of his children, and rebuilding his business. He became a single father of his \nteenaged children in April 2017. \nApplicant also stated that he paid down his $26,000 tax debt from tax year 2010, \nand now owes approximately $18,000. He referenced an IRS notice from September \n2020 that he submitted with his Answer, however the IRS letter is a notification that his \noverpayment of 2019 taxes was applied toward his tax year 2009 tax debt, not his 2010 \ndebt, and that he owes $18,090 for 2009. Applicant may have confused the tax year in \nwhich he is delinquent. \nIn response to Government interrogatories from April 2020, Applicant noted that \nhe had not filed his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2010, 2015, and 2018, but \nthat he was going to file them \u201cASAP.\u201d He also claimed that his accountant was working \non his tax returns for 2016 and 2017. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant provided \nreceipts for certified mailings to the IRS, with handwritten notations of his name with \u201c2010 \n1040\u201d; \u201c2015 1040\u201d; and \u201c2016.\u201d He also provided an \u201celectronic filing client status history\u201d \napparently showing a tax return electronically filed with the IRS in May 2020, but the only \npossible indication of the tax year involved is from a handwritten notation of \u201c2017\u201d at the \ntop of the page. None of these \u201creceipts\u201d conclusively shows the substance of the \nmailings, and Applicant did not provide a copy of any completed tax returns. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations, and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and documentary evidence in the record are sufficient to \nestablish disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c) and (f). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant asserted that his tax issues arose from losses from an investment \nproperty, difficulties with a personal relationship and rebuilding a business. However, I \nnote that Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor since 2017. Applicant \nhas not submitted sufficient or persuasive evidence to show how his past financial and \npersonal issues impeded his ability to file Federal income tax returns and pay taxes as \nrequired. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has long held: \nSecurity requirements include consideration of a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and a sense of his or her legal obligations. Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union, Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Failure to comply with federal tax laws suggests \nthat an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established \ngovernment rules and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and \nregulations is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nApplicant has not provided persuasive evidence showing the current status of his \nFederal income tax filings, and any delinquent amounts owed. In addition, I have no \nevidence regarding Applicant\u2019s current financial status or receipt of any financial \ncounseling. Applicant\u2019s many years of failing to file Federal tax returns when due and \nfailure to pay taxes or arrange a repayment plan with the IRS indicate an inability or \nunwillingness to comply with tax laws. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems have been longstanding and remain a current \nconcern. I am not persuaded that Applicant has a handle on his Federal tax obligations, \nor that he has shown sufficient financial responsibility. I remain doubtful about Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and willingness to voluntarily abide by \ngovernment rules and regulations. \nWhole-Person Concept \n5 \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge \nmust evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality \nof the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d). The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to regain control of his tax filings, and past financial difficulties. \nHowever, Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to show reasonable resolution \nof the SOR concerns and his overall financial responsibility. \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant or \ncontinue eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",
