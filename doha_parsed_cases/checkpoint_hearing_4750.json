The SOR explained why the DCSA CAS was unable to find it \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance \neligibility. The DCSA CAS took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 5, 2023, admitting the allegations, and \nrequesting a hearing. On April 2, 2024, the case was assigned to me. On April 30, 2024, \nDOHA scheduled the hearing for May 30, 2024.The hearing was held as scheduled. I \nreceived four Government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE 4) and nine Applicant exhibits (AE A \u2013 AE I) \nAlso, I received the testimony of Applicant and two character witnesses. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 62-year-old, single man with three children, two of whom are adults. A \nprevious marriage ended in divorce. Applicant earned a high school diploma. He served in \nthe Air Force from 1982 to 1986. He was honorably discharged. (Tr. 22) He enlisted in the \nArmy National Guard in 2004 where he served through 2021. (AE G at 1) He was \nhonorably discharged. \nCurrently, Applicant works in the field of computer network defense, conducting \nvulnerability assessments. (Tr. 22) He has been with the same company, a defense \ncontractor, for nearly four years. Previously, he worked as an intelligence analyst. (Tr. 22) \nHe has held a security clearance since 1994. (Tr. 24) Per a friend, Applicant is a dedicated \nprofessional \u201cwho has always demonstrated a genuine drive to further himself in his ever-\nchanging role as an IT [information technology] specialist.\u201d (AE H, Attachment (Att.) 1) Per \nhis sister, he is very active in his community, and has a strong sense of honesty, integrity, \nreliability, and responsibility. (Att. H at 3) \nThirty-six years ago, in February 1988, Applicant was arrested and charged with \ndriving under the influence (DUI). (Answer at 1) The disposition of the case is unknown \nfrom the record. \nThree years later, in 1991, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. (Answer at \n1) The disposition of the case is unknown from the record. \nOn the evening of January 2, 2021, Applicant met some friends at a local brewpub. \n(Tr. 29) Over the course of two and a half hours, he drank two 16-ounce glasses of beer \nand one eight-ounce glass of beer. (Tr. 26) Applicant left the brewpub at 10:00 pm and \ndrove home. After Applicant arrived at home, he drank three to four shots of whiskey, to \npay homage to loved ones and friends who passed away in the previous year. (Tr. 72) \nThen, he went to bed. \nAt or about 11:00 pm, his son woke him up to tell him that a police officer was at the \ndoor and wanted to talk with him. (Tr. 35) When Applicant went to the door, the police \nofficer told him that he had received a report that a driver in a car matching the description \nand the license plate number of Applicant\u2019s car had been seen hitting another car while \nbacking out of a parking spot at the brewpub parking lot, and leaving without stopping. (Tr. \n54) The officer then asked Applicant if he could take a look at the rear license plate of his \ncar and see if there was any damage. (Tr. 5\n 5) Applicant was perplexed by the allegation \nbecause having backed into the parking spot when he arrived at the brewpub, there was no \nreason to back out when he left the brewpub. (Tr., 55) Nevertheless, he agreed and walked \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noutside to the driveway to inspect the license plate with the officer. After observing \nscratches, the officer walked with Applicant back to the front door. When Applicant walked \nthrough the doorway, the officer blocked the front door with his foot, grabbed him by the \narm, and demanded that he undergo a field sobriety test. (Tr. 38) Applicant refused to take \nthe sobriety test, explaining that it would be an inaccurate reflection of how much alcohol \nwas in his system when he left the brewpub because he had consumed a few drinks after \nhe got home. (Tr. 51, 56) After a heated exchange, the officer arrested Applicant and \ncharged him with DUI, refusing to take a breathalyzer, resisting arrest, and obstruction of \njustice. (GE 2-GE 3) \nThe obstruction charge was dismissed shortly after Applicant was arrested. (GE 4 at \n20)  The remaining charges were bifurcated, with the court adjudicating the DUI case first. \nIn the local district court, a judge heard the case and found Applicant guilty. Applicant then \nexercised his right in the state where the arrest occurred to request a de novo circuit court \njury trial.  \nAt the trial, the state presented the testimony of three customers at the brewpub and \nthe arresting officer. Arguing that the state\u2019s witness\u2019 testimony that Applicant backed into \nthe vehicle was primarily double hearsay and that the arresting police officer unlawfully \nentered Applicant\u2019s house when he arrested him (after the officer admitted on the stand \nthat he made a mistake when he entered Applicant\u2019s home), criminal counsel for Applicant \nmoved for a motion to dismiss the case. (AE A at 10-14) The court granted the motion, \nreasoning that there was no \u201cprima facie element of a lawful arrest\u201d and as such, there was \n\u201cno way a reasonable jury could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (AE \nA at 11, 31, 33) Later, at a pre-trial hearing related to the trial of the charges that the court \nhad previously bifurcated, the state circuit court dismissed the charges, reasoning that the \ncourt was collaterally estopped from moving forward based upon the decision that there \nwas no probable cause in the DUI hearing.(AE A at 34) \nApplicant has not consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication since the January \n2021 arrest. (GE 4 at 5) His alcohol consumption is limited to two or three beers a few \ntimes a month. (GE 4 at 15) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \n3 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness, [and] by its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (AG \u00b6 30) Applicant\u2019s DUI \narrests in1988, 1991, and 2021 trigger the application of AG \u00b6 31(b), \u201cevidence (including, \nbut no limited to, a credible allegation, or an admission, and matters of official record) of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted.\u201d \nAfter a de novo appeal, a state circuit court dismissed the 2021 DUI charge, \nreasoning that there was no requisite probable cause to justify the arrest. Later, the circuit \ncourt dismissed the refusal to take a breathalyzer charge, reasoning that collateral estoppel \napplied vis a vis the decision in the earlier case. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6 32(c), \nno reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense,\u201d applies. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe two previous arrests occurred 33 years ago and 36 years ago, respectively. \nSince then, Applicant served in two branches of the armed services, cultivated a career as \nan intelligence analyst, followed by a career in cybersecurity, and has held a security \nclearance for 30 years. Under these circumstances, \u201cso much time has elapsed since the \ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment,\u201d applies. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the criminal conduct security \nconcern. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nUnder AG \u00b6 21, \u201cexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses and can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nAssuming for the sake of argument that Applicant was not intoxicated when he drove \nhome from the brewpub in January 2021, it is undisputed that he drank three to four shots \nof liquor once he returned home and before he went to bed. Regardless of whether he was \ndrinking to honor deceased relatives, this consumption, combined with the alcohol he drank \nearlier at the brewpub, constituted excessive drinking. When considered together with the \nDUI arrests of 1988 and 1991, the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22 apply: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol-use disorder; \n(c) . . . . binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, \nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol-use disorder; \nApplicant has not drunk to intoxication since January 2021. Per the record evidence, \nApplicant\u2019s most recent alcohol-related episode that preceded the 2021 episode was 30 \nyears ago. Since then, he served honorably in two branches of the armed forces, held a \nsecurity clearance for 30 years, and cultivated careers in two professions. Under these \ncircumstances, AG \u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment,\u201d applies. I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the alcohol consumption security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nGiven the strong record of Applicant\u2019s good character, the infrequency of his alcohol-\nrelated episodes, and the amount of time that has elapsed since the most recent one, I \nconclude that the likelihood of recurrence is minimal. I conclude that Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and the Government\u2019s exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 39 years old, never married, and has no children. He has one living sibling, a sister age 58. He is a high school graduate. Between August 2003 and August 2016, he attended three different periods of classes at one community college and one period of classes at a state college but did not obtain a degree. He has had a cohabitant since July 2021. Since September 2022, he has been employed full-time by a defense contractor. He reported a period of unemployment from January 2020 to September 2021, explained further below. He applied for his security clearance in October 2022. This is his first security clearance application. (Item 3.) The SOR alleged that Applicant had approximately $33,695 of debt from 17 consumer accounts. (Item 1.) He admitted those allegations and explained that most, but not all, of those delinquencies were caused by the death of both of his parents in 2019 and by COVID. In May 2019, his parents were diagnosed with terminal illnesses. The treatment made his mother very ill. That required him to take time off from work without pay to care for her and his father.

On June 20, 2023, following \na background investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. DOD issued the SOR under Executive Order (Exec.

On \nAugust 17, 2023, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 6. On August 23, \n2023, the FORM was mailed to Applicant. Applicant received the FORM on September \n5, 2023. He was afforded an opportunity to note objections and to submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation, and was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to \ndo so. He submitted a response on September 28, 2023 (Response).. Government Items \n1 and 2, the SOR and the Answer, respectively, are the pleadings in the case. Items 3 \nthrough 6 and the Response are admitted without objection. The case was assigned to \nme on January 4, 2024. \nOn February 21, 2024, without objection, I sua sponte reopened the record to allow \nthe parties to submit additional exhibits by close of business March 8, 2024.

He has one living \nsibling, a sister age 58. He is a high school graduate. Between August 2003 and August \n2016, he attended three different periods of classes at one community college and one \nperiod of classes at a state college but did not obtain a degree. He has had a cohabitant \nsince July 2021. Since September 2022, he has been employed full-time by a defense \ncontractor. He reported a period of unemployment from January 2020 to September 2021, \nexplained further below. He applied for his security clearance in October 2022. This is his \nfirst security clearance application. (Item 3.) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had approximately $33,695 of debt from 17 \nconsumer accounts. (Item 1.) He admitted those allegations and explained that most, but \nnot all, of those delinquencies were caused by the death of both of his parents in 2019 \nand by COVID. In May 2019, his parents were diagnosed with terminal illnesses. The \ntreatment made his mother very ill. That required him to take time off from work without \npay to care for her and his father. She died in September 2019 at age 73. At the time, his \nfather was also hospitalized, requiring him to take more time off work. His father died in \nNovember 2019 at age 76. (Items 2 and 3.) \nApplicant needed to take time off work without pay to arrange for his parents\u2019 \nfunerals. He had to handle his parents\u2019 estates. His father also owned several rental \nproperties out of state in addition to some in his home state.

The costs \nof his parents\u2019 funerals, handling their estates, and his father\u2019s rental properties depleted \nwhat little savings he had. The record does not indicate that his older sister assisted him \nfinancially or otherwise with the post-mortem issues. (Item 2.) \nWhen he was able to return to work in September 2021, he found that COVID had \ncaused his position to be eliminated. He had no job to return to. He was forced to take a \nmuch lower paying hourly job from September 2021 to July 2022. It took care of his living \nexpenses but left very little to put toward his debts or savings. In August 2022, he took \npart-time employment until October 2022. In September 2022, he began his current job, \na full-time high paying salaried job. But no income or low income in the past caused him \nto default on some of the SOR accounts. (Item 2.) \nIt appears that Applicant\u2019s period of no income began sometime after his parents\u2019 \nillnesses in May 2019 and their deaths in September and November 2019. That resulted \nin his unemployment in January 2020 until his return to work in a low-paying hourly job in \nSeptember 2021. In September 2022, he resumed a higher paying salaried job. (Item 2.) \nSOR 1.a was charged off for $892 in 2017. (Item 5 at 4; Item 6 at 5.) Applicant \nstated in his SCA that he began having financial trouble with this credit card in 2016, and \nthat it closed without being paid. (Item 3 at 7.) In his personal subject interview (PSI), he \nverified his SCA information. (Item 4 at 2.) His Response said the account was removed \nfrom his credit report as of September 15, 2023. (Response at 3.) This account is not \nreported on GE 7. \nSOR \u00b61.b was placed for collection for $702 in 2021. (Item 5 at 4; Item 6 at 5.) \nApplicant stated in his SCA that he began having financial trouble with this credit card in \nJuly 2021, and that it closed without being paid. (Item 45-46.) In his PSI, he verified his \nSCA information. (Item 4 at 3.) In his Response, he said that he defaulted on this account, \nafter he lost his income in 2020. He also said he settled this account with a discounted \npayment of $282 on September 21, 2023, and attached a receipt. (Response at 3, 11.) \nThis SOR debt has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b61.c was placed for collection for $876 in 2019. (Item 5 at 5; Item 6 at 5.) \nApplicant stated in his SCA that he began having financial issues with this credit card in \n2019. (Item 5 at 5; Item 6 at 5.) In his Answer, he stated that he defaulted on this account, \nafter he lost his income in 2020. His Response said the account was removed from his \ncredit report on September 15, 2023. (Response at 3.) \nGE 7 reports on an account Applicant opened on December 17, 2023, with the \nsame creditor identified in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.b and 1.c.

Applicant stated in his SCA that his financial issues with this \nvehicle began in 2019 when he had to take leave to care for his parents. (Item 3 at 42-\n43.) In his Answer, he said that he was current for several years before his parents died. \nHis loss of income in 2020 after their death forced him to surrender the auto to the creditor. \nIn his Response, he said he contacted the creditor on September 1, 2023, and was told \nit could not accept any payments and referred him to the collection agency. He contacted \nthat agency on several occasions and left messages. It has not returned his calls.    \nSOR \u00b61.e is the balance ($2,012) of an auto loan that was repossessed in 2019. \n(Item 5 at 5; Item 6 at 8.) In his Answer, Applicant said he was making payments for \nseveral years and was current until his parents died. When he lost his income in 2020, he \nwas forced to surrender the auto to the creditor. In his Response, he said he contacted \nthe creditor on September 1, 2023, and was told it could not accept any payments and \nreferred him to the collection agency. He contacted that agency on several occasions and \nleft phone messages. It has not returned his calls. \nAs noted, the two above auto debts are owed to the same creditor. GE 7 reports \nthe auto loans twice. First, they are both reported as: \u201cAuto Repossessions,\u201d \u201cOpened\u201d \nJune 2015 and June 2016, and zero \u201cPast Due.\u201d They have identical account numbers. \n(GE 7 at 5-6.) Second, in the same credit report, two auto loans are reported as: \u201cAuto,\u201d \n\u201cOpened\u201d July 2015, \u201cPays account as agreed,\u201d \u201cClosed Or Paid Account/zero Balance,\u201d \nand zero \u201cPast Due.\u201d These two latter accounts have the same account numbers as the \nfirst two SOR auto accounts discussed above. (GE 7 at 10.) The record indicates that \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e are not delinquent. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f was charged off for $11,726 in 2021. (Item 5 at 6; Item 6 at 3.) In his \nAnswer, Applicant said this was a joint line of credit with his mother. After she died, it \ndefaulted and became a claim against her estate. In his Response, he said he contacted \nthe creditor on September 1, 2023, and was told it could not accept any payments and \nreferred him to the collection agency. He contacted it on several occasions and left phone \nmessages. It has not returned his calls. \nIn his Response to GE 7, Applicant reported his additional attempted contacts with \nthe collection agency for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. He contacted it by phone on September \n22, 25, and 29, 2023, on October 1, 2023, on December 11, 2023, and on March 7, 2024. \nHe got only prompts to leave messages, which he did. He has not received any return \ncalls. He also contacted an accredited debt relief company but was told it could not assist \nhim. He would very much like to settle these three accounts and will continue to contact \nthe collection agency and seek help from other third-party companies. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g was charged off in 2016.

In his Answer, \nApplicant said this was his mother\u2019s credit card, and he was an authorized user. After she \ndied, the account defaulted and was claimed against her estate. In his SCA, he said he \nbegan having financial issues with this account in June 2019, due to caring for his parents. \n(Item 3 at 40.)

As the \nSupreme Court has noted, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nAnalysis  \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe followings conditions are applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nExcept for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h., the SOR debts are established by Applicant's \nadmissions and the Government's credit reports. Therefore, AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) \napply. The next inquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft),  . . divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances); and \n(d)  the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n7 \n\n \n \n \n I have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a). The circumstances that \ngave rise to Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties began with the simultaneous diagnoses \nof the terminal illnesses of both of his aging parents in May 2019. Those diagnoses \ncaused Applicant to take time off from work without pay to care for them. That care-\ngiver role ended in the fall, when his mother and father died in September and \nNovember 2019, respectively. Given that their fatal diagnoses were in May and their \ndeaths only several months apart that same year, it is fair to infer that their deaths \nwere unexpected.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s post-mortem tasks, however, continued to absorb his time. He had \nto arrange for all the details that normally come from the death of a parent. In this \ncase, however, with back-to-back deaths, those funeral details likely were more \nonerous. Having taken more time off from work without pay and exhausted his FMLA \nleave, by January 2020, he needed to apply for unemployment. That was occasioned \nby his need to take care of his parents\u2019 estates. Another complication was that his \nfather owned several rental properties, some out of state and some in his home state. \nThose properties needed to be attended to because of his father\u2019s death. \nDealing with two funerals, two estates, and a number of rental properties did \nnot just consume much of Applicant\u2019s time and employability. It also had adverse \nfinancial repercussions. Two funerals, two estates, and numerous rental properties \ncaused unexpected costs that depleted what little savings he had. He contracted \nCOVID sometime in 2020. When he was able to return to work in September 2021, \nhe found that his position had been eliminated by COVID. He had no job to return to. \nFrom September 2021 to July 2022, he was forced to take a much lower-paying \nhourly job, one that took care of living expenses but left very little to put towards debts \nor savings. Having no income or low income in the past caused him to fall behind on \nsome of the SOR debts. After a brief stint in a part-time job from August 2022 to \nSeptember 2022, he returned to a full-time higher paying salaried job. \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s period of no income began not long after his parents\u2019 \nillnesses in May 2019 and their deaths in the fall of 2019. That continued into early \n2020. His period of unemployment, thus no income or low income, began in January \n2020 until he took a low-paying hourly job in September 2021. It was not until \nSeptember 2022 that he resumed a full-time higher paying salaried job. Just a month \nlater, in October 2022 he completed his SCA, thus beginning his security clearance \nprocess. \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a). An unexpected double \ndeath of aging parents, the concomitant two funerals and two estates, paternally-\nowned rental properties, related unemployment, a pandemic-caused job loss, and \nunderemployment are circumstances highly unlikely to recur. Those circumstances \nbore directly and adversely on Applicant\u2019s financial condition. Applicant\u2019s \u201ccurrent \nreliability\u201d is addressed below in the discussion of his responsible conduct under AG \n\u00b6 20(b). I find that his current reliability is not at all doubtful. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s time away from work was initially caused by his parents\u2019 diagnoses \nwith terminal illness in May 2019. He did not resume a full-time salaried position until \nSeptember 2022. Between those two dates, the following SOR debts were charged \noff, placed for collection, or in default due to: (1) unemployment; (2) loss of income; \n(3) low income; (4) a claim against an estate; (5) the non-responsiveness of a \ncollection agency or its refusal to accept payments; or (6) the account was current \nbefore his parents died:  \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, through 1.l and 1.n, through 1.q. debts are mitigated under AG \u00b6 \n20(a). \nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b) warrants discussion. That condition has two \nrequirements. First, the circumstances causing Applicant\u2019s financial problems must \nhave been \u201clargely beyond\u201d his control. Second, he must have acted responsibly in \nlight of the obstacles he faced. Here, the circumstances he confronted were without \na doubt beyond his control, thus satisfying the first requirement. \nThe next question is whether Applicant acted responsibly (and reliably) under \nthe adversity he faced. Looking at the multi-faceted burdens of the illness and deaths \nof both parents, he took the time necessary to address those burdens. He took time \noff work without pay. He went on unemployment. Then came COVID, a lost job \nposition, and a year of underemployment. He resumed salaried employment in \nSeptember 2022, just a month before he started his security clearance process. He \ndid not have a great deal of time to get his finances in order. So, it was inevitable that \nmuch of his financial remedial efforts came after the SOR was issued. The foregoing \ndebt-by-debt analysis shows that he made numerous attempts to contact creditors and \ncollection agencies to satisfy SOR debts. I do not find that he was \u201cgaming\u201d the security \nclearance process. This was, in fact, his first foray into that process. I find that he \nacted responsibly (and reliably) and that AG \u00b6 20(b) applies to mitigate the same \ndebts mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(a). \nApplicant produced a receipt showing he resolved SOR \u00b6 1.b by paying a \ndiscounted amount on September 21, 2023. This debt is mitigated under AG 20 \u00b6 (d). \nA careful reading of the credit reports indicates that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c is not \ndelinquent. The Government has not established its case. \nA careful reading of the credit reports indicates that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, and 1.e. are \nnot delinquent. The Government has not established its case. \nThe Government observed correctly that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h were charged off \nin 2016 and 2017, respectively, before Applicant\u2019s parents were diagnosed with \nterminal illnesses. Although he admitted the allegations, the SOR does not allege an \namount owed or that the accounts were delinquent. The Government has not \nestablished its case. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nThe Government observed correctly that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.m were charged \noff in 2017 and 2016, respectively, before Applicant\u2019s parents were diagnosed with \nterminal illnesses in 2019. Thus, their illnesses could not have adversely affected him \nfinancially. Those two debts, however, total $1,408 and do not pose national security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with no questions about his eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has provided sufficient evidence \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.q: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant access to classified information.

He received a high \nschool diploma in 1981. He has been married and divorced three times (1983-1993, \n1996-1998, and 1998-2011). He has three adult children. (Items 3, 5) \nOn various occasions between 1985 and August 2020, Applicant consumed \nalcohol in excess and drove while intoxicated. He was arrested and charged with driving \nunder the influence of alcohol (DUI) on four occasions during that time. Police arrested \nhim and charged him with DUI in May 1985, March 1994, October 1997, and August \n2020.

(Items 3-6) \nIn March 2023, a licensed clinical psychologist (Psychologist) interviewed \nApplicant via telemedicine after reviewing unspecified documents from the DOD. During \ntheir interview, they discussed his four DUI charges and his drinking history, and he \ntook a screening test to measure hazardous drinking behavior (on which he scored 9 \nout of 12, with a score of 4 or more indicating hazardous drinking in men). In her June \n2023 report, the Psychologist opined that he \u201clikely meets the criteria for a diagnosis of \nalcohol use disorder.\u201d She also noted that the documents she reviewed showed no \nevidence of previous diagnosis or treatment for his condition. (Items 4, 5) \nApplicant denied that he drinks and drives after his August 2020 arrest, and the \nPsychologist noted that his stable employment history with the same company for about \n39 years tends to show that his drinking is not interfering with his occupational \nfunctioning. She opined that his alcohol use does not appear to be interfering with his \ncurrent daily functioning, and that \u201cthere is not an indication of significant concern \nrelated to his judgment, reliability, stability, or trustworthiness.\u201d He reiterated these \npoints in his SOR response, referencing his \u201cexcellent work history,\u201d and his lack of \nunderstanding why he is in danger of losing his clearance nearly three years after his \nlast DUI.

(Items 4-6) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder.  \nApplicant was arrested and charged with DUIs in 1985, 1994, 1997, and 2020, \nafter drinking too much and driving. In June 2023, a licensed clinical psychologist \nopined that he likely met the criteria for an alcohol use disorder. The above-referenced \ndisqualifying conditions are established, and the burden shifts to Applicant to provide \nevidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nOn at least four occasions, Applicant consumed too much alcohol, drove a \nvehicle while under the influence of alcohol, and was arrested for DUI. Although it has \nbeen almost four years since Applicant\u2019s most recent alcohol-related arrest, his pattern \nof impaired driving with significant gaps between alcohol-related incidents means I will \nnot find that this behavior is unlikely to recur. His lack of awareness that he consumes \ntoo much alcohol, his unwillingness to modify the amount of his alcohol consumption, \nand his \u201cpoor\u201d prognosis further cement my doubts and tend to show that he exhibits \npoor judgment. For these reasons, he has not met his burden to show that the behavior \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. He also has not met his burden of showing that he has demonstrated a clear \nand established pattern of modified consumption. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(b) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude he did not \nmitigate the alcohol consumption security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SCA and Answer are sufficient to raise the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 25: \n (a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \nIn October 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued a memorandum \nentitled \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d (2014 DNI Memo) which \nmakes clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the various states, \nterritories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the existing National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines, and that Federal law supersedes state laws on this issue: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines. . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the use, \nsale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe 2021 DNI memo specifically notes that \u201cunder policy set forth in SEAD 4's \nadjudicative guidelines, the illegal use or misuse of controlled substances can raise \nsecurity concerns about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness to access classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive position, as well as their ability or willingness to comply \nwith laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d Thus, consistent with these references, the AGs \nindicate that \u201cdisregard of federal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but not \ndeterminative, to adjudications of eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility \nto hold a sensitive position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo.)   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has cited the 2014 DNI memo in holding that \u201cstate laws \nallowing for the legal use of marijuana in some limited circumstances do not preempt \nprovisions of the Industrial Security Program, and the Department of Defense is not bound \nby the status of an applicant\u2019s conduct under state law when adjudicating that individual\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-03734 at 3-4 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 18, 2016).  \nThe current National Security Adjudicative Guidelines went into effect on June 8, \n2017, after the 2014 DNI memo was issued. Nevertheless, the principle continues to \napply. \nMoreover, on December 21, 2021, DNI Avril D. Haynes issued a memorandum \nentitled, \u201cSecurity Executive Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) The memo \nincorporates the AGs (at reference B) and the 2014 DNI memo (at reference G) among \nvarious other relevant Federal laws, executive orders, and memoranda. I take \nadministrative notice of the 2021 DNI memo here, given its relevance to this case, its \nreliance on the AGs, and its recency.  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 26: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: (1) \n5 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is established for SOR \u00b6 1.a. There is no evidence in the record that \nApplicant understood his use to be problematic at the time and there was no evidence to \nthe contrary. It was over a limited period to help him sleep. He had never held a security \nclearance and had stopped months prior to his SCA being submitted. The Appeal Board \nhas noted that: \nApplicants cannot be expected to be constitutional law experts or versed in \nthe concept of Federal supremacy. The ambiguity between state and \nFederal drug laws and the ensuing confusion was addressed by the \nSecurity Executive Agent in December 2021 in \u201cClarifying Guidance \nConcerning Marijuana for Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons \nProposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position\u201d (SecEA Clarifying Guidance). Relevant to the \ntopic of notice, the Guidance encourages employers \u201cto advise prospective \nnational security workforce employees that they should refrain from any \nfuture marijuana use upon initiation of the national security vetting process, \nwhich commences once the individual signs the certification contained in \nthe [SCA].\u201d SecEA Guidance at 2. Implicit in this guidance is the recognition \nthat the SCA itself no longer puts applicants on notice and that employers \nshould affirmatively be providing notice to prospective employees. The \nSecEA\u2019s guidance to employers, however, cannot be presumed to have \nbeen followed. See ISCR Case No. 23-02476 at 5 (App. Bd. May 1, 2024). \nApplicant\u2019s prior use of marijuana for sleeping does not raise questions about his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. His subsequent actions after \nlearning of the issue reflect his reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, or regulations. See ISCR Case No. 20-02974 at 6 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 1, 2022). \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is established for SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant voluntarily disclosed his actions \non his SCA. He fully acknowledges his past actions. He swore to his intention to never \ntake any gummies or use any marijuana products in the future. His Answer reflects his \nunderstanding that any future involvement in marijuana is grounds for revocation of a \nsecurity clearance. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant's admissions and \nexplanations, including his explanation for why he started using marijuana. Applicant\u2019s \nresponses in his SCA, security interview, and Answer regarding his marijuana \ninvolvement reflect his recognition that he must not use marijuana even if it is legal for \nuse in his state. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline \nH and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the security concerns raised by his drug involvement. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR  APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a: \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

She was previously married and divorced three times. She currently lives alone and has three adult children. From 2014 until October 2021, she was employed as a ride-share driver. She was also employed as an insurance agent from March 2021 to March 2022. Since March 2022, she has worked for a federal contractor as an inbound call representative. She was also simultaneously employed as a travel agent until December 2022 when she voluntarily resigned her position, which accounted for 40% of her income. In June 2024, she resumed her occupation as a ride-share driver. Her employment with a federal contractor requires that she be granted trustworthiness eligibility for a public trust position. (GE 1; Tr. 23-33) Financial Considerations Applicant attributed her delinquent debts due to her illness, multiple surgeries, and other health issues that occurred in approximately the 2020-to-2022 time period.

Applicant admitted this debt in her SOR \nresponse, and she stated that she has no plan in place to pay this account. This \ndelinquent debt remains unresolved. (Tr. 49-50; SOR response) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges that Applicant is indebted to a credit union for a closed checking \naccount with a deficit balance of $675. She testified that the credit union has asked her \nto appear for a handwriting analysis. She has been unable to complete this request since \nthe credit union is located in another state. She plans to visit the credit union in September \n2024. Applicant did not provide supporting documentation and this delinquent debt \nremains unresolved. (Tr. 50-52; SOR response) \nSOR \u00b6 1.m alleges that Applicant is indebted to a creditor for a delinquent car loan \nin the amount of $6,290. She stated the car was purchased in about 2018, and the vehicle \nwas deemed to be a \u201clemon\u201d due to multiple transmission problems. The creditor told her \nto return the car, and she would be held harmless for the balance of the car loan. \nHowever, during her May 2022 background interview, Applicant provided a different \nbackground story about the car being totaled after her friend driving the car was involved \nin an accident. During the hearing Applicant was unsure which car was attributed to this \nSOR allegation since she had purchased three cars from this creditor. She would \nresearch the matter and provide documentation while the record was held open. Applicant \ndid not provide supporting documentation, and this delinquent debt remains unresolved. \n(Tr. 54-61; GE 2; SOR response) \nApplicant testified at the hearing that her current financial situation is not improving. \nShe recently took out a hardship loan from her retirement account, and her current \npaychecks are reduced until the hardship loan is repaid. She essentially lives paycheck \nto paycheck, and she considers her present financial standing as \u201cbad.\u201d She does believe \nat some point in the future her financial situation will improve.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the \nGovernment establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden \nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the Government. An applicant has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly \nconsistent with national security to grant or continue eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that may raise financial considerations trustworthiness concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f), \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nThe following financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAfter the Government presents evidence raising a trustworthiness concern under \nGuideline F, the burden then shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. \nApplicant attributed her financial delinquencies to her illness, multiple surgeries, \nand other health issues that occurred in approximately the 2020-to-2022 time period.

There is no evidence that she has made any payments or initiated \ncommunication with any of her delinquent creditors to establish payment plans. She had \na payment plan established with the IRS for her delinquent 2020 federal taxes, but she \nhas not made consistent payments in accordance with her payment plan. There is no \ncurrent payment plan established. She testified that her current financial standing is not \ngood, as she lives from paycheck to paycheck. She has not demonstrated that she acted \nresponsibly to address her financial delinquencies. There are not clear indications that \nher finances are under control. Under all the circumstances, Applicant has not met her \nburden of presenting evidence of extenuation or mitigation to overcome the financial \nconsiderations trustworthiness concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuideline F are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Applicant did not \nprovide any evidence of payments, payment plans, or other actions to resolve the 13 \ndelinquent debts alleged in the SOR. She has been unable to resolve her unpaid 2020 \nfederal taxes. Her actions show a lack of financial responsibility and good judgment and \nraise unmitigated questions about her reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nsensitive information. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible for a \nposition of trust. The determination of an individual\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \ntrustworthiness position is not a once in a lifetime occurrence, but is based on applying \nthe factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. Under her \ncurrent circumstances, a position of trust is not warranted. In the future, she may well \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of her trustworthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in the Directive, and the AGs, to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude that financial \nconsideration trustworthiness concerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \npublic trust position.

The Government timely provided a document that I \nmarked for identification purposes as Item 10, consisting of a summary of Applicant\u2019s \nOctober 4, 2022, and October 5, 2022, personal subject interviews. Applicant did not \nprovide any documents, and he did not object to the entry of Item 10 into the record. \nThe Government exhibits included in the FORM (Items 1-10) are therefore admitted in \nevidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor for whom he has \nworked since December 2021. He received a high school diploma in June 2015. He was \nmarried from March 2017 until his divorce in June 2021. He has no children. He served \non active duty with the U.S. Navy from October 2016 until March 2021, when he was \nadministratively separated for misconduct with a general discharge under honorable \nconditions (Items 4-7, 10) \nFrom about June 2019 until about December 2019, while he was on active duty \nwith the Navy, Applicant used, purchased, possessed, and distributed lysergic acid \ndiethylamide (LSD). At all times relevant to this investigation, LSD has been a controlled \nsubstance and its possession (and therefore its use) and distribution have been illegal. \nWhile there is evidence that he was granted security clearance eligibility, there is \ninsufficient evidence to demonstrate that he had access to classified or sensitive \ninformation while he was involved with an illegal drug. (Response to SOR; Items 4, 6-\n10) \nDuring this time, while he was a sailor with the U.S. Navy, Applicant purchased \nLSD via social media and provided it to other sailors. In early 2020, the U.S. Naval \nCriminal Investigative Service (NCIS) began an investigation into Applicant and his \npossible illegal activities. The NCIS investigation included interviews with Applicant and \nseveral individuals that obtained LSD from him. During the investigation, Applicant \nadmitted the aforementioned illegal conduct involving LSD, telling investigators that he \nbegan using LSD in the summer of 2019 because he was depressed by his lack of \ncommand recognition, his pending divorce, and the passing of some of his friends. He \nalso admitted to NCIS investigators that he acted as a \u201cmiddleman\u201d for other \nservicemembers by purchasing four to five doses of LSD from someone via social \nmedia on six or seven occasions and then distributing it to fellow sailors. An NCIS \nsearch of the text messages on Applicant\u2019s cellular phone led to interviews with some of \nthese other sailors. One of these sailors acknowledged that Applicant had provided him \nwith the LSD. (Items 4, 6-10) \nAfter NCIS concluded its investigation, Applicant was charged with violating \nArticle 112a (wrongful possession, manufacture, or distribution of a controlled \nsubstance) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). After a Captain\u2019s Mast, \nApplicant was found guilty of violating Article 112a by a preponderance of the evidence. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHis commanding officer awarded him a reduction in rank, restriction and extra duty for \n45 days, and forfeiture of one-half of his pay for two months. Applicant was advised of \nhis appeal rights, but he affirmatively waived them. The Navy administratively separated \nApplicant for misconduct, as referenced above. During the Navy administrative \nseparation process, he was afforded the right to consult with counsel and submit a \nwritten statement for consideration, but he affirmatively waived those rights. (SOR \nResponse; Items 4, 6-10) \nDespite admitting his 2019 illegal drug involvement to NCIS investigators, \nApplicant certified in his February 2022 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) that he had not illegally used any drugs or controlled substances in \nthe last seven years. He also certified that he had not been involved in the illegal \npurchase, manufacture, cultivation, trafficking, production, transfer, shipping, receiving, \nhandling or sale of any drug or controlled substance. Instead, as an optional comment, \nhe wrote that he had been \u201c\u2026 accused of using a controlled substance because of a \ngroup text message, but I did not fail a drug test for a controlled substance.\u201d (Items 4, 6, \n7) \nDuring an October 2022 security interview with an authorized DOD investigator, \nApplicant again minimized the full extent of his 2019 illegal drug involvement. He \nclaimed that he tried to purchase LSD but was unsuccessful in doing so. He also \nclaimed that he briefly possessed LSD that a friend of his purchased, but he threw it \naway without using it. He claimed that he never used or sold LSD. Initially, he told the \nDOD investigator that he had not told NCIS investigators that he used LSD. (SOR \nResponse; Items 4, 6, 7, 10) \nThe following day, in an October 5, 2022 affidavit, Applicant swore that he tried to \npurchase LSD but was unsuccessful. He reiterated that he never used LSD and only \npossessed it in his home briefly before throwing it away. He also changed his story from \nthe day before and told the DOD investigator that he did tell NCIS investigators that he \nused LSD, because he thought he could easily disprove his use through a clean drug \ntest. He maintained that he did not tell NCIS investigators that he purchased LSD. \n(Items 4, 6-10) \nI find that Applicant is being untruthful about the full scope of his drug \ninvolvement because of the following: he changed his narrative during the security \nclearance process about what he admitted to NCIS investigators; if he had not used \nLSD, he lied to NCIS investigators about his use; his alleged basis for telling NCIS \ninvestigators that he used LSD when he had not defies logic; a witness corroborated \nportions of his LSD involvement that he now denies; and the unrebutted presumption \nthat the NCIS officials and his commanding officer were acting in good faith in carrying \nout their duties when they investigated his drug involvement and found him guilty of the \nbroader drug misconduct, including its use, respectively. (Response to SOR; Items 4, 6-\n10) \nDuring his security interviews and in his affidavit, Applicant claimed he did not \nhire a lawyer for assistance or appeal his punishment because the \u201cyeoman\u201d led him to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbelieve that it would not be worth it to do either.

Without providing documentary corroboration, he alleged \nthat he had negative results from a March 2021 urinalysis drug test and an October or \nNovember 2021 hair follicle drug test. Despite the over two years that passed after his \nalleged LSD use, he claimed that any such use in 2019 would have been revealed by \nthe hair follicle test. (SOR Response; Items 6-10) \nIn his SOR Response, Applicant denied the allegations in the SOR except for the \nlone Guideline J allegation relating to him receiving non-judicial punishment for violation \nof Article 112a of the UCMJ, which he admitted. His admission is incorporated in my \nfindings of fact. He provided narrative statements in his SOR Response in relation to the \nGuideline E SOR allegations. He largely reiterated what he told the DOD investigator on \nthe second day of his security interview and what he wrote in his sworn affidavit, as I \nnoted above. He admitted he made a mistake by briefly possessing LSD and having \nhad an intent to use it, on which he ultimately did not act. (SOR Response; Items 6-10) \nApplicant claimed he contemplated using LSD because he was depressed and \nhas since been able to manage his depression. He misses the military, enjoys his job, \nand claimed he has never let his personal life affect his professional life. He claimed he \ntold the DOD investigator the truth to the best of his knowledge and has passed multiple \ndrug tests. (SOR Response; Items 6-10) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant illegally used, possessed, and distributed LSD with varying frequency \nin 2019. AG \u00b6 25(a) and AG \u00b6 25(c) are established. While there is evidence that \nApplicant had security clearance eligibility while he was involved with LSD, there is no \nevidence that he was granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive \nposition. SOR \u00b6 1.c is not established and I find in Applicant\u2019s favor with respect to that \nallegation. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nIt has been about four and one-half years since Applicant was involved with \nillegal drugs or controlled substances. The circumstances surrounding his LSD \ninvolvement were to alleviate symptoms of depression because his career was not \ngoing well and because he was going through a divorce. He now enjoys his job, is years \nremoved from his divorce, and is receiving appropriate treatment from the VA. His LSD \ninvolvement only occurred over a relatively short period. Given this period of \nabstinence, and because the circumstances that led to his LSD use are no longer \npresent, I find that his period of abstinence since December 2019 is sufficient to show \nthat it is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 26(a) applies. AG \u00b6 26(b) does not apply because \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant has not acknowledged the full extent of his drug involvement and substance \nmisuse. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThere is substantial evidence that, in 2019, Applicant used, possessed, and \ndistributed an illegal drug. After an NCIS investigation where he admitted this criminal \nbehavior to NCIS investigators, his commanding officer found that he committed these \nacts and violated Article 112a of the UCMJ by a preponderance of the evidence. The \nabove referenced disqualifying condition is established, thereby shifting the burden to \nApplicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAs it has been about four and one-half years since Applicant was involved with \nillegal drugs, it would appear that a significant amount of time has passed since he \nengaged in criminal behavior. However, as I found that he was being untruthful about \nthe full scope of his illegal drug involvement, he lied about a material fact relevant to a \nsecurity clearance adjudication. Falsifying material information in a security clearance \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nadjudication is a criminal offense under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001. Therefore, Applicant has \ncontinued to engage in criminal behavior, undercutting his efforts at mitigation under AG \n\u00b6 32(a) and AG \u00b6 32(d), which require the passage of time without recurrence of \ncriminal acts. Given the recency of his criminal activity, AG \u00b6 32(a) and AG \u00b6 32(d) do \nnot apply. AG \u00b6 32(c) does not apply because there is reliable evidence of his illegal \ndrug involvement in the form of credible allegations from the NCIS investigation and the \nCaptain\u2019s Mast findings. None of the Guideline J mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other government official. \nApplicant deliberately omitted the full extent of his illegal drug involvement on his \ne-QIP. In October 2022, he lied to a DOD-authorized investigator, and he lied in a sworn \naffidavit. Both of the above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant's case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nApplicant did not correct his omission or concealment of his illegal LSD \ninvolvement prior to being confronted with the facts. Instead, he continues to \nmisrepresent the full extent of this involvement. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. \nDeliberately omitting required information and lying to DOD investigators is not \nminor. Instead, these actions strike at the heart of the security clearance process, which \nrelies on candid and honest reporting. Applicant engaged in this deceitful and \nmisleading activity multiple times and continues to do so. Therefore, he has not shown \nthat his behavior was infrequent, happened under unique circumstances, or is unlikely \nto recur. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \nApplicant has not acknowledged his dishonest behavior. Moreover, for the \nreasons I provided in my analysis of AG \u00b6 17(c), I cannot find his behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. AG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply. None of the Guideline E mitigating conditions are \napplicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nGuidelines H, J, and E in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered Applicant\u2019s \nmilitary service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude he mitigated the \ndrug involvement and substance misuse security concerns. He did not mitigate the \ncriminal conduct and personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 3.b-3.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 43 years old. After graduating high school in 1998 he attended some college but did not receive a degree. He has been self-employed since 2003. He is being sponsored by a defense contractor for his security clearance. (Item 3 at 8-13, 22.) SOR \u00b6 1.a: An account placed for collection in the amount of $58,620. Applicant denies the debt. He states in his Answer that he did lease property from the creditor and that during the COVID pandemic he did relinquish property to the creditor \u201cfree and clear with no debt owed to them.\u201d He did not offer any documentary evidence in corroboration or support of his Answer. When he was confronted with the debt during his security clearance interview in September 2022, he acknowledged it was a warehouse he had leased but stated he did not have an outstanding balance when he completed his lease and was unaware of any outstanding balance.

FORM Items 3 through 6 \nare admitted into evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.b and denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c with explanations. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 43 years old. After graduating high school in 1998 he attended some \ncollege but did not receive a degree. He has been self-employed since 2003. He is being \nsponsored by a defense contractor for his security clearance. (Item 3 at 8-13, 22.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: An account placed for collection in the amount of $58,620. Applicant \ndenies the debt. He states in his Answer that he did lease property from the creditor and \nthat during the COVID pandemic he did relinquish property to the creditor \u201cfree and clear \nwith no debt owed to them.\u201d He did not offer any documentary evidence in corroboration \nor support of his Answer. When he was confronted with the debt during his security \nclearance interview in September 2022, he acknowledged it was a warehouse he had \nleased but stated he did not have an outstanding balance when he completed his lease \nand was unaware of any outstanding balance. He did not reference the COVID pandemic \nduring the interview. His July 2022 credit report lists the debt as placed for collection, with \nthe date assigned as October 2021, and a balance of $55,546. The debt is not listed on \nhis May 2023 credit report. (Item 4 at 3; Item 5; Item 6 at 2.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: An auto loan placed for collection in the amount of $9,566. Applicant \nadmits the debt. He states in his Answer he was informed it was charged off and \nprocessed and \u201ccould not be re-opened.\u201d During his security clearance interview he told \nthe investigator that the debt arose from a truck he purchased for work. When it broke \ndown in 2022, he stopped making payments. (Item 6 at 3.) The debt is reflected in Item \n5. He did offer to the investigator a letter showing he had paid in full an account with this \ncreditor. However, there is no amount listed and the account numbers do not match. (Item \n4 at 3.) Another account listed with this creditor does reflect it was closed with no \noutstanding financial obligations. (Item 4 at 4.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: A medical account placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$1,131. Applicant denies the debt. He states in his Answer the debt should have been \ncovered by insurance. The debt arose from an accident and the company never \ncompleted the coverage. He stated he was unaware the account existed. He did not offer \nany documentary evidence in corroboration or support of his claim that the debt was or \nshould be covered by insurance.

He \ndiscussed this deb and also why he withdrew his Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing with the \ninvestigator. He attributed his financial difficulties to a work slowdown due to the COVID \npandemic. (Item 3 at 24; Item 4 at 2; Item 6 at 2.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nApplicant accrued delinquent debts. His admissions and the evidence in the FORM \nestablish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances.  \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing and \nunresolved. He offered no evidence, aside from the general statement that the COVID \npandemic impacted him, for consideration in deciding whether his overall reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment should mitigate these financial problems. \nApplicant attributes his debts to the COVID pandemic. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) \ntherefore applies. For full consideration under AG \u00b6 20(b), however, Applicant must \nestablish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He has not done so. He \ncompleted his SCA in June 2022 and was interviewed in September 2022. He \nacknowledged he had leased the property alleged in the SOR but did not offer any \nevidence to support his claim he did not have an outstanding balance when he completed \nhis lease. He admitted the loan alleged in the SOR and that he stopped making payments \non the loan when his vehicle when it broke down. The most recent record evidence (May \n2023 credit report) shows no action on the medical debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nwho waits until his clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the \njudgment expected of those with access to classified information. See ISCR Case No. \n16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) citing ISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, \n2017). He did not provide any evidence that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances to resolve them. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Because Applicant requested a determination \non the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and \nsincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, \n2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the four debts in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a -1.d) with explanations and two narrative statements. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. Additional findings follow. Applicant is 48 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2013 and briefly attended another college in 2016. He is now pursuing a master\u2019s degree. After two years in the National Guard (1993-1995) he served for over 23 years on active duty in the Army as a military policeman (1995-2018). He deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. He was discharged honorably as a sergeant first class (E-7). After leaving the Army, he was unemployed for about a year. He worked as a military police instructor from August 2019 to September 2020. When that contract ended, he was again unemployed from October 2020 until November 2021. Since then, he has been employed as a trainer in a manufacturing plant for his current employer and clearance sponsor. His only marriage (2000 to 2019) ended in divorce. He has a son and a daughter, both in their 20s. He had a clearance in the Army, most recently granted in 2016. He lives in State 1.

The case \nwas assigned to me on May 22, 2024. On June 5, 2024, following consultation with the \nparties, DOHA issued a notice scheduling the hearing for June 17, 2024. The hearing \nwas to take place virtually through an online platform. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel submitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6. Applicant testified and submitted documents he \nmarked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through N. All of the exhibits were admitted without \nobjection. I left the record open until July 31, 2024, to allow Applicant the opportunity to \nsubmit additional information. On June 28, 2024, the day after the hearing, he submitted \nexhibits regarding his debt resolution efforts (AE O, AE P), a letter from the Department \nof Veterans Affairs (VA) regarding his benefits (AE Q), a 1994 document regarding a prior \nclearance (AE R), his DD-214 certificate of discharge from active duty (AE S), and \ndocumentation of numerous decorations, medals, citations, and certificates.

(Tr. 11-13) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the four debts in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a -1.d) with explanations and \ntwo narrative statements. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. \nAdditional findings follow. \nApplicant is 48 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2013 and briefly \nattended another college in 2016. He is now pursuing a master\u2019s degree. After two years \nin the National Guard (1993-1995) he served for over 23 years on active duty in the Army \nas a military policeman (1995-2018). He deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. He was \ndischarged honorably as a sergeant first class (E-7). After leaving the Army, he was \nunemployed for about a year. He worked as a military police instructor from August 2019 \nto September 2020. When that contract ended, he was again unemployed from October \n2020 until November 2021. Since then, he has been employed as a trainer in a \nmanufacturing plant for his current employer and clearance sponsor. His only marriage \n(2000 to 2019) ended in divorce. He has a son and a daughter, both in their 20s. He had \na clearance in the Army, most recently granted in 2016. He lives in State 1.

(GE 1 at 38-40; GE 2 at 6-8) The four \nSOR debts total about $66,788. They are established by credit reports in the record, from \nJune 2022, April 2023, and June 2024. (GE 3, GE 4, GE 6) \nApplicant asserted in his Answer that his debts are due to his divorce, his \nretirement, and family members needing to move in with him. He said he acted in the best \ninterests of his family. He was assigned to a base in State 2 in 2015, when he and his \nwife decided to divorce. He had plans to finance his retirement with real estate \ninvestments. His wife did not know about his purchases at the time. He was paying for \ntwo mortgages and an apartment, as well as other living expenses. He was the only \nperson on the deeds and found he could not afford them. The judge in the divorce \nproceedings froze his retirement assets so he could not borrow against them to pay the \ndebt. His divorce lawyer was also expensive and he could not afford to repair the rental \napartment. He also asserted that most of the marital debts were assigned to him. (GE 5 \nat 7; Answer; Tr. 34-36, 87-88, 94-96) \nApplicant provided his 2019 divorce decree and judgment and related documents, \nincluding a parenting plan, a child support order, and documentation of his military pay \nand TSP retirement funds. (AE A-E) Applicant sought to reduce his child support \nobligations after the final divorce order was signed, without success. (AE F) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($18,986) and 1.c ($18,316) are two accounts that have been charged \noff by the same creditor bank. (GE 3, GE 4) SOR \u00b6 1.a is also listed as charged off on a \nrecent credit report, but SOR \u00b6 1.c is no longer listed. (GE 6) He was making payments \nbefore his divorce but after that he could not afford to make any debt payments until \nAugust 2023. (AE P; Tr. 54-56, 76-82, 108-109) \nIn August 2023, after the SOR was issued, Applicant enrolled both these debts in \na debt repayment program. He has an offer to settle SOR \u00b6 1.a ($18,986) for $5,697. He \nis to pay $624 per month towards the debt program for them to use to negotiate with his \ncreditors. The program has an estimated $11,315 in total fees, towards which he pays \n$150 per month, of the $624 he contributes. As of the date of the hearing, he had made \nfour $475 monthly payments ($1,899 total) with $3,798 remaining. (AE G; Tr. 51-56, 76-\n82, 108-109) He also enrolled in another plan where he pays $14.95 a month to a \u201clegal \nclub\u201d for legal advice, financial protection, and financial education. (AE O) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($20,504) is an account placed for collection by creditor C. (GE 3) \nApplicant was unsure what this debt concerned and did not recognize it. He believes it \nmay be to the same creditor as for SOR debts 1.a and 1.c but he was uncertain. He has \nnot reached out to the listed creditor and has not made any payment arrangements. (Tr. \n56-57, 82-85, 101-102) It is listed on GE 3 and is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($8,982) is an auto financing account that has been charged off. (GE \n3) In 2016 or 2017, Applicant bought a replacement vehicle for his college-aged daughter \nwhen her prior vehicle broke down on the interstate. Her mother was unable to help.

The replacement car was a lemon and needed major repairs. His daughter \ndropped the vehicle off at his house in about 2020 or 2021. He had it towed to an auto \nrepair shop. Applicant and his daughter later had a falling out and they are no longer on \nspeaking terms. However, he remains responsible for the debt, since he co-signed for the \nauto loan, now charged off. Applicant has not contacted the creditor to arrange payments. \nHe regards this as his daughter\u2019s debt, though he acknowledged being a co-signer on the \nloan. The debt remains unpaid. Applicant owes an additional $9,000 in repairs for the car. \nHe said he is on an installment plan with the repair shop, and the car remains there. (Tr. \n36-47, 86-87) \nApplicant provided copies of numerous state and federal income tax returns, \nincluding federal returns from tax years 2016-2019 (AE M), state and federal returns from \n2020 (AE H and I), federal returns from 2021 and 2022 (AE K and L) and documentation \nthat a $375 federal refund he received was transferred to address another, undefined \nfederal debt (AE J); and that a State 1 tax debt execution was released in 2024. (AE N) \nApplicant said that he has filed his tax returns appropriately. He hired tax \nprofessionals to file his returns and he said the first firm he hired did a poor job. He said \nhe has now filed all his past-due returns but acknowledged that he still owes about \n$14,000 in past-due federal taxes to the IRS for tax years (TY) 2016, 2018, 2020, and \n2022, as of January 2024. He said he is paying $200 a month on that debt since May \n2024. (Tr. 57-66, 100) Applicant\u2019s federal income tax debt was not alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant has an annual salary of $74,000. (Tr. 50) He took an online financial \ncounseling course after receiving the SOR. He said he intends to address his debts and \npay them off. He said he was not prepared for the divorce or to be responsible for most \nof the marital debts. (Tr. 100-105) He is also caring for his elderly mother, his brother who \nis disabled after a serious medical incident, as well as his son. Both family members are \non Social Security, but Applicant also contributes $2,000 to their care monthly. (Tr. 66-\n68, 73-75; AE V) Applicant provided a personal financial statement (PFS) in which he \nlisted $10,189 in monthly income, $6,692 in monthly life expenses, and $2,800 in monthly \ndebt payments, including a mortgage, two credit cards, and a credit union debt. It is not \nclear that he is making payments on the SOR debts, the debt repair service or his past \ndue taxes. The PFS lists a monthly remainder of just under $400. He asserts that \nunexpected expenses have kept him from addressing his debts. (AE V) \nApplicant has a service-connected disability and receives a monthly disability \nbenefit of about $3,738 from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as of December \n2023. He also receives $1,647 in military retirement pay. (Tr. 69-70 75; AE Q) \nApplicant received numerous decorations and medals during his years in the Army. \nThis includes the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, two Meritorious Service Medals, \nthree Army Commendation Medals, the Joint Service Achievement Medal, six Army \nAchievement Medals, seven Army Good Conduct Medals, several unit awards, and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnumerous appropriate service medals, ribbons, badges, and certificates. (AE S, AE T, Tr. \n107) He testified that he had no punishments or reprimands in the Army. (Tr. 32) \nApplicant said he has had high-level clearances in the past and understands the \nimportance of rules and regulations. He acknowledges his financial issues and says he \nknows that resolving them takes time and resources. He said that he is working on \naddressing his debts. He asserted that he is honest and forthright. (Tr. 32, 47, 114-115) \nApplicant provided four reference letters. Two are from retired military officers and \ntwo are personal friends. They all attested to his strong character, including his honesty, \nintegrity, discretion, commitment, judgment, trustworthiness, reliability, and suitability for \naccess to classified information. (AE U) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of several variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The \nprotection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \n\u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn \nonly those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained \nin the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation \nor conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant incurred delinquent debts when he became financially over-extended \nafter his divorce in 2019. He also had purchased several properties as real estate \ninvestments for purposes of financing his retirement, but was not able to keep up with \nrelated expenses. The SOR debts are established by the credit reports in the record and \nby Applicant\u2019s testimony. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \nApplicant fell behind on his debts due to poor real estate investments, his divorce, \nand helping out family members. To some extent, these were circumstances beyond his \ncontrol. AG \u00b6 20(b) therefore has some application. However, for full application, he must \nestablish that he is acting responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant is addressing the debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c through a debt repayment \nprogram. But he only joined that program after the SOR was issued. He also pays about \n$250 a month in fees, money which might be better suited were it allocated directly \ntowards payments to his creditors. He did not recognize the account at SOR \u00b6 1.b and \nhas taken no steps towards sorting out whether he is responsible for it. SOR \u00b6 1.d, the \nauto financing account for the replacement car for his daughter, is also unresolved. \nFurther, he owes an ongoing debt for repairs on that car. He also acknowledged about \n$14,000 in past-due federal income taxes. Those debts are not alleged in the SOR, but \ntheir existence undercuts a showing that his debts are being resolved or are in the past, \nand do not suggest current financial stability. Applicant has not established that he has \nundertaken good-faith efforts to address his debts, or that he is dealing with them \nresponsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) do not fully apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s debts are ongoing and not isolated. They \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. AG \u00b6 20(c) \ndoes not fully apply. Applicant is participating in some form of recent on-line credit \ncounseling, but his debts are not being resolved and are not under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) potentially applies only to the debt at SOR \u00b6 1.b, which Applicant says \nhe does not recognize. But he has taken no steps to determine his responsibility for the \ndebt and has not met his burden of showing that he is not responsible for it. \nApplicant did not establish that any of the mitigating conditions fully apply to \nmitigate the security concern demonstrated by his delinquencies. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I credit Applicant\u2019s military service, his pursuit \nof an education, and his efforts to provide for his family members in times of need. But \nthe debts remain largely unresolved, and Applicant has not yet undertaken a good-faith \neffort to address them through a track record of steady payments, despite other evidence \nof financial stability. If he does that in the future, he may demonstrate eligibility for access \nto classified information at a later date. But as of now, he has not met his burden of \nshowing that he has mitigated the financial security concerns shown by his history of \ndelinquent debts. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude he did not \nprovide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nConsidering all the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 11, 2024, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 3. Applicant did not submit a response to the \nFORM or object to the Government\u2019s documents. The case was assigned to me on \nAugust 5, 2024. The Government\u2019s documents are admitted into evidence.  \nAdministrative and Procedural Matters \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (Hearing Exhibits (HE) I and II). \nWithout objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in the request. \nThe facts are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated verbatim in this \ndecision. Of particular note, the U.S. Department of State issued a level 4 travel advisory \nto not travel to Lebanon due to the unpredictable security situation related to military \naction between Israel and Hizballah, a U.S. designated foreign terrorist group operating \nin Lebanon. There is the potential for death or injury due to terrorist attacks. Islamic State \nof Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), also a U.S. designated foreign terrorist group, operates in \nLebanon. There is an increase in violent crimes and political violence. Iran continues to \nprovide financial support to Hizballah. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence \nassessed that Iran and Lebanese Hizballah remain committed to terrorist attacks and \nhave the capability to target U.S. persons and interests in the region. There are also \nsignificant human rights issues in Lebanon. (HE I) \nThe UAE has a level 2 travel advisory issued by the State Department, advising \nU.S. citizens to travel with caution. The possibility of attacks against U.S. citizens remains \nongoing and serious. There is a threat of terrorism in the UAE. Illegal exports of dual-use \nmilitary and electronic components and internet technology have passed through the UAE \nand UAE-owned businesses on their way to restricted destinations, such as Iran and Iraq. \nThe UAE has significant human rights issues, including unlawful government interference \nwith privacy and fundamental freedoms. (HE II) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 2.a, and 2.b. He denied SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 2.c. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 25 years old. He is not married and has no children. He is a college \ngraduate. He has worked for his current employer, a federal contractor since November \n2021. (Item 2) \nApplicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (e-QIP) in \nMarch 2022. In it he disclosed that he used marijuana from July 2018 to January 2022, \nwhile in college to deal with stress and anxiety.

(Item 2) \nApplicant reported that because he was a daily user during college, he purchased \nmarijuana monthly. Marijuana was not legal in the state where he lived when he was using \nit. (Item 2) \nApplicant also disclosed in his e-QIP that from May 2019 to August 2020, he used \npsychedelic mushrooms on four occasions. He reported he did not intend to use this drug \nin the future because he did not see the benefit. (Item 2) \nApplicant completed government interrogatories that are undated. In them, he \nadopted and affirmed the accuracy of his March 2022 personal subject interview. In his \ninterview, he told the government investigator that he would travel to a different state \nwhere marijuana is legal and would purchase it there because it was illegal in the state \nwhere he lived. He said that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. In response \nto the interrogatories, he reported that his marijuana use began in June 2018 and \ncontinued until October 15, 2023. He used it weekly and in response to his \u201cintentions of \nfuture use,\u201d he stated that he would use it \u201cas a substitute for alcohol.\u201d He also reported \nhis use of psychedelic mushrooms on two to three occasions from April 2019 to April \n2020, and he had no intentions to use them in the future. (Item 3) \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he denied \u00b6 1.c, which alleged he intended to continue \nto use marijuana in the future. He stated, \u201cI deny, I\u2019ve stopped the use of marijuana.\u201d He \ndid not specify when he stopped using marijuana. (Item 1) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of Lebanon. He \nstated in his SOR answer that she is also a citizen of the United States. She was born in \nLebanon and resides there. He was born in Lebanon and became a citizen by birth of that \ncountry and the United States due to his mother\u2019s citizenship. He has a Lebanese \npassport that he has renewed and uses for convenience to travel there. He has contact \nwith his mother at least twice a week by video. He indicated she has no affiliation with the \nLebanese government or military. He did not provide any other information about his \nmother or how she supports herself or if she has financial interests in Lebanon. He told \nthe government investigator that he does not have any financial interests in Lebanon or \nany obligation to the country. He traveled to Lebanon three times between 2021 and 2022 \nusing his Lebanese passport. (Items 2, 3) \nApplicant has two brothers. SOR \u00b6 2.c alleges his brother is a citizen of Lebanon \nand a resident of the UAE. In his SOR answer, Applicant said, \u201cI deny, he is also a citizen \nof the United States and lives in [State A].\u201d In Applicant\u2019s SCA, he reported he has a \nbrother who was born in Lebanon and is a dual citizen of the United States who lives in \n[State B]. At the time Applicant was interviewed, this brother was a college student. He \nreported a second brother who was born in Lebanon, is a dual citizen of the United States, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand resides in the UAE.

It is unknown if his brother in State B moved to \nState A or if his brother who lived in the UAE has moved to the United States, but it \nappears they both live in the United States. Applicant has contact with both brothers twice \na week. (Items 2, 3) \nApplicant\u2019s father is a citizen of Lebanon and resides in the UAE. He maintains \ncontact with him twice a week. He indicated his father has no affiliation with the \ngovernment or the military. The nature of his father\u2019s job is unknown, as he only provided \nthe name of the company. It is unknown whether his father has a financial interest in \nLebanon or the UAE. Applicant traveled to the UAE on his U.S. passport 16 times from \n2016 to 2021 to visit his family. No other specific information was provided by Applicant \nabout his father. (Items 2, 3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of sensitive information is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a public trust decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe trustworthiness concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nThere are serious terrorism concerns, ongoing human rights problems, and other \nsecurity concerns about both Lebanon and the UAE.

The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nBased on detailed information provided in HE I and II there is sufficient intelligence \ninformation that raises security concerns about both countries. \nApplicant\u2019s two brothers are dual citizens of Lebanon and the United States. It \nappears they both live in the United States. Neither of the above disqualifying conditions \napply to them. I find in Applicant\u2019s favor on SOR \u00b6 2.c. Applicant\u2019s mother is a resident of \nLebanon. There are trustworthiness concerns in Lebanon that create a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, manipulation, inducement, pressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6 17(a) \napplies. \nApplicant\u2019s father is a citizen of Lebanon and a resident of the UAE. As noted \nabove, there are security concerns regarding terrorist activities, human rights issues, and \nother concerns related to the region for both countries that create a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, manipulation, inducement, pressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), and \n7(b) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence trustworthiness concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 8. The following is potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign person, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment  or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships  and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interests; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \nApplicant\u2019s contact with his father and his mother is not casual or infrequent. He \nhas contact with both twice a week and has made numerous trips to the UAE for family \nvisits. He has also traveled to Lebanon three times between 2021 and 2022. There is \ninsufficient evidence about his father\u2019s employment, length of ties and obligations to the \nUAE, and other information that would be helpful in analyzing whether the foreign \ninfluence concern might be mitigated. There is insufficient evidence about how his mother \nsupports herself, her employment, length of ties and obligations to Lebanon, and other \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation that would be helpful in analyzing whether the foreign influence concern might \nbe mitigated. Although there is not a question as to Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States, \nit is unreasonable and unrealistic to ask Applicant to choose between his loyalty toward \nhis parents and the United States if there was a conflict of interest. I am unable to find \nthat it is unlikely that Applicant would be placed in a position of having to choose between \nhis parents and the interests of the United States. Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to question him about \nhis parents and the issues raised by his contact or evaluate his credibility and sincerity \nbased on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nWithout amplifying information, none of the mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about June 2018 to at least \nOctober 2023. He used hallucinogenic mushrooms with varying frequency from April \n2019 to April 2020. He said in his SCA that he did not intend to continue to use marijuana. \nDuring his background interview with a government investigator in March 2022, he again \nsaid he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. However, when he responded to \ngovernment interrogatories, he disclosed he had continued to use marijuana after he \ncompleted his e-QIP, and after his background interview up until at least October 2023, \nand that he intended to use it as a substitute for alcohol. Applicant has repeatedly \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nchanged his mind about his future intent to use marijuana. In his SOR answer, he now \nsays he does not intend to use it in the future. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns \narising from drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nThere is insufficient evidence to apply the above mitigating conditions. Applicant \nhas repeatedly waffled on whether he will discontinue using marijuana. He used it after \nhe was on notice that it was a trustworthiness concern when he completed his e-QIP and \nbackground interview. When he completed his government interrogatories, he said he \nwould use it as a substitute for alcohol. Based on his continued use throughout the \nsecurity review process, I find his drug use is recent and may recur and his conduct casts \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The evidence is \ninsufficient to conclude he is committed to discontinuing his use of marijuana and has \nestablished a significant period of abstinence. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and H in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust \nposition. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness \nconcerns raised under Guideline H, drug involvement and misuse and Guideline B, \nforeign influence. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

Allegedly, his delinquent accounts have not been \nresolved and remain outstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the alleged debts with \nexplanations and clarifications. He claimed all of the SOR-listed debts are the direct \nresult of the legal expenses he incurred associated with his divorce after years of \nmarriage. He claimed that the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c debts will fall off his credit report for \nreaching the \u201c7-year limit.\u201d He also claimed the SOR \u00b6 1.b debt represents a deficiency \nbalance on a repossessed vehicle. Applicant further claimed that he will be able to take \ncare of all of his listed SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e debts by January 2024. He claimed to have \npaid the SOR \u00b6 1.f debt. And, he claimed he will be able to pay off all of his remaining \nSOR-listed debts by April 2024, if he retains his security clearance. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

(GEs 1-4) The SOR-covered debts are listed as follows: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a (a credit card debt for $12,605); 1.b (a deficiency balance on a repossessed vehicle \nin December 2019 for $12,802); 1.c (a credit card debt for $6,176); 1.d (a credit card \naccount for $704); 1.e (a consumer debt for $662); and 1.f (an apartment rental debt for \n$424). Applicant attributed these delinquent accounts to his heavy legal expenses \nassociated with his contested divorce in December 2018 and his ensuing income \nshortfalls. (Tr. 21-22) His divorce decree does not require any spousal sharing of these \naccrued pre-marital debts. \nTo date, Applicant has not addressed any of the debts listed in the SOR with \ndocumented payments and payment plans. (GEs 2-5; Tr. 22-29) While he expects \nseveral of the debts to fall off his credit report by 2025, he has taken no action on any of \nthe listed accounts. (Tr. 27-28) \nStill, he insists that he is willing to address his debts only if he is afforded \nassurances that he can keep his security clearance. (Tr. 30-31) Even with the $15,000 \nbonus he expects from his work this year and the considerable monthly remainder he \nretains, he remains unwilling to pay off the debts without assurance of keeping his \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 24, 32-33) \nApplicant has recently engaged a credit repair firm to monitor his debts. (Tr. 39-\n40) Reported results of the firm\u2019s progress are not available. Based on available \nevidence, his SOR-listed debts remain unresolved and outstanding.  (GEs 2-4; Tr. 26-\n29)  Creditors that Applicant has contacted to date (e.g., SOR creditor \u00b6 1.b) will accept \nonly lump sums in settlement that Applicant is not willing to make without assurance of \nkeeping his security clearance. (Tr. 28-30)  \nApplicant reported no financial counseling. He reported net monthly income of \n$11,200 (inclusive of his $2,200 monthly VA disability payment) and monthly expenses \nof $6,000. (GE 2; Tr. 27, 42-43, 46) After allowing for monthly expenses, he has an \nestimated monthly remainder of approximately $5,200. (Tr. 43) \nWith his currently available resources (even without appreciable savings) and \ndecreased child support obligations, he is well-positioned to address his SOR debts and \nassured his willingness to do so. (Tr. 41-42, 47) So far, though, he has not set up any \npayment plans with any of his creditors, and he has no current timetable for doing so. \nwithout assurances of keeping his security clearance.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. \nThese AGs include conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be considered before deciding \nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n  \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \n           The Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  .  .  .  AG \u00b6 18.   \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

These debt delinquencies warrant \nthe application of three of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration \nguidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19(b), \u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts \nregardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant cited heavy legal expenses associated with his 2018 divorce and \nensuing income shortfalls as factors contributing to his past debt delinquencies. He has \navoided any breaks in employment since his divorce, however, and is financially \npositioned to address his debts. What has prevented him from paying off and setting up \npayment plans with his creditors has been his insistence on receiving assurances of \nkeeping his security clearance as a quid pro quo to addressing his delinquent debts. \nPartially applicable mitigating conditions (MC) of AC F is limited to \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency \na death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or \nidentity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Because \nApplicant has not documented any actions taken to resolve his SOR-listed debts \nthrough payments and payment plans, he cannot satisfy the \u201cacted responsibly under \nthe circumstances\u201d prong of \u00b6 20(b). \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nOct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). Without more \nevidence from Applicant of his addressing his delinquent accounts with payments and \npayment plans, favorable resolution of Applicant\u2019s financial situation cannot be reached. \nWell-intentioned promises linked to security clearance assurance preconditions \ncannot be substituted for a voluntary, good-faith track record of payments.

Applicant\u2019s problems in managing his finances have been \nimpacted to some degree by his 2018 divorce and his incurred legal expenses \nassociated with his divorce. However, he has continued to be fully employed and \npositioned to make measurable progress in addressing his delinquent accounts. Taking \ninto account his credited defense contributions and his extenuating circumstances \nassociated with his 2018 divorce, he has shown insufficient progress in addressing his \ndebts and regaining control of his finances. \nWithout a better track record of good-faith, responsible payment initiatives, \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to date fall short of the level of financial responsibility required to \ndemonstrate his regaining control of his finances. Favorable resolution of Applicant\u2019s \nhandling of his debts cannot be made without a better track record of payment \ninitiatives. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, all the SOR allegations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 42-year-old prospective employee of a defense contractor. He was offered a position overseas as a video teleconference engineer, contingent upon maintaining his security clearance. He is currently holding an unspecified position with another employer since December 2022.

In addition to the FORM, Applicant was \nfurnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his \ncase. Applicant received the FORM on September 13, 2023. His response was due on \nOctober 13, 2023. On September 13, 2023, Applicant submitted a statement and an \nemployment document to which there were no objections. The record closed on October \n13, 2023. The case was assigned to me on January 4, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, all the SOR \nallegations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are \nincorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, \nand upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 42-year-old prospective employee of a defense contractor. He was \noffered a position overseas as a video teleconference engineer, contingent upon \nmaintaining his security clearance. He is currently holding an unspecified position with \nanother employer since December 2022. He previously served as a unified \ncommunications engineer (December 2020 \u2013 December 2022); a VTC technician \n(October 2019 \u2013 December 2020); a unified communications technician (March 2019 \u2013 \nOctober 2019); a network watch officer (March 2017 \u2013 March 2019); a VTC engineer \n(November 2015 \u2013 October 2016); a cable plant engineer (February 2013 \u2013 November \n2015); an audio-visual engineer (December 2009 \u2013 November 2012); and outside plant \nlead (November 2007 \u2013 December 2009). A substantial amount of his employment took \nplace while located overseas in such locations as Qatar, Iraq, Afghanistan, Honduras, \nand Germany. He was unemployed on several occasions: October 2016 \u2013 March 2017; \nNovember 2012 \u2013 February 2013; June 2007 \u2013 November 2007; and April 2005 \u2013 June \n2005. He is a 1999 high school graduate. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in August 1999 \nand served on active duty until April 2005 when he was honorably discharged as a \ncorporal (E-4). He was granted a secret clearance in 1999, and it was renewed as recently \nas August 2009. He has never been married. \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinancial Considerations  \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 2 (Answer to the SOR, undated); Item 4 \n(Responses to Interrogatories, dated April 6, 2023); Item 5 (Verato Credit Report, dated \nApril 7, 2023); Item 6 (Verato Credit Report, dated February 7, 2023); Item 7 (Combined \nExperian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated February 6, 2021); and Item 8 \n(Enhanced Subject Interview, dated March 29, 2021). \nIn his December 2020 SF 86, Applicant denied that he had any delinquent \naccounts. During his March 2021 interview with an investigator with the U.S. Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM), Applicant again denied that he had any such accounts. \nAfter he was confronted with several delinquent accounts that appeared to be in his name, \nhe still claimed to be unaware of them. Nevertheless, he indicated that he would \ninvestigate those accounts and satisfy them if they were his or dispute them if they were \nnot his accounts. (Item 8 at 4-5) \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant reported that several of the accounts were \napparently in his name \u2013 with the identical first and last name of his father \u2013 and that they \nhad been sent to his father, apparently while Applicant was employed overseas. He \neventually acknowledged that all the debt was his, and most of the debt was accumulated \nassisting his terminally ill father financially from abroad. His father passed away in March \n2023. He contends that there is no longer any financial responsibility, and that he chose \nhis father over his debt. (Item 4 at 6) He did not explain why he concluded that there was \nno longer any financial responsibility, especially regarding the two debts totaling $34,552 \nthat were clearly his. \nWhile Applicant admitted that the accounts were in his/their name, he was \ndisputing them. He did not submit any documentation to support his disputes and did not \nspecify the actual bases for his disputes. In his response to the FORM, Applicant noted \nthat the total debt alleged in the SOR was $105,669, but the actual total for which he is \nresponsible is only $60,968. He stated that he had engaged the professional services of \na credit repair/debt consolidation company and is attempting to settle all the debt to a \nzero balance. He added that his prospective position will pay him $220,000 and if he is \ngranted his clearance, it will enable him to pay off the entire debt within one year. \n(Response to FORM at 1) He submitted the employment offer substantiating his \nanticipated annual salary. \nThe SOR alleged five still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $105,669, \nas set forth below: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to a bank credit-card account in his name/his father\u2019s name with \nan unpaid balance of $28,966 that was placed for collection and charged off. (Item 4 at \n2; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 4; Item 8 at 4) At the time this account was opened, \nand the card was sent to his father, Applicant was located either in Afghanistan or \nGermany.

He reported that no repayment arrangements have been made and that no \npayments have been made. (Item 4 at 3) The account is not yet in the process of being \nresolved. \nApplicant reported approximately $8,476 in current net monthly income; and \n$3,055 in monthly household expenses, leaving approximately $5,421 as a monthly \nremainder available for savings or spending. In addition, he noted that he had inherited a \nresidence that had not yet been appraised. (Personal Financial Statement, dated April 6, \n2023, attached to Item 4) If Applicant is granted his security clearance and is finally hired \nto his prospective position, his income will increase substantially. Nevertheless, other \nthan Applicant\u2019s unclear association with a credit repair/debt consolidation company and \nhis attempts to settle his debts, there is no clear evidence of financial counseling or an \nanticipated budget. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation, or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged five still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $105,669. \nMost of those debts are in his name, which also happens to be his late father\u2019s name. On \nits face, without any background information, Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts \nappears to present either an inability to satisfy debts or a history of not meeting financial \nobligations. Despite his initial denials or disputes regarding several of the debts, his \ndeclared willingness to satisfy those debts if they are his debts, rather than his father\u2019s \ndebts, is unambiguous. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established. However, it is \nnoted that the issues associated with the delinquent accounts were first brought to \nApplicant\u2019s attention in March 2021 when he was interviewed by OPM. Despite the \npassage of nearly three years, Applicant seemingly has taken no steps to resolve or to \npay any of the debts alleged. And he did not sufficiently articulate his reasons for not \ndoing so. Accordingly, despite the picture of a substantial increase in salary associated \nwith his prospective position and his declared intentions, in light of his inaction, AG \u00b6 19(b) \nhas also been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(e) might apply if Applicant had been more explicit in describing \nthe entire financial situation, but his statements are confusing at best. Applicant worked \nprimarily overseas when the accounts were opened in his name/his father\u2019s name. He \nmerely hinted that maybe the accounts were opened by, or used by, his father. He \neventually acknowledged that all the debt was his, and most of the debt was accumulated \nassisting his terminally ill father financially from abroad. He now contends that there is no \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlonger any financial responsibility, and that he chose his father over his debt. He did not \nexplain why he concluded that there was no longer any financial responsibility, especially \nregarding the two debts totaling $34,552 that were clearly his. As noted above, although \nhe admitted that the accounts were in his/their name, he was disputing them without \nsubmitting any documentation to support his disputes, and he did not specify the actual \nbases for his disputes. He stated that he had engaged the professional services of a credit \nrepair/debt consolidation company and is attempting to settle all the debt to a zero \nbalance, but he failed to identify the company or submit documentation reflecting their \nanticipated goal and responsibilities. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). After Applicant was interviewed by the OPM investigator, \nhe made no verifiable efforts to address any of the delinquent debts. \nBased on the evidence, it is apparent that Applicant may have intentionally ignored \nhis delinquent accounts for a substantial multi-year period. It is unclear if he opened the \naccounts for himself or his father, or if the accounts were merely sent to his father without \nApplicant\u2019s knowledge. He has made no efforts in working with his creditors either to \ndetermine the facts or to resolve the accounts. The Appeal Board has previously \ncommented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In \nthis instance, other than referring to \u201cdisputes,\u201d Applicant has denied that he had begun \nmaking such efforts even after the SOR was issued. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant clearly stated that he \nintended to pay off his delinquent debts if they turned out to be his responsibility. He did \nnot establish any verifiable repayment plans or verifiable evidence of payments to any of \nthe creditors. And now, without explanation, he declares that he is no longer responsible \nfor the debts. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is no verifiable evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or a repayment \nplan. Applicant reported his current net monthly income and his monthly household \nexpenses. If he had made any good-faith efforts to determine the facts regarding the \naccounts, or to make any payments associated with the two accounts that he \nacknowledged were his, it would reflect positive actions by him. However, Applicant\u2019s \ninaction under the circumstances continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. \n6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some mitigating evidence regarding Applicant\u2019s financial considerations \nunder the whole-person concept. Applicant is a 42-year-old prospective employee of a \ndefense contractor. He was offered a position overseas as a video teleconference \nengineer, contingent upon maintaining his security clearance. He is currently holding an \nunspecified position with another employer since December 2022. He previously served \nas a unified communications engineer; a VTC technician; a unified communications \ntechnician; a network watch officer; a VTC engineer; a cable plant engineer; an audio-\nvisual engineer; and outside plant lead. A substantial amount of his employment took \nplace while located overseas in such locations as Qatar, Iraq, Afghanistan, Honduras, \nand Germany. He is a 1999 high school graduate. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in August \n1999 and served on active duty until April 2005 when he was honorably discharged as a \ncorporal (E-4). He was granted a secret clearance in 1999 and it was renewed as recently \nas August 2009. Applicant reported that several of the accounts were apparently in his \nname \u2013 with the identical first and last name of his father \u2013 and that they had been sent \nto his father, apparently while Applicant was employed overseas. His prospective position \nwill pay him $220,000 and if he is granted his clearance, it will enable him to pay off the \nentire debt within one year. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. There are five still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately \n$105,669. Applicant eventually acknowledged that all the debt was his, and most of the \ndebt was accumulated assisting his terminally ill father financially from abroad. He now \ncontends that there is no longer any financial responsibility, and that he chose his father \nover his debt. He did not explain why he concluded that there was no longer any financial \nresponsibility, especially regarding the two debts totaling $34,552 that were clearly his. \nThe issues associated with the delinquent accounts was first brought to Applicant\u2019s \nattention in March 2021 when he was interviewed by OPM. Despite the passage of nearly \nthree years, Applicant seemingly has taken no steps to resolve or to pay any of the debts \nalleged. And he did not sufficiently articulate his reasons for not doing so. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of taking few if any efforts to resolve the debts, is negative \nand discouraging. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial difficulties. \nSee SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Items 2, 3 and 4) 2 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant had used and purchased marijuana from about November 2021 to about May 2022, after being granted access to classified information by the DOD in 2019. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) Applicant admitted the allegation, and stated at the time he was living in a state where marijuana use was legal under state law. He was not aware that the state law conflicted with federal law, and, in the context of DOD security clearances, that marijuana use was considered illegal. He purchased marijuana from state licensed vendors, and he only used marijuana \u201ca handful of times in 7 months.\u201d He was working full time and attending graduate school, and he had difficulty falling asleep, so he used marijuana as a sleep aid.

He was forthright about his illegal drug involvement during his \nbackground interview, when he became aware that, despite marijuana use being legal \nunder state law in his state of residence, it was still considered illegal under federal law \nand inconsistent with holding a security clearance. His omission of marijuana use on his \nsecurity clearance application (SCA) was unintentional. Applicant refuted the personal \nconduct security concern, and he successfully mitigated the drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse security concerns. National security eligibility is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 18, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines H (drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse), and E (personal conduct). The CAF took action under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn July 25, 2023, Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer). He admitted, with \nexplanation, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a. He requested to proceed with a determination on the \nwritten record by a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. \n(Items 2 and 5) \nOn August 18, 2023, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM) and provided a complete copy to Applicant. Department Counsel\u2019s FORM \nincludes Items 1 through 5. DOHA provided notice to Applicant that he had 30 days from \nthe receipt of the FORM to provide objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or \nexplanation, as appropriate. The notice added that Applicant\u2019s lack of response may be \nconsidered as a waiver of any objections, and that the Administrative Judge would make \na determination based solely on information included in the Government\u2019s FORM. \nOn August 30, 2023, Applicant received the FORM and its attachments. He \nsubmitted a response to the FORM within 30 days of receipt through his counsel and \nprovided a statement of intent to abstain from marijuana use, and two letters of \nrecommendation, which I labeled as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A, B, and C. No objections \nwere raised, and I admitted into evidence all proffered exhibits. \nEvidentiary Issue \nWhile reviewing the evidence in the case file, I noticed that all but one of the \ndocuments in evidence, to include the written arguments provided by Department \nCounsel and Applicant\u2019s counsel, stated that Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana occurred \nin May 2022. Applicant\u2019s statement of intent to abstain from marijuana use, however, \nlisted the date of his last use of marijuana as \u201cDecember 2022.\u201d (AE A) I sent an email \nfor clarification to both attorneys in the case. I asked whether the date of December 2022 \nwas a typo in AE A, or was this the actual date Applicant last used marijuana? Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel replied that December 2022 was a typo in AE A, and that she would submit a \ncorrected copy of AE A to show Applicant\u2019s last date of using marijuana was in fact May \n2022. Applicant submitted the corrected exhibit, which I marked as AE D, and the email \ncommunications were marked as Administrative Exhibit I. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 28 years old. He has never been married, and he does not have any \nchildren. In 2018, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering. In August \n2022, he completed a certificate of engineering leadership, and he is currently pursuing \na master\u2019s degree in electrical and computer engineering. From April 2019 to October \n2022, he worked for a government contractor as a systems engineer. Since November \n2022, he has worked for his current employer, also a government contractor, as a signal-\nprocessing engineer.

(SOR \u00b6 1.a) Applicant admitted the allegation, \nand stated at the time he was living in a state where marijuana use was legal under state \nlaw. He was not aware that the state law conflicted with federal law, and, in the context \nof DOD security clearances, that marijuana use was considered illegal. He purchased \nmarijuana from state licensed vendors, and he only used marijuana \u201ca handful of times in \n7 months.\u201d He was working full time and attending graduate school, and he had difficulty \nfalling asleep, so he used marijuana as a sleep aid. After the school year ended in May \n2022, he stopped his use of marijuana. Applicant has not used marijuana since May 2022, \nand he provided a statement of intent to abstain from marijuana use in the future. (Items \n1-3; AE A) \nPersonal Conduct \nDue to Applicant\u2019s ignorance of state and federal laws, he did not disclose his use \nof marijuana on the security clearance application (SCA) he completed in December \n2022. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) He denied that his omission was intentional falsification. During his \nJanuary 2023 background interview, he was completely candid about his marijuana use \nwhen questioned by an investigator. He stated that he did not realize that using marijuana \nwas wrong. He used marijuana once about every one to two months as a sleep aid, and \nhe purchased marijuana from a dispensary spending no more than $10. He decided to \nstop using marijuana in May 2022 because he did not believe it was helping him with his \nsleep issues and because he also did not like the way it made him feel. He has never \nreported to work under the influence of marijuana, he is not dependent on marijuana, and \nhe has never been arrested or needed counseling for illegal drug use. (Items 2, 3 and 5) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant submitted two character reference letters from colleagues who have \nworked with him in a government contractor employment setting. Both colleagues found \nApplicant to be a person of unquestionable integrity, hardworking, and fully transparent. \nThey recommended Applicant be granted national security eligibility. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 25 \nand the following are potentially applicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana on occasion between November 2021 \nto May 2022. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply to SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nAlthough Applicant held a security clearance that was granted in 2019, there is no \nrecord evidence that he had access to classified information during the times he used any \nillegal drugs. Eligibility for access to classified information and the granting of access to \nclassified information are not synonymous concepts. They are separate determinations. \nThe issuance of a security clearance is a determination that an individual is eligible for \naccess to classified national security information up to a certain level. Security clearance \neligibility alone does not grant an individual access to classified materials. In order to gain \naccess to specific classified materials, an individual must have not only eligibility (i.e., a \nsecurity clearance), but also must have signed a nondisclosure agreement and have a \n\u201cneed to know.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022). \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(3) providing a signed a statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana for a short period of time in a state that \nhad legalized the use of marijuana. He did not know that his use of marijuana violated \nfederal law. He used marijuana as a sleep aid to help him with insomnia. In May 2022, he \ndiscontinued his marijuana use altogether. He decided then that he would never use \nmarijuana again because he did not like it. He also signed a statement of intent that he \nwould never use marijuana in the future. \nApplicant was candid with his history of marijuana use during his January 2023 \nbackground interview. I find he is sincere in his commitment to remain drug-free, and he \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nis unlikely to resume his use of marijuana or any other illegal substance. He has abstained \nfrom using marijuana for nearly two years. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b)(3) \napply. Drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nApplicant admitted that when he completed his December 2022 SCA, he failed to \nprovide complete or accurate information regarding his use and purchase of marijuana. \nApplicant\u2019s confusion about state and federal law cannot be construed as a willful and \ndeliberate attempt to undermine the investigative process. One month after he completed \nthe SCA, he participated in a background interview. It was at this time he learned the \nsignificance of federal law and the implications of holding a DOD security clearance. \nApplicant provided full and complete details about his use and purchase of marijuana \nfrom November 2021 to May 2022. I find that he did not deliberately and intentionally fail \nto disclose his illegal drug involvement with the intent to deceive. \nThe Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification \ncases, stating: \n(a) when  a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has  \nthe  burden  of proving  falsification; (b) proof of an  omission, standing  \nalone, does not establish or  prove  an  applicant\u2019s intent or state  of  mind  \nwhen  the  omission  occurred; and  (c)  a  Judge  must consider the  record  \nevidence  as  a  whole to  determine  whether there is direct or circumstantial  \nevidence  concerning  the  applicant\u2019s intent or  state  of mind  at the  time   \nthe  omission  occurred.  [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge \nto conclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under \nGuideline E and the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to \npresent evidence to explain the omission.  ISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)).  \nApplicant refuted the allegation of falsification of his SCA. No disqualifying \ncondition under Guideline E was established in this record, so discussion of potentially \nmitigating conditions is not warranted. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E to \ninclude the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nThe federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in persons granted access to classified information. In deciding whether to \ngrant or continue access to classified information, the federal government can take into \naccount facts and circumstances of an applicant's personal life that shed light on the \nperson's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, security clearance \ndecisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct during work or duty \nhours. Even if an applicant has a good work record, his off-duty conduct or circumstances \ncan have security significance and may be considered in evaluating the applicant's \nnational security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana occurred under circumstances that are unlikely \nto recur. He has matured and is remorseful about his past involvement with marijuana. \nHe was forthright about his drug-related involvement and provided full details about his \nmarijuana use during his background interview with an authorized DOD investigator. He \nhas made positive changes in his life. Given the entirety of the record evidence, I conclude \nthat Applicant refuted the personal conduct security concerns, and he successfully \nmitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 59 years old. He is married a second time and has one child. He is a high school drop out with three years of junior college. He holds the position of Facility Maintenance Technician employed with a defense contractor. A security clearance is required in connection with this employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The SOR alleged under this guideline that Applicant is indebted to seven creditors, which include collections and charge off accounts, totaling approximately $11,000. In his answer, Applicant admits each of the delinquencies. Credit reports of the Applicant dated November 5, 2022; and September 26, 2023, confirm this indebtedness. (Government Exhibits 3 and 4.) Applicant began working for a defense contractor in October 2022. He applied for a security clearance for the first time that same month. Applicant is currently on disability and is not working. He underwent a 2 double knee replacement surgery in December 2023, and is still recovering. When he is working, he works full time and earns $30 an hour. Applicant stated that he has gone through a lot of bad and unfortunate situations in his life that have brought on lots of stress.

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases after June \n8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 13, 2022; and January 8, 2024, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nDecember 18, 2023. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nnotice of hearing on February 14, 2024, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on \nMarch 7, 2024. \nThe Government offered ten exhibits, referred to as Government \n1 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExhibits 1 through 10, which were admitted without objection.

DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March \n18, 2024. \nAmendments to the Statement of Reasons \n \nOn November 30, 2023, Department Counsel, pursuant to Section E.3.1.13 of \nthe Directive 5220.6 amended the Statement of Reasons as follows: \n \nDepartment Counsel amended Guideline E of the SOR, allegations 2.a., and 2.c., \nby striking them as originally written, and replacing them with the additional language as \nnoted in the amendments. \nDepartment Counsel amended Guideline E of the SOR by adding three \nadditional allegations under 2.g., 2.h., and 2.i., the language as noted in the \namendments. \nDepartment Counsel amended the SOR by adding Guideline J, and allegation 3.a., \nwhich references conduct also included under Guideline E. \nDepartment Counsel also amended the SOR by adding Guideline H, and allegation \n4.a., which references conduct also included under Guideline E. \nApplicant had no objections to any of the amendments. He responded to the \namendments on January 8, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 59 years old.  He is married a second time and has one child.  He is \na high school drop out with three years of junior college.  He holds the position of \nFacility Maintenance Technician employed with a defense contractor.  A security \nclearance is required in connection with this employment.    \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe SOR alleged under this guideline that Applicant is indebted to seven \ncreditors, which include collections and charge off accounts, totaling approximately \n$11,000. In his answer, Applicant admits each of the delinquencies. Credit reports of \nthe Applicant dated November 5, 2022; and September 26, 2023, confirm this \nindebtedness. (Government Exhibits 3 and 4.) Applicant began working for a defense \ncontractor in October 2022. He applied for a security clearance for the first time that \nsame month.

When he \nis working, he works full time and earns $30 an hour. \nApplicant stated that he has gone through a lot of bad and unfortunate situations \nin his life that have brought on lots of stress. Many things happened that were beyond \nhis control, including deaths in his family, COVID, loss of jobs, a divorce, and child \nsupport requirements. At one point, he was homeless. He has a history of cocaine use \nand alcohol abuse. Applicant stated that, he has done a lot of things in his past that \nkept him from doing the right things. He started college but had to quit, he tried to start \nhis own business, he became a jack of all trades to survive, and then COVID hit. His \nhistory of financial problems, poor personal conduct, criminal conduct, and drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse are the basis for this decision. \nApplicant claims that he has transformed himself from his past transgressions \nand he is now an improved individual. He stated that he no longer consumes alcohol or \nuses illegal drugs. He is recently remarried, is involved in his church, and is working \nhard to further improve himself. His wife, whom Applicant\u2019s met on-line have known \neach other for four years. They married in 2023. His wife testified that when she met \nhim, he consumed alcohol, but now he no longer drinks. He has been completely sober \nfor almost four years. She also testified that since they have been together, he has \nnever used any illegal drugs. She finds him to be honest, responsible, trustworthy, and \na man of integrity. When she became unemployed due to COVID, he took responsibility \nfor all of the household finances. He also volunteers doing maintenance and computer \nwork for a Bible University. She stated that her husband is well respected in their \ncommunity and in their church community. (Tr. pp. 29-35.) \n \n1.a. and 1.b.  Applicant failed to timely file his Federal and State income tax \nreturns for tax years 2019, 2020, and 2021.  He eventually filed these returns in April \n2023.  (Government Exhibit 2.)  He stated that he did not file them on time because he \ndid not have the money to pay the taxes he owed.  During these years, he was either in \njail, or had lost his job and was without a source of income.  (Tr. p. 46.)   \nThe following delinquent debts became delinquent and are of security concern: \n1.c.  A delinquent debt is owed to the IRS for delinquent back taxes in the \napproximate amount of $2,882.55.  Applicant stated that he believes he owes more \nlike $3,200.  He set up a payment arrangement to pay $30 monthly through \nautomatic payroll deductions, but when he went on disability these deductions all \nstopped.  (Tr. p. 49.)  The debt remains owing.        \n1.d.  A delinquent debt is owed to a creditor for a medical account (#924232902) and \nwas placed for collection in the approximate amount of $6,270.  Between 2018 and \n2022, Applicant incurred the debt when he got sick and went to the emergency room \nfor medical services.  Applicant stated that he intends to pay the debt when he \nreturns to work.  (Tr. pp. 55-56.)  The debt remains owing. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n        \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.e.  A delinquent debt is owed to a creditor for a medical account (#924232901) and  \nwas placed for collection in the approximate amount of $1,655.  Between 2018 and \n2022, Applicant incurred the debt when he got sick and went to the emergency room \nfor medical services.  Applicant stated that he intends to pay the debt when he \nreturns to work.  (Tr. pp. 55-56.)  The debt remains owing.  \n1.f.  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor for a medical account was placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $522.  Between 2018 and 2022, Applicant \nincurred the debt when he got sick and went to the emergency room for medical \nservices.  Applicant stated that he intends to pay the debt when he returns to work.  \n(Tr. pp. 55-56.)  The debt remains owing.   \n1.g.  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor was charged off in the approximate amount \nof $433.  This was a delinquent credit card.  Applicant contacted the creditor and \ninformed them that he is on disability and not working.  The creditor has not \nresponded.  (Tr. p. 57.)  The debt remains owing.    \n1.h.  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $276.  This was for cable services for Applicant\u2019s apartment.  \nApplicant has not contacted the creditor.  (Tr. p. 58.)  The debt remains owing.     \n1.i.  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor for an account was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $300.  Applicant settled the debt for $45.09 on November \n17, 2023.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.)  \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct \n2.a. and 3.a.  Applicant has a history of criminal conduct involving a number of arrests, \ncharges, and convictions.  On May 30, 2009, Applicant was arrested and charged with \nDriving Under the Influence (DUI).  He was found guilty on this charge on August 28, \n2009.  He was sentenced to 36 months probation, 2 days in jail, required to participate \nin a six-month first offender drug and alcohol counseling program, and required to pay a \nfine.  On or about September 18, 2009, Applicant\u2019s probation was revoked for failing to \ncomply with the terms of probation as he failed to provide proof of enrollment in the six-\nmonth drug and alcohol program by the required date of October 16, 2009.  On or about \nDecember 23, 2009, a warrant was issued for Applicant\u2019s arrest.  Applicant was \nrequired to pay an assessment or serve jail time and serve a total of 14 days in jail.  \n(Government Exhibits 5 and 6.)    \n2.g. \nOn December 1, 2009, Applicant was arrested and charged with public \nconsumption of alcohol.  He was required to serve one day in jail before the case was \ndismissed.  Applicant denied this allegation.  However, court records regarding the \nincident show otherwise.

Applicant was \nsentenced to 3 years probation, 30 days in jail, and required to pay court fees and a \nfine.  Applicant failed to timely pay the court fees and fine.  (Government Exhibits 5 and \n8.)    \n2.b.   On October 19, 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI.  He was \nfound guilty of the charge on February 27, 2015.  (Government Exhibits 5 and 9.)   \n2.c \nOn June 27, 2019, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI.  He was found \nguilty on September 30, 2019.  Applicant was sentenced to 60 months of probation, 4 \ndays in jail, 5 days of community labor, and required to complete an 18-- month alcohol \nprogram, a hospital and Morgue program, and a Mothers Against Drunk Drivers \nprogram.  In about February 2023, Applicant\u2019s case was called for a bench warrant \nhearing.  Applicant remains on probation for this conviction.  (Government Exhibits 5 \nand 10.)   \n2.e. \nIn June 2018, Applicant was suspended for a week from his employment at \nCompany A for reportedly sleeping on the job. Upon his return from the suspension, he \nwas terminated from his employment based on the report that he had been sleeping on \nthe job.  (Government Exhibit 2.) \n2.f. \nApplicant completed a security clearance application dated October 8, 2022.  In \nresponse to Section 13A, Employment Activities, Applicant was asked to provide the \nreason for leaving the employment activity.  In regards to his employment with \nCompany A, Applicant answered, \u201cTerminated/Laid off due to contract ending\u201d. \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose that he was in fact terminated for sleeping on \nthe job.  He also failed to disclose that he had received discipline or a Warning for the \nabove misconduct.  (Government Exhibit 1.)    \n2.i. \nSection 23 of the same security questionnaire asked the Applicant, \u201cIn the last \nseven years, have you used any drugs or controlled substances?  Use of a drug or \ncontrolled substance includes injecting, snorting, inhaling, swallowing, experimenting \nwith or otherwise consuming any drug or controlled substance.\u201d  Applicant answered, \n\u201cNO.\u201d   This was a false response.  Applicant deliberately failed to disclose that he had \nused cocaine from the age of 16 or 17, until at least August 2017.  (Government Exhibit \n1.) \nApplicant denied that he deliberately lied in response to these questions on his \nsecurity clearance application. However, he gives no reasonable explanation as to why \nthey were not answered accurately. (See Applicant Response to Amended SOR.) \nGuideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n2.d. and 4a.  Applicant used cocaine with varying frequency from the young age of 16 \nor 17 until August 2017.  He would snort it with friends or random people.  Applicant \nstated that his use of cocaine would not contribute to any problems.  He could go \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmonths or years without using cocaine. Applicant stated that he was never addicted to \nit, and stopped using it as he no longer associates with anyone who uses drugs. He \nhas no intention of ever using cocaine again. (Government Exhibit 2.) \nApplicant denied his cocaine use in his Response to the Amended SOR. There \nis no reasonable basis for this denial. He provided this information to the investigator \nduring his security clearance background investigation. (Government Exhibit 2.) \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The \nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-\nperson concept. \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant has incurred delinquent debt that he has been unable to afford to pay \nor resolve. At this time there is insufficient information in the record to conclude that he \nis financially stable, or that he can afford his lifestyle, or that he has the financial \nresources available to handle his financial obligations. There is no evidence in the \nrecord to show that any regular monthly payments of any sort are being made toward \nhis debts. In fact, all but one of his delinquent debts remain outstanding. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThere is evidence to show that circumstances beyond the Applicant\u2019s control, \nnamely the impact of COVID, loss of employment, and a divorce have contributed to \nApplicant\u2019s financial indebtedness.  However, since, 2022, when he was hired on by his \ncurrent employer, he has worked full time until December 2023, (when he went on \ndisability) and has done little to nothing to resolve his delinquent debt.  All of his \ndelinquent debts, except one, remain outstanding.  It is understandable that since going \non disability, he has not had sufficient income to resolve his debts.  However, his \ndelinquent debt accounts were opened several years before he went on disability, and \nhe did nothing much to resolve them.  There has been no good faith effort made to \nresolve his debts.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.

Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions below: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nApplicant was not honest when he answered the questions on his security \nclearance as to why he was terminated from his previous employment. He also failed to \ndisclose that he has used cocaine at varying frequencies from 1989 to 2021. This \nconduct shows poor judgment, untrustworthiness and unreliability. Applicant knew or \nshould have known to answer the questions on his application carefully and accurately. \nDeliberately concealing material information from the government on a security \nclearance \napplication \nraises \nserious \nquestions \nabout \none\u2019s \ncredibility \nand \ntrustworthiness. Carelessness shows immaturity and irresponsibility. In either case, \nnone of the mitigating conditions are applicable here, and Applicant does not meet the \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neligibility requirement to access classified information. This guideline is found against \nthe Applicant. \nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains five disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions apply, as discussed below: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nAppellant\u2019s criminal history includes multiple arrests for DUI beginning in 2009 \nand spanning over a period of ten years, until 2019. He remains on probation for his \nmost recent arrest and conviction. This conduct raises the above security concerns. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 32 contains several conditions that could mitigate criminal \nconduct security concerns.  None are applicable in this case. \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense;  and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct, includes multiple arrests, charges, and \nconvictions, that start in 2009 and extend over a ten-year period until his most recent \narrest and conviction in 2019. Applicant is presently on probation for his most recent \nconviction. Applicant stated that he has not consumed alcohol for the past three, almost \nfour years. However, he currently remains on probation for DUI. He is commended for \nhis efforts at sobriety so far and is encouraged to continue his rehabilitation. However, \nmore time in sobriety is needed to assure the Government that he will not return to his \nold ways. At this time, there is insufficient evidence in the record to show that he will \nremain abstinent. Appellant has failed to mitigate the Government\u2019s concerns under the \nCriminal Conduct guideline. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains two conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and   \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.  \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \nand  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused.  \nBoth of the mitigating factors are applicable.  Applicant has not used cocaine \nsince 2017.  He no longer associates with drug users, and he has no intention of ever \nusing cocaine or any illegal drug again.  His actions are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not addressed \nhis financial delinquencies, he was not candid with the Government about his financial \nhistory on his security clearance application, and his long history of criminal conduct \nincluding multiple arrests and convictions for DUIs is troubling. \nFurthermore, he \nremains on probation for his most recent arrest and conviction. Based upon the totality \nof this adverse information, insufficient mitigation has been shown. \nAccordingly, \nApplicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations, Personal Conduct, and \nCriminal Conduct security concerns. The Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nsecurity concern has been mitigated. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a. through 2.i. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a.  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 4.a. \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant is 40 years old. He married in 2011 and divorced in 2014. He remarried in 2016. He has two children from this marriage, ages seven and five. He completed a security clearance application in March 2019. In it, he disclosed that he enlisted in the military in 2000 and he was currently on active duty. The FORM does not list a date of discharge. The evidence provided shows that he was administratively processed for separation in August 2017.

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n01/24/2024 \nDecision \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline G, alcohol \nconsumption. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 19, 2023, the Department of Defense issued to Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline G, alcohol consumption. The \naction was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 25, 2023, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on September \n5, 2023. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The \nGovernment\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 6. Applicant did not respond to \nthe FORM, provide documentary evidence, or object to the Government\u2019s evidence. Items \n1 through 6 are admitted in evidence. The case was assigned to me on November 30, \n2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 40 years old. He married in 2011 and divorced in 2014. He remarried \nin 2016. He has two children from this marriage, ages seven and five. He completed a \nsecurity clearance application in March 2019. In it, he disclosed that he enlisted in the \nmilitary in 2000 and he was currently on active duty. The FORM does not list a date of \ndischarge. The evidence provided shows that he was administratively processed for \nseparation in August 2017. Based on information in the FORM, it appears he was still on \nactive duty in 2019. It is likely he was retained in the military and permitted to retire when \nhe became eligible. He is being sponsored for a security clearance by his current \nemployer, a government contractor. \nThe SOR alleged and Applicant admitted the following: \n1.a: Arrested and charged with driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol \nin October 2009. \n1.b: Received treatment at a Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Program \n(SARP) from May 2014 to June 2014 and was diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder, severe. \n1.c: Arrested and charged with DUI in January 2017. \n1.d: Received treatment at SARP from March 2017 to April 2017 and was \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder, severe. \n1.e: Charged with violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) \nArticles 86, 107, and 134 for providing a false official statement and failing \nto report to place of duty due to excessive alcohol consumption in July 2017. \n1.f: Received treatment at behavioral health clinic from April 2019 to May \n2019 and was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, severe. \n1.g: Received treatment at [X] Hospital from September 2019 to December \n2019 and was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, severe. \n2 \n\n1.h: Continued to consume alcohol excessively and to the point of \nintoxication until July 2022, notwithstanding being diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder, severe on several occasions. \nApplicant completed government interrogatories in June 2023 and affirmed \nstatements he made to a government investigator in May 2019. He acknowledged he had \nbeen arrested in 2009 for DUI. He said he had been drinking at a bar with friends and \nwhen he was driving home, he was stopped by the police. He was charged with DUI. He \nwas convicted and received a fine and his license was suspended. He completed a first \noffender program and was on probation for three years. He did not have to report to a \nprobation officer. He completed his probation. (Items 3, 5) \nApplicant told the government investigator that in about 2012 he began consuming \nalcohol almost daily and then started to binge drink three to five days a month. He said \nthat alcohol began impacting his life negatively in about 2014. He would consume it alone \nat home and would drink 10 or more glasses of whiskey. He attributed his alcohol issues \nto post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He told the investigator that he was unaware at \nthe time that alcohol was impacting his life. He disclosed that he participated in alcohol \ncounseling and treatment and was professionally diagnosed as an alcohol abuser and \nalcohol dependent. (Item 3) \nApplicant said that in May 2014, he voluntarily sought alcohol treatment because \nhe was drinking almost daily for about a year and a half to deal with his PTSD. He went \nto the substance abuse office, and he was screened and diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder, severe and was referred to a rehabilitation program The qualification of the \nperson who diagnosed him is unknown. He participated in the rehabilitation program for \n35 days and then was transferred on orders to a new duty station. (Item 3) \nApplicant disclosed that he was arrested for DUI in January 2017 after he had been \nconsuming alcohol in the barracks and left to get some food. He fell asleep in the drive-\nthru of a restaurant. Military police responded and his breathalyzer results were .24%. \nApplicant was attending a military training course at the time and was told he would fail it \ndue to the incident. He went back to his barracks and continued to consume alcohol. He \nfailed to report to his assigned duty the next day and his command took him to the hospital \nwhere he was placed in the detoxication unit for five days. He was then screened and\ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder-severe and was an inpatient at the Substance Abuse \nRehabilitation Program for 35 days. The qualifications of the person who diagnosed him \nare unknown. He completed the program and returned to his unit. His DUI was dismissed\nin court. (Items 3, 5, 6) \n \n \nApplicant disclosed that in July or August 2017, he went to UCMJ Article 15 \nnonjudicial punishment (NJP) for failing to report to duty, providing a false official \nstatement, and because he was too drunk to go to work (Articles 86, 107 and 134). He \nexplained that he was drinking into the early morning hours and was drunk when he woke \nup. He called his command and told them he was having car troubles. He was staying at \na hotel at the time because he was transferring duty stations. He was supposed to check \n3 \n\nout of the hotel the next day. When he failed to do so, the hotel owner contacted his unit. \nMilitary personnel arrived to do a wellness check. They learned Applicant had lied to the \ncommand. Applicant provided a letter to his command to be considered at his NJP. In it, \nhe said he had to do better, and that he had completely abstained from alcohol \nconsumption and was attending AA at least five days a week. He was working the 12-\nstep AA program and had a sponsor. He was also seeing a counselor and a psychiatrist. \nAt NJP, Applicant received restriction and forfeitures, both of which were suspended. \n(Items 3, 5) \nApplicant told the investigator that in April 2019 he voluntarily sought alcohol \ntreatment because he continued to consume alcohol. He said since 2017 he had been \nbinge drinking three to five days a month. He saw a military mental health professional \nwho diagnosed him with alcohol disorder-severe with PTSD symptoms. He was referred \nto a civilian mental health clinic. He said he saw a doctor there and completed treatment \nin May 2019. He told the investigator that it was unlikely that he would ever consume \nalcohol again because of its negative impact on his life. He said he had gone to counseling \nand rehabilitation, and he and his wife no longer purchase alcohol. (Item 3) \nApplicant completed another set of interrogatories in March 2023. In them, he \ndisclosed that he does not currently consume alcohol and his last consumption was the \nweek of July 25-29, 2022. He said he had five drinks. He said he no longer enjoys \nconsuming alcohol in any setting and does not enjoy the taste or its effects. He disclosed \nhe was taking medication to help him abstain from alcohol consumption. He did not \nprovide any specific information about the type of medication, who prescribed it, and how \nlong he has been taking it. He did not intend to consume alcohol in the future. He \ndisclosed his last blackout was in August 2021. He disclosed his 2014 and 2017 inpatient \ntreatments for alcohol use disorder and was advised as part of his aftercare to attend \nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) and check in with the substance abuse counselor once a \nweek for a year. He further disclosed that from September 2019 to December 2019, he \nreceived treatment and was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder-severe. He was advised \nto attend AA and check-in with his substance abuse counselor once a week for a year. \nHe said he complied with the requirements. He did not provide any documents to support \nhis statements. \nApplicant did not provide a response to the FORM or any corroborating documents \nfrom mental health professionals about his diagnoses of alcohol use disorder. He did not \nprovide information about whether he currently attends AA and if he has a sponsor. He \ndid not provide an update about his sobriety. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concerns for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n5 \n\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety others, regardless of whether the individual was \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder. \nThe evidence supports that Applicant was unable to go to work because he was \ndrunk and lied about it to his command. There is no evidence he was intoxicated at work. \nHe was arrested and charged with DUI in 2009 and 2017. He was convicted of the 2009 \nDUI. There is sufficient evidence that Applicant drank habitually and was binge drinking. \nHe received inpatient treatment and was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder-severe in \n2014, 2017 and twice in 2019. It is alleged and Applicant admitted that each time he \nreceived inpatient treatment he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder-severe. \nHowever, no information was provided as to who made the diagnoses and their \nqualifications, except when he was diagnosed in April 2019 by a military mental health \nprofessional. I find there is sufficient evidence to conclude this person who was \nassociated with the substance abuse treatment facility was qualified to provide this \ndiagnosis. In addition, although it may be a somewhat obvious recommendation that \nApplicant abstain from alcohol consumption, there is no evidence that he was told to do \nso as part of his aftercare. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(c), and 22(d) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n6 \n\n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant has a long history of alcohol abuse. He participated in and completed \ninpatient alcohol treatment four times since 2014, including twice in 2019. In his 2017 \nletter to his command before going to NJP he said he stopped consuming alcohol and \nwas attending AA. He continued to consume alcohol. After being interviewed by a \ngovernment investigator in May 2019 and stating he no longer consumed alcohol and had \nno intention of doing so in the future, he was admitted for inpatient alcohol treatment. The \nevidence does not support that he has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. He \ndid not provide current information that he is participating in counseling, treatment or \nattending AA. The evidence supports that he has a history of receiving treatment and then \nrelapsing. Although, he acknowledges his problems with alcohol, he has not provided \nsufficient evidence of actions taken to overcome the problem. He has been suffering for \nyears with alcohol issues and based on his history, it is likely to recur. Although, Applicant \nstated in his interrogatories that he has not consumed alcohol since 2022, he did not \nprovide updated information about his sobriety. In addition, based on his repeated \nrelapses, even if this statement is accurate, it is too soon to conclude another relapse is \nunlikely to recur. I find none of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n7 \n\n \n_____________________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline G and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under the alcohol consumption \nguideline. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

On \nJuly 3, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Services (DCSA CAS) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person.

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nAG \u00b6 19(a) and AG \u00b6 19(c) apply to Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c \u2013 1.i. The total approximate balance of the delinquent debt is $17,741. Of that \namount, Applicant owes a total of $10,831 in tax liens to the state department of revenue, \nand $6,901 in consumer debt. AG \u00b6 19(f) applies to Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his \nfederal and state income tax returns for tax years 2020 and 2021 as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a \u2013 1.b. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non in the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment:  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies, in part. At some point, Applicant\u2019s car broke down, which is a \ncircumstance beyond his control. However, the mitigating condition is given less weight \nbecause I cannot conclude he acted responsibly under the circumstances because he \nfailed to show any attempt to resolve his delinquent debts. \nNone of the other mitigating conditions apply because Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are ongoing. He failed to initiate a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. He has \nnot provided documentation that he filed his 2020 and 2021 federal and state tax returns. \nOverall, he failed to meet his burden of proof to mitigate the concerns raised under \nFinancial Considerations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant is attempting to \nsave money after his car broke down by taking taxis and ride share. I considered that \nApplicant mentioned in his response to the SOR that he filed the federal and state income \ntax returns for tax years 2020 and 2021. However, he did not provide copies of these tax \nreturns. The amended SOR revealed he owes over $10,000 in state income tax liens for \ntax years 2010, 2016, 2019 and 2022 and over $6,900 in delinquent consumer accounts. \nHe failed to show that he made any attempts to resolve his delinquent accounts. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns raised under financial considerations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Since 2019, he has worked in a security function for a \ngovernment contactor. He was married in 2010 and divorced in 2018. He has two minor \nchildren. He earned an associate degree in 2014 and has earned some credits towards \na bachelor\u2019s degree.

The \nmedical bills in the SOR are connected to that accident. He hired an attorney to sue the \ntruck driver responsible for the accident. His attorney contacted his medical providers and \nadvised them to put their bills into medical liens, so they could be paid from the settlement \nin his case. His case took two years to obtain a settlement, and he recovered $55,000. \nThe attorney that represented him has since closed his office. (Tr. 20-26) \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent medical debts. The status of the allegations is as \nfollows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a delinquent medical account for $27,752. Applicant reported \nthat this debt was for his hospital treatment after the accident. The hospital did not bill the \nVA or his health insurance, but rather put the full amount into collections. Applicant\u2019s \nattorney spoke with the hospital billing department and advised them to put this debt into \na medical lien so they could be paid from the settlement, but they refused to do so. His \nattorney advised Applicant not to make any payments on this debt, since the hospital did \nnot run the bill through any of his insurance providers and refused to follow the protocol \nto be paid from the settlement. Additionally, since the hospital did not make claims through \neither of Applicant\u2019s health insurance providers, the amount of the medical bill actually \nowed by Applicant is unknown. Applicant followed his attorney\u2019s legal and financial advice \non this matter. Applicant used the settlement to cover the rest of his medical bills and \ncosts. Since he was worried that he was going to die soon from cancer, he spent any \nremaining funds on his children. This debt has not appeared on any of the three credit \nreports in the record after August 2023. (Tr. 20-64; GE 2, 3, 4; AE A, B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a delinquent medical account for $3,869.

He provided a DD 214 \nshowing his honorable military service and awards. He provided two professional \ncharacter letters that state he is reliable and trustworthy, he has been relied on to protect \nthe worksite security and personal identifiable information of employees, and he is a \nvalued employee. The letters recommend that he be granted a security clearance. (AE \nC, D, E) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n (c) history of not meeting financial obligations.\nThe financial considerations security concerns are established by the credit \nreports. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \n4 \n\n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond  \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) applies. These medical debts occurred under circumstances unlikely \nto recur, and no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond his control and he acted responsibly under the circumstance, by using his \nattorney to handle his creditors and distribute the settlement funds. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) partially applies. Applicant has a reasonable basis to despite the \nlegitimacy of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. His attorney\u2019s office is now closed, and he was unable \nto provide enough documentation to satisfy the second part of this condition for it to fully \napply. \nApplicant relied on the professional services and advice from his attorney to obtain \na settlement and resolve his medical debts after he was rear-ended by a truck on the \nhighway. There is a standard practice medical providers follow to get reimbursed in \naccident cases. In this case, the hospital failed to follow that protocol or even make a \nclaim with his health insurance providers to get some kind of reimbursement. It was \nappropriate for Applicant to follow professional advice with regard to this debt. He has \ndemonstrated the appropriate reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgement.

And now I probably \nuse it twice a year. (Id.) \nOn February 13, 2023, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator conducting \nhis background investigation. In response to DOHA interrogatories dated July 18, 2023, \nhe reviewed a summary of the interview and indicated that he found it to be accurate after \nadding some additional information. During the background investigation interview, he \nwas questioned about his illegal use of marijuana. He indicated that his last use of \nmarijuana was in February 2023, after he completed his security clearance application in \nDecember 2022. From March 2013 to July 2021, Applicant did not purchase marijuana. \nHe obtained marijuana from his friends. He began using marijuana again in February \n2023. He purchased marijuana from a dispensary. Marijuana is legal in the state where \nhe currently resides. He began using marijuana again because he is around friends who \nsmoke marijuana, and it is legal. He is willing to stop smoking marijuana if it affects his \nsecurity clearance. He told the investigator that he will likely use marijuana in the future. \n(Item 4) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his July 2023, interrogatory responses, Applicant indicated that the last time he \nused marijuana was on June 10, 2023, but he no longer uses marijuana.

He \nbelieves he can contribute to his country and community. (Item 2) \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 2. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in \nregulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno one \nhas a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 \n(1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition \nis not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case can be \nmeasured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to classified \ninformation. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration \nof the whole person and the factors listed in National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective June 8, 2017, or SEAD 4) App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) \nand 2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling \ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. The \u201cclearly \nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt \nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nat 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance decisions are not \na determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication \nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nIn reaching my decision, I specifically considered the following: \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence Memorandum \nAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use, made it clear that state laws do \nnot authorize citizens to violate federal law, including the Controlled Substances Act (21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-971 (1970)), which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. \nChanges to state laws or the District of Columbia, pertaining to marijuana use do \nnot alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. An individual's disregard \nof federal law pertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises questions about the \nindividual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, \nrules, and regulations, including federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed the \nmemorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that federal \nlaw remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production, and \ndistribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position \nare prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana use) remains relevant, but \nnot determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant\u2019s behavior \nraises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern for the illegal use of drugs: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply with regard to Applicant\u2019s illegal use and purchase of \nmarijuana on varying occasions from March 2013 to June 2023. \nThe record established the above disqualifying conditions. An evaluation of \napplicable mitigating conditions is required. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance.

After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nConsidering Applicant\u2019s history of marijuana abuse, none of the mitigating \nconditions apply. Applicant has a long history of marijuana use. An aggravating factor is \nhis continued use of marijuana after submitting his security clearance application in \nDecember 2022 and then after being interviewed in February 2023 in conjunction with his \nsecurity clearance background investigation. His purported last use of marijuana was in \nJune 2023. He professed he would stop using marijuana if it affected his ability to maintain \na security clearance, yet he continued to use marijuana throughout the security clearance \nprocess. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply because his marijuana use was recent and raises \nquestions about his judgment and trustworthiness. \nDuring his background investigation, Applicant indicated it was likely he would use \nmarijuana in the future. His friends use marijuana. There is no indication that he no longer \nassociates with friends who use marijuana. While marijuana is legal in the state where he \nresides, it remains illegal under federal law. He did not submit a signed statement of intent \nto abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse. Even if he provided one, it \nwould carry less weight considering his continued use of marijuana during the security \nclearance process. AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

This action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHold a Sensitive Position, implemented on June 8, 2017.

The \nGovernment submitted its written case on August 22, 2023. The Government provided \nApplicant a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) and the Directive. In \nthe FORM, the Government informed Applicant that it was offering the January 24, 2023 \nsummary of his subject interview with a background investigator into evidence. The \nGovernment advised Applicant of his ability to object to, correct, add, delete, or update \nthe information in the subject interview summary. The Government further advised him \nthat failure to respond could result in a determination by the administrative judge that he \nwaived any objection to the document\u2019s admissibility. He acknowledged receipt of the \nFORM on September 7, 2023. He did not respond. Accordingly, the attachments to the \nFORM are admitted to the record as Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 without \nobjection from either party. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 43, has worked for his employer, a federal contracting company since \nJanuary 2021. He has worked in the aviation industry since March 2013, in positions \nabroad and domestically. He was initially granted access to classified information during \nhis military service from May 2000 to May 2012, when he was medically retired. He \ncompleted his most recent security clearance application (SCA) in December 2022. He \ndisclosed eight delinquent accounts, totaling $28,456. He cited the Covid-19 pandemic \nand having multiple deaths in the family as the reasons for his financial problems. The \nensuing investigation revealed Applicant has payment plans in place for two unalleged \ndebts and has seven unresolved delinquent accounts, totaling $25,973, which are \nalleged in the SOR. He admits all the alleged debts. (GE 1-3) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that his financial problems were \ncaused by two layoffs during the Covid-19 pandemic, the unexpected deaths of two \nfamily members whose funeral expenses he had to pay, and his choice to accept lower \npaying jobs to meet the demands of his family life. However, he only reported one \nCovid-related job change on his SCA. He did not report any deceased close relatives on \nthe SCA, nor did he offer any specific information about the deceased relatives or \nprovide detail about the financial burdens caused by their deaths. The record also does \nnot contain any information regarding his underemployment or the resulting financial \nimpact. (GE 1-2) \nApplicant provided information about his finances in his April 2023 response to \nDOD interrogatories. He reported that he had established payment plans for two \ndelinquent accounts, totaling $65 per month. He also provided a personal financial \nstatement. In addition to his annual salary of $106,000, he receives approximately \n$21,000 annually in disability income from the Department of Veterans Affairs. He \nreported having more than $3,341 in disposable income after paying his recurring \nmonthly expenses.

(GE 4) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nadministrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 \ndescribing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nUnresolved delinquent debt is a serious security concern because failure to \n\u201csatisfy debts [or] meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18). Here, the SOR alleges, and the record supports a \nfinding that Applicant is indebted to seven creditors for $25,973. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nThe Government has established its prima facie case that certain of the financial \nconsiderations apply, specifically: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand,  \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nNone of the mitigating financial considerations concerns apply. Applicant claims \nhis financial problems were caused by events beyond his control; however, his claims \nare not corroborated by the record. Furthermore, the available information shows he \nhas the means to pay his delinquent debts, but it does not contain an explanation for his \nfailure to do so. \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s current security \nworthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-person factors \nat AG \u00b6 2(d). Security clearance adjudications are not debt-collection proceedings. The \nAGs do not require an applicant to immediately resolve or pay each and every debt \nalleged in the SOR, to be debt free, or to resolve first the debts alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. He has not done so. Applicant has not \nestablished the necessary track record of debt repayment necessary to mitigate the \nconcerns alleged in the SOR. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nBased on the record, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance.

(Tr. 6-7, 17-18) In 2016, he graduated from high \nschool. (Tr. 6) He attended a technical school, and in January 2019, he was awarded a \ncertificate of completion. (Tr. 6-7, 17) He has not served in the military. (Tr. 7) He has \nnever married, and he does not have any children. (Tr. 7, 17) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant had several periods of unemployment. His current gross annual pay is \n$51,000. (Tr. 18) When he completed his undated personal financial statement (PFS), his \ngross annual pay was $45,000. His PFS shows his monthly net pay is about $2,900; his \nmonthly expenses are about $2,700; his monthly payment to a credit union is $259; and \nhis net remainder is negative $94. (Tr. 18-19; GE 2) His credit union payment is for a \nvehicle loan for $8,878. (Tr. 20) He did not list any other loan payments on his PFS. (GE \n2) After his raise to $51,000 annually, he has a positive monthly remainder of about $200. \n(Tr. 21)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant has a charged-off debt for $4,300 and SOR \u00b6 1.c \nalleges Applicant has an account placed for collection for $1,507. In 2018, Applicant\u2019s \ntransmission on his vehicle needed to be replaced, and he borrowed the funds from two \ncreditors to pay for replacement of his transmission. (Tr. 23-24) He has not made \npayments arrangements to address either of these debts. (Tr. 22). He may have made \none or two payments in 2018; however, he was unable to afford any other payments to \nthe two creditors. (Tr. 25-26) He planned to make payment arrangements. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant has an account placed for collection for $20,306. \nApplicant said the loans for his technical school were obtained through the Department \nof Education (DoED).

(Tr. 35) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation \nsection, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 which may be \napplicable in this case are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. He had periods of \nunemployment, and he has made some progress addressing his debts. He has initiated \na payment plan to address his student loan collection account, and he made the first $100 \npayment. He paid two non-SOR debts. His annual income is about $51,000, and he has \nsufficient financial resources to address his debts and establish his financial \nresponsibility. \nHowever, \u201c[e]ven if [Applicant\u2019s] financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in \npart, due to circumstances outside his control, the [administrative judge] could still \nconsider whether [he] has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those \nfinancial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing \nISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 \n(App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). A \ncomponent is whether he maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate \npartial payments to keep debts current.

See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant\u2019s three SOR debts are not mitigated. He failed for several years to take \nmeaningful action to address these debts.

Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests.  \nIn this instance, Applicant took some actions after the SOR was issued to bring his \ndelinquent student loan to current status when he started a payment plan in 2023. The \ncreditor provided a payment plan, and he made the first $100 payment. However, the \nAppeal Board clarified that even in instances where an applicant has purportedly \ncorrected his or her financial problem, and the fact that applicant is now motivated to \nprevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of applicant\u2019s \nsecurity worthiness in light of his or her longstanding prior behavior evidencing \nirresponsibility.

Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated at this time. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 26-year-old product repair technician who has worked for a \ngovernment contractor for 14 months. In 2016, he graduated from high school. He \nattended a technical school, and in January 2019, he was awarded a certificate of \ncompletion. He has shown important efforts at self-improvement by achieving the \ncertificate of completion, and his annual income has increased to $51,000, which \ndemonstrates that his employer is satisfied with his performance. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is detailed in the financial \nconsiderations section, supra, and this evidence is more substantial at this time than the \nevidence of mitigation. Applicant did not establish that he was unable to start payment \nplans on at least one of his SOR debts sooner. His failure to take timely, prudent, \nresponsible, good-faith financial actions on the SOR debts raise unmitigated questions \nabout his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \n\u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

When \nshe returned to the local area sometime later in 2020, she continued to use the drug \nuntil March 2021. She never purchased the drug. (Tr. 34-38) \nApplicant knew as an employee of a defense contractor at the time she used \nmarijuana, that it was a violation of federal law. She did not know that she was still \nviolating federal law even with a state medical marijuana card. As she indicated in her \nDecember 2021 PSI, she stopped associating with drug users in March 2021.

(Tr. 22-30) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines, which should be applied \nwith common sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. All available \nand reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be carefully reviewed before rendering a decision. The protection of the national \nsecurity is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d \nThe applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security \ndecision. \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern under the Drug Involvement/Substance Abuse Guideline \nis set forth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled \nsubstance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the \ngeneric term adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors \nlisted above. \nIn my analysis of this case, I have taken administrative notice of Executive \nOrder (E.O.) 12564 signed by the then-President of the United States on September 15, \n1986. The primary positions addressed in the E.O. are: (1) federal employees cannot \nuse illegal drugs; (2) illegal drug use by federal employees, on or off duty, is contrary to \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe efficiency of the service; and (3) persons who use illegal drugs are not suitable for \nfederal employment. \nI have also taken administrative notice of the Director of National Intelligence \nMemorandum (October 25, 2014), Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which clearly states that state laws do not authorize persons to violate federal \nlaws, including the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-971 (1970)), which \nidentifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 controlled drug. \nChanges in state laws or the District of Columbia, pertaining to marijuana use \ndo not change the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, effective June 8, 2017). An individual\u2019s disregard of the \nfederal law pertaining to marijuana involvement remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed the \nmemorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that \nfederal law remains unchanged with respect to illegal use, possession, production, and \ndistribution of marijuana. Disregard of federal law relevant to marijuana use (including \nprior recreational marijuana use) remains relevant, but not determinative to \nadjudications of security clearance eligibility. Agencies are required to employ the \n\u201cwhole-person concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine if an applicant\u2019s behavior \nraises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nAG \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession \nof drug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \nApplicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana from June 2020 to March 2020 meets the \ndefinition of AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and \u00b6 25(c). However, AG \u00b6 25(f) does not apply because the \nrecord does not establish that Applicant was handling classified information in the \nperiod between 2020 and March 2021. There is no evidence that she signed a \nnondisclosure agreement and had a \u201cneed to know.\u201d In addition, she testified that her \nposition did not require a security clearance. See ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. \nBd. Aug. 10, 2022) \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s drug use was infrequent and stopped over three years ago. She has \ndeveloped a strong network of support consisting of her therapist, her church, the \nfriendship of witness #2 and other friends, her family, and exercise, to maintain her \ncommitment to leading a drug free life. This strong support network convinces me that \nshe is unlikely to resume illegal drug use in the future. Applicant\u2019s past behavior no \nlonger raises doubt about her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \n\u00b6 26(a) applies. \nApplicant provided a signed statement of intent to refrain from any drug use, \nacknowledging that future drug use is grounds for revocation of security clearance \neligibility. She has taken complete responsibility for her past illegal drug use. She \nsevered ties with her drug using associates in March 2021. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 26(b)(1), \n26(b)(2), and 26(b)(3) apply to mitigate Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI \nhave \nexamined \nthe \nevidence \nunder \nthe \nguideline \nfor \ndrug \ninvolvement/substance misuse in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-\nperson concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 31 years old. She recently married in October 2023. Witness #1, \nwho has been Applicant\u2019s supervisor since 2018, extols her work product, as well as her \nability to reach effective solutions to complex questions. Witness #2, Applicant\u2019s friend \nsince 2017, is aware of her struggles with substance abuse in the past but has seen her \ntake the necessary recuperative steps to restore a healthy lifestyle. \nThe favorable evidence supporting a security eligibility is sufficient to overcome \nApplicant\u2019s illegal marijuana use between June 2020 and March 2021. I found Applicant \nto be a credible witness who laments her past illegal drug use. Considering all the \nevidence for and against Applicant, together with the favorable character evidence from \ntwo character references, Applicant has successfully met her burden of persuasion \nunder Guidelines H. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 58-year-old naturalized U.S. Citizen. He has an employment offer from a U.S. defense contractor that is conditioned upon his being granted security clearance eligibility. He was born in Somalia. In 1990, he fled Somalia to Pakistan. He lived in Pakistan for about 10 years and attended college there. In 2000, after the U.S. government approved his refugee status, he moved to the United States. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2005. From approximately 2010 until 2019, Applicant lived and worked in Ghana. He first entered Ghana with a visa. To reside in Ghana, he was required to renew his resident permit annually for $1,000. After about 2013, he stopped paying the $1,000 because he thought it too expensive. Therefore, he resided illegally in Ghana for at least five years. In 2019, when he decided to leave Ghana, he paid a $500 bribe to a Ghanian immigration official to \u201ccure\u201d his failure to renew his resident permit, and to obtain the requisite documentation to leave the country. He claimed that he bribed the official because everyone does it and it is the way things work in Africa.

Without objection, I take \nadministrative notice of the facts contained therein. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 58-year-old naturalized U.S. Citizen. He has an employment offer \nfrom a U.S. defense contractor that is conditioned upon his being granted security \nclearance eligibility. He was born in Somalia. In 1990, he fled Somalia to Pakistan. He \nlived in Pakistan for about 10 years and attended college there. In 2000, after the U.S. \ngovernment approved his refugee status, he moved to the United States. He became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in 2005. From approximately 2010 until 2019, Applicant lived \nand worked in Ghana. He first entered Ghana with a visa. To reside in Ghana, he was \nrequired to renew his resident permit annually for $1,000. After about 2013, he stopped \npaying the $1,000 because he thought it too expensive. Therefore, he resided illegally in \nGhana for at least five years. In 2019, when he decided to leave Ghana, he paid a $500 \nbribe to a Ghanian immigration official to \u201ccure\u201d his failure to renew his resident permit, \nand to obtain the requisite documentation to leave the country. He claimed that he \nbribed the official because everyone does it and it is the way things work in Africa. He \nhas worked and resided in the U.S. after he left Ghana in 2019, but he plans to live and \nwork in Somalia if he is employed by the government contractor. (Items 3, 5, 6) \nApplicant has a high school diploma from a school in Somalia. He attended \ncollege while in Pakistan without earning a degree. In 2008, he earned a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree from a college in the United States. In 2002, he married a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen who was born in Somalia. He and his wife have a 21-year-old daughter together \nwho is a U.S. citizen. Their daughter suffers from autism and is non-verbal. In 2021, his \nwife moved to Somalia with their daughter, and they have resided there since (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c). He does not know their whereabouts, however, when he completed his February \n2023 counterintelligence security screening questionnaire, he provided a city or town in \nSomalia in which they reside. As of about January 2023, Applicant had not had contact \nwith his wife or daughter since they moved to Somalia. They are not legally separated, \nbut Applicant considers himself \u201cdivorced.\u201d Applicant has an 11-year-old daughter with a \nwoman with whom he had an extramarital affair. His younger daughter is a U.S. citizen \nresiding in the U.S. He provides financial support to his younger daughter that is not \ncourt mandated. He is no longer intimate with the mother of his 11-year-old daughter. \nHis spouse is not aware of the extramarital affair or his other daughter. (Items 3-6) \nApplicant has three brothers who are citizens and residents of Somalia (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a). He has three sisters who are citizens and residents of Somalia (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He \nhas contact with three of these Somalian siblings at least one or twice per month via \ntelephone or social media. Two of these brothers work for the Somalian department of \neducation. With respect to the three remaining Somalian siblings, he had no contact \nwith them since 2020. He has occasionally sent one of his Somalian siblings some \nmoney when he needed it for living expenses, and he has told one of his siblings that he \nis seeking employment as a translator for the United States government. He claimed he \nwill not tell any of his other Somalian family about this employment unless he is thus \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nemployed. Some of these siblings own real property in Somalia, but Applicant does not \nstand to inherit any Somalian property. There is no evidence that he owns any real \nproperty in the United States, and he rents his residence here. (Items 3-6) \nApplicant has never been a member of the Somalian military or worked for the \nSomalian government. In addition to his 11-year-old daughter, he has friends and \nassociates who reside in the U.S. He claimed his allegiance is solely to the United \nStates, and his Somalian family members could not be used to compromise this \nallegiance. (Items 3-6) \nSomalia \nI take administrative notice of the information contained in AN I about country \nconditions in Somalia, and the United States\u2019 relationship with it, including, but not \nlimited to: \nThe State Department has assessed Somalia as being a high threat location for \ncrime directed at or affecting official U.S. government interests. Violent crime such as \nkidnapping, bombings, indirect fire attacks, murder, assassinations, armed robbery, \ncarjacking, and illegal roadblocks by armed individuals in uniforms occur throughout \nSomalia. Significant human rights issues exist in Somalia, including unlawful or arbitrary \nkillings, arbitrary arrest or detention, enforced disappearances or abductions, and \nserious government corruption. \nThe terrorism situation in Somalia remains unstable and dangerous. No area in \nSomalia is immune from violence; and the potential exists throughout the country for \nhostile acts, either targeted or random, against foreign nationals at any time. (AN I) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nThe nature of a nation's government, including its level of control, its relationship \nwith the United States, and its human-rights record are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant's family members and foreign contacts are vulnerable to \ncoercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly \ngreater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member or \nfriend is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence collection operations against the United States, or the foreign \ncountry is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nApplicant has three brothers and three sisters who are citizens and residents of \nSomalia. His estranged wife and eldest daughter are residents of Somalia. His \nconnection to his family members residing in Somalia presents a potential conflict of \ninterest. The administratively noticed country conditions in Somalia, such as terrorism, \ncivil unrest, and its human-rights record, raise these security concerns to the level of a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his siblings and his older daughter is sufficiently \nclose to raise a security concern about his desire to assist them by providing sensitive \nor classified information. As a matter of common sense and human experience there is \na rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, their \nimmediate family members. Application of Guideline B is not a comment on an \napplicant's patriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people may act in \nunpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a loved one, \nsuch as a family member. (ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009)). AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are established. However, AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are not established with \nrespect to his estranged wife. I find that because his relationship with his estranged wife \nis sufficiently attenuated by a lack of contact, and because of the general concept that \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmarital bonds are perhaps more easily dissolved than sibling relationships, there is no \nconflict of interest or heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion with respect to her. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nCountry conditions in Somalia raise security concerns to the level of a \nheightened risk. Applicant has two brothers and one sister in Somalia with whom he \nmaintains close and frequent contact. He has provided one of them with money to help \nwith living expenses. While there is no evidence that he has been in frequent contact \nwith his other siblings who reside in Somalia since 2020, he did not meet his burden to \nestablish his familial bonds with those siblings have been broken. His older daughter \nresides in Somalia. While he has a daughter here and other ties to the United States, \nsuch as a job and friends, I do not find that those ties are greater than the bonds he has \nwith his many close family members in Somalia. I find that he has failed to provide \nsufficient evidence that any of the Guideline B mitigating conditions apply with respect \nto his Somalian siblings and his daughter who resides in Somalia. \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \nApplicant had an extramarital affair that resulted in his having his younger \ndaughter. His estranged wife did not know about the affair or the younger daughter. \nThese allegations are contained in SOR \u00b6 2.a, which specifically references his \nestranged wife being unaware of these facts. He has not had contact with his estranged \nwife since 2021, and he considers himself \u201cdivorced.\u201d Given these considerations, I do \nnot find that his estranged wife potentially finding out about the affair and the existence \nof his younger daughter can be used as a source of coercion, exploitation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6 13(c) is not established. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nSOR \u00b6 3.a cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s extramarital affair and his younger daughter \nthat resulted from that affair. SOR \u00b6 3.b alleges his 2019 bribery of a Ghanian \nimmigration official to exit Ghana after consistently failing to pay a more costly Ghanian \nresidency renewal fee. These incidents are not sufficient for an adverse determination \nunder any other single guideline, but support a whole-person assessment of \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, lack of candor, etc. AG \u00b6 16(c) is \nestablished. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nIn terms of overall societal impact, adultery is a relatively minor transgression. \nApplicant\u2019s affair has been over for many years. He has not been in contact with his \nestranged wife since 2021. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(e) are applicable and I find for \nApplicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 3.a. \nI do not find that Applicant has shown that bribing a foreign government official is \na minor offense. While it has been about six years since he engaged in the actual \nbribery, he was also intentionally living illegally in Ghana for at least five years prior to \nthe bribery. \nHe did not acknowledge the impropriety of his conduct. Instead, he attempted to \njustify it by minimizing it as something everyone does. As he does not appear to \nunderstand that what he did is wrong, I do not find that he has shown that his \ninappropriate behavior is unlikely to recur. With respect to this conduct, none of the \nGuideline E mitigating factors are sufficiently applicable to mitigate the Guideline E \nsecurity concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines B, D, and E in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns under Guidelines B and E. The security concerns under \nGuideline D were not established. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant, except with\nrespect to his estranged wife, as\nreferenced in 1.c, which I find for\nApplicant. \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline D: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n",

He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g. His \nadmissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 71-year-old, self-employed, owner-operator of a truck leased to a \ndefense contractor since April 2019. He attended college from January 1972 to June 1973 \nbut did not receive a degree. He married in April 1972, divorced in April 1976, and \nremarried in May 1976, and has two adult children. He underwent a background \ninvestigation by another government agency in November 2011 and was cleared to \ntransport explosives, but he has never held a security clearance. \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent consumer debts reflected in credit reports from \nJanuary 2022, August 2022, April 2023, and January 2024 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h).

Applicant \ndenied this debt. The last payment on this debt was in August 2020. It was charged off in \nOctober 2020. (FORM Item 10 at 4) In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that he \nhas never purchased a vehicle from this company. However, he stated that he would \ncontact the creditor to make payment arrangements after he pays his credit-card debts. \nHe submitted no documentary evidence of contact with the creditor and no documentary \nevidence that he has disputed the debt with the original creditor, collection agency, or \ncredit bureau. The debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: delinquent credit-card account placed for collection of $8,748. \nApplicant admitted this debt.

(FORM Item 4 at 11) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. \nBd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s recent incapacitation and his wife\u2019s \nmedical problems were conditions largely beyond his control, but they occurred after the \ndebts became delinquent. He submitted no evidence of the reasons for his failure to timely \nfile his tax returns or pay the taxes due. His incapacitation is relevant to his inability to \ncontinue making payments on his tax debt and to comply with the settlement agreement \nfor the delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Because he did not respond to the FORM, \nI am unable to determine if he has resumed the payments on either debt. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1c \nthrough.1.h, which are not resolved. It is partially established for the debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.b, on which he was making payments until he was injured in July 2023. He submitted \nno evidence of payments after July 2023. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant denied the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, \n1.c, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g, but he submitted no documentary evidence showing that he \ncontested those debts with the original creditor, the collection agencies, or the credit \nbureaus. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is partially established for the failure to timely file federal tax returns \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i and federal tax debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j. Applicant started filing his \npast-due tax returns in March 2019, and he began making payments on his tax debt in \nJuly 2020, before he submitted his SCA in November 2021. He submitted no evidence \nthat he notified the IRS of his incapacity in July 2023. Because he did not respond to the \nFORM, I am unable to determine if he filed his return for 2022 or made any payments on \nhis tax debt after April 2022. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised his delinquent consumer debts, \ntax debt, and failure to timely file his federal tax returns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The SOR further informed Applicant that, based on information \navailable to the government, DoD adjudicators could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 25, 2023, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on December \n18, 2023. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing on January 10, 2024, scheduling the hearing for February 15, 2024. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GX) 1 through \n4, which were admitted without objection, and Hearing Exhibits (HX) 1 through 3 for \nAdministrative Notice.

DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on February 26, 2024. \nProcedural Rulings \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya. Department Counsel provided a 17-page \nsummary of the facts, supported by Government documents pertaining to Somalia, \nEthiopia, and Kenya, identified as HE I~3. The documents provide elaboration and \ncontext for the summary. I take administrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. \nGovernment reports as to Somalia and Ethiopia; but not of Kenya, as explained under \nFindings of Fact, below. The administratively noticed facts are limited to matters of \ngeneral knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. As noted, they are set out in the \nFindings of Fact. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted to all the allegations in SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 33 years old, and currently unemployed, but seeks employment by a \ndefense contractor as a linguist. (TR at page 18 line 1 to page 19 line 17, and GX 1 at \npage 5.) He is married to a Somali citizen, and has three children, who live with their \nmother in Somalia. (TR at page 23 line 8 to page 26 line 2). \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence & Guideline C - Foreign Preference \n1.a. Applicant\u2019s father is a U.S. citizen, but for about ten months of each year \nlives apart from his wife (Applicant\u2019s U.S. based mother) in Somalia. (TR at page 29 \nlines 18~19, and at page 43 lines 4~21. \n1.b. and 1.c. Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of Ethiopia, but resides in Somalia with \ntheir three minor children. He is seeking U.S. citizenship for his wife, and U.S. \ncitizenship for his children has recently been \u201capproved,\u201d as evidenced by \ndocumentation. (AppXs H and M~P.) Applicant speaks with his immediate family on an \nalmost daily basis. (TR at page 23 line 8 to page 26 line 2, and at page 43 line 4 to page \n41 line 20.) \n1.d.~1.g. Applicant\u2019s widowed mother-in-law, three sisters-in-law, and one of his \ntwo brothers-in-law are citizens of Ethiopia, but reside in Somalia. His mother-in-law and \nsisters-in-law are housewives. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law \u201cworks in construction.\u201d He \ncommunicates with them once or twice a year. Applicant never met his other Ethiopian \nbrother-in-law, who resides in Austria.

Applicant\u2019s friend is a citizen of Somalia; but resides in Kenya, where he \nowns a business. He last saw this friend in 2020 in Kenya, \u201cabout three years ago. (TR \nat page 32 line 5 to page 33 line 13.) \n1.i., 1.k. and 1.l. Applicant\u2019s father owns a 25% interest in his family\u2019s Somalia company \nvalued at more than $8,000,000. Applicant worked for his father\u2019s company for about \nten years from 2012 to 2022. Also, from October 2016 to about January 2018, Applicant \nowned and operated one of the company\u2019s supermarkets. As none of Applicant\u2019s U.S. \nbased siblings ever worked for their father\u2019s company, there is a strong likelihood that \nApplicant will inherit his father\u2019s share of the company. (TR at page 21 lines 1~16, at \npage 33 line 24 to page 36 line 19, and at page 37 line 14 to page 41 line 14.) \n1.j. Applicant maintains a $20,000 bank account in Somalia, which he uses to \nsupport his wife and children. (TR at page 26 lines 4~14, and at page 27 lines 5~10.) \nNotice \nI take administrative notice of the following facts about Somalia and Ethiopia. \n(Applicant\u2019s connection to Keya through his friend is de minimis, at best.) \nSomalia is a federal parliamentary republic. The U.S. Department of State has \nissued a Level 4: Do Not Travel Advisory for Somalia. Al-Shabaab continues to pose a \nsignificant terrorist threat in Somalia. The Islamic State branch in Somalia (IS-Somalia) \nis also active. (HE1.) \nEthiopia is a federal democratic republic. The U.S. Department of State has \nissued a Level 3: Reconsider Travel due to sporadic violent conflict in border areas. Al-\nShabaab also continues to pose a significant terrorist threat in Ethiopia. The \nGovernment of Ethiopia continues to partner with the U.S. government on \ncounterterrorism issues. (HE 2.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Four are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest  \nApplicant\u2018s immediate family live in Somalia. He lived and worked in Somalia \nfrom 2012 to 2022, and only recently returned to the U.S. Applicant also has a potential, \nmultimillion dollar financial interest in Somalia. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nNone of these apply. Applicant\u2019s family, significant business interests, and \nfortune are clearly in Somalia. Foreign Influence is found against Applicant. \nGuideline C - Foreign Preference \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the \nUnited States. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the \nfact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not \ndisqualifying without an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at \nconcealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or \nprivilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) applying for and/or acquiring citizenship in any other country; \n(b) failure to report, or fully disclose when required, to an appropriate \nsecurity official, the possession of a passport or identity card issued by \nany country other than the United States; \n(c) failure to use a U.S. passport when entering or exiting the U.S.; \n(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of employment, \nposition, or political office in a foreign government or military \norganization; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) otherwise acting to serve the interests of a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in any way that conflicts with \nU.S. national security interests; \n(e) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in \nanother country in violation of U.S. law; and \n(f) an act of expatriation from the United States such as declaration of \nintent to renounce U.S. citizenship, whether through words or actions. \nNone of these apply. Foreign Preference is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and C in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is a \nrespected in the linguist community. (AppXs I~K.) However, overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. He has extensive and continuing familial and financial interests in \nSomalia, where the significant threat of anti-western terrorism creates high potential for \npressure, coercion, or duress. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the Foreign Influence security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.l: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without comments, both of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a marine engineer with his current employer since July 2020. He previously worked for various employers in a variety of positions, including marine engineer (August 2019 \u2013 July 2020); test and evaluation support analyst (September 2018 \u2013 August 2019); and field engineer (April 2028 \u2013 September 2018). A 2010 high school graduate, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. A merchant marine from June 2014 until April 2018, he was commissioned a lieutenant in the inactive U.S. Naval Reserve in June 2014, and apparently remained in that position until 2022. (Item 4 at 2) He was granted a secret clearance in 2009. Applicant has never been married. He has no children.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 18, 2021, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application (SF 86). On an unspecified date, the Defense Counterintelligence \nand Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Services (CAS) issued him a \nset of interrogatories. On January 27, 2023, Applicant responded to those interrogatories. \nOn October 25, 2023, the DCSA CAS issued him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive \nAgent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016), \neffective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DCSA adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nIn two separate statements, dated September 11, 2003, and April 20, 2024, \nApplicant responded to the SOR and elected to have his case decided on the written \nrecord in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material \n(FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \non July 10, 2024, and he was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the \nFORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on July 17, 2024. His \nresponse was due on August 16, 2024. Applicant chose not to respond to the FORM, for \nas of August 21, 2024, no response had been received. The case was assigned to me on \nSeptember 27, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without comments, both of the \nfactual allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a marine engineer with his current employer since July 2020. He previously worked \nfor various employers in a variety of positions, including marine engineer (August 2019 \u2013 \nJuly 2020); test and evaluation support analyst (September 2018 \u2013 August 2019); and \nfield engineer (April 2028 \u2013 September 2018). A 2010 high school graduate, he received \na bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. A merchant marine from June 2014 until April 2018, he was \ncommissioned a lieutenant in the inactive U.S. Naval Reserve in June 2014, and \napparently remained in that position until 2022. (Item 4 at 2) He was granted a secret \nclearance in 2009. Applicant has never been married. He has no children. \nFinancial Considerations \nIn his SF 86, Applicant reported that he had failed to file his federal and state \nincome tax returns for the tax year 2021, but that year was erroneously reported as the \ncorrect year was 2020. His explanation for his failure was \u201clate filing this year.\u201d (Item 3 at \n35) No further explanations were provided. On August 31, 2021, he was interviewed by \nan investigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). During that \ninterview, he acknowledged that he failed to timely file his income tax returns for 2020 \nbecause he has been \u201clazy.\u201d He said he planned on filing both his federal and state tax \nreturns by September 5, 2021. (Item 8 at 2) He eventually reported in his January 2023 \nresponse to the interrogatories that in 2020 he moved from one city to another and during \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe move he packed his W-2 data and had difficulty locating it. \u201cThe taxes were not filed \ndue to neglect and inability to find the proper documents.\u201d (Item 4 at 2) An Account \nTranscript issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), dated March 21, 2023, and \nattached to Applicant\u2019s response to the interrogatories, reports \u201cno tax return filed.\u201d (Item \n4 at 4, and 6) Applicant furnished a self-prepared (through an online professional tax \npreparation service) unsigned and undated \u201cdraft\u201d of a Form 1040 for 2020 (Item 4 at 8-\n10) but stated that he was \u201cstanding by for final assessment\u201d from the IRS before filing it. \nThe tax preparation service estimated that Applicant had an adjusted gross income of \nabout $65,000; a total tax of about $7,368; and an expected refund of about $1,932. (Item \n4 at 8) \nApplicant also furnished a self-prepared (through the online professional tax \npreparation service) unsigned and undated \u201cdraft\u201d of a state income tax return form. (Item \n4 at 13-16) The online professional tax preparation service noted that Applicant had \nactually signed the return electronically, and that he had no tax balance or refund due. \n(Item 4 at 12) \nApplicant was repeatedly offered the opportunity to submit documentation to \nconfirm that his federal and state income tax returns for the tax year 2020 had been filed: \nto the OPM; with his response to the interrogatories; with his Answer to the SOR; and in \nresponse to the FORM. Notably, Applicant has never stated that the income tax returns \nwere filed. He only gave dates or an \u201cassessment\u201d by which he intended to file them. \nDespite the SOR alleging only Applicant\u2019s failure to timely --\nfile federal and state \nincome tax returns for the tax year 2020, the government repeatedly refers to unalleged \nconduct as well: a satisfied city personal tax lien in the amount of $947; a charged off \ncredit card in the amount of $688; possibly unfiled federal and state income tax returns \nfor the tax years 2021-23; and possibly unpaid federal and state income tax for those \nsame years. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes a condition that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his federal and state income tax \nreturns for the tax year 2020. As of October 25, 2023, the date the SOR was issued, there \nis no verifiable evidence that either of those income tax returns had been filed. Applicant \nwas afforded multiple opportunities to submit documentation confirming that his federal \nand state income tax returns has been filed, but other than his intended filing date \nexpressed to OPM and the pending status he referred to in his response to the \ninterrogatories in January 2023, he has repeatedly failed to submit such confirmation. AG \n\u00b6 19(f) has been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. The nature, frequency, and recency of \nApplicant\u2019s continuing failure to conclusively resolve those delinquent federal and state \nincome tax issues, despite repeated promises to do so, make it rather easy to conclude \nthat they were not infrequent and, considering the length of time it took him to start to \nresolve those issues, if he has actually done so, they are likely to remain unchanged in \nthe future. Applicant attributed his financial issues essentially to laziness and due to \nneglect and inability to find the proper documents. It is unclear what his explanations are \nfor his repeated failures to furnish verification and confirmation that the income tax returns \nhad finally been filed. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \nApplicant completed his SF 86 in June 2021; underwent his interview with an OPM \ninvestigator in August 2021; completed his responses to the interrogatories in January \n2023; the SOR was issued in October 2023; and the FORM was issued in July 2024. \nEach step of the security clearance review process placed him on notice of the \nsignificance of the financial issues confronting him. With respect to his unfiled federal and \nstate income tax returns, there is no verifiable evidence that Applicant has filed those \nincome tax returns. By failing to present such evidence, he has not demonstrated the high \ndegree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified \ninformation. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has observed: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id.

Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an applicant has \npurportedly corrected his or her federal tax problem, and the fact that the applicant is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof an applicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of his or her longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. (See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well \nthat ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR). \nApplicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. (See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010).) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

A 2010 high school graduate, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. \nA merchant marine from June 2014 until April 2018, he was commissioned a lieutenant \nin the inactive U.S. Naval Reserve in June 2014, and apparently remained in that position \nuntil 2022. He was granted a secret clearance in 2009. In his SF 86, he candidly reported \nthat he had failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for one particular \nyear, although he misidentified the year in question. During his OPM interview, he also \nacknowledged that his failure to do so was in part because of laziness. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant failed to timely file federal and state income tax returns for the tax \nyear 2020. As of the date the SOR was issued in October 2023, or his response to the \nFORM was due in August 2024, he has failed to say that the income tax returns had been \nfiled, and he has failed tp produce verifiable evidence to confirm they had been filed, \ndespite repeated opportunities to do so. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

He is 39 years old, \nmarried, and he has two children, ages 14 and 12. He obtained his general education \ndiploma in 2004. As of his December 2021 security clearance application (SCA), he \nattended college since September 2013 but had not yet earned a degree. Since April \n2011, he has worked as a foreman for his employer, a defense contractor. He previously \nworked for the same company from August 2005 to January 2006. He was first granted \na security clearance in 2013. (Items 1-4) \nThe SOR alleges Applicant failed, as required, to timely file his federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax years (TY) 2017-2021 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c); owes federal income \ntaxes of approximately $28,803 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); owes state income taxes of approximately \n$4,127 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); owes $28,304 in delinquent consumer debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.h); and \nowes a $90 delinquent medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.i). The allegations are established by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer, December 2021 SCA, March 2022 background \ninterview, July 2022 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax account transcripts, a January \n2023 credit bureau report (CBR), and his June 2023 response to interrogatories. (Items \n1-5) \nApplicant discussed his failure to timely file his relevant income tax returns and \npay his taxes in his SCA: \nUpon working through the 2017 tax worksheet, my wife and I discovered \nthat we would owe for that year. At the time, we were unable to pay the \namount owed up front and decided to file later in the year when we would \nbe able to be on an installment plan. I was under the assumption that my \nwife had filed the taxes later that year however, during recent conversations \nabout finances in order to prepare for my clearance renewal, I was made \naware that our taxes had in fact not been filed for 2017 or subsequent years \n(2017-2019). \nOnce I was made aware that our income taxes had not been filed for 2017-\n2019, my wife and I sat down and completed the tax worksheets for those \nyears. In addition, installment plans were requested for the amounts owed. \nThese worksheets, along with all additionally required documentation were \nsent to the IRS via certified mail on 12/17/21. 2020 taxes were filed as well \nvia certified mail however they were filed past the tax day deadline. These \ntaxes are not yet satisfied as we are waiting on the IRS to process the \nreturns and respond to the installment plan request. We have also made \nadjustments to our withholdings to prevent owing in the future. Previously, \nwe each claimed two for our two children but have reduced that down to \none each. We have also worked vigorously on our budget moving forward \nso that the installment plan can be easily accommodated.

(Item 4) \nJuly 2022 IRS tax account transcripts reflect that Applicant filed his federal income \ntax returns for TYs 2017 to 2018 in May 2022; he filed a federal tax return for TY 2019 in \nJune 2020; he had a zero balance for TYs 2018 and 2020, but no federal income tax \nreturn for TY 2020 had yet been filed; and he owed federal taxes in the amounts of $5,641 \nfor TY 2017 and $14,034 for TY 2019. Applicant indicated during his background interview \nthat he was awaiting a response from the IRS and the state tax authority concerning a \nmonthly payment plan to resolve his outstanding federal and state taxes. He intends to \nabide by the plans and resolve his outstanding taxes upon receipt of a response from the \nIRS and state tax authority. He failed to provide any further documentation. (Item 4) \nApplicant attributed his consumer debt to financial hardship. He also \nacknowledged during his background interview that he and his spouse lived above their \nfinancial means. After voluntarily surrendering his car in November 2019 to ease his \nfinancial strain, he incurred the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e for the remaining balance due on his \nauto loan. After he and his family relocated to a different city in March 2020, he incurred \na $5,150 debt for vacating their rental property before the conclusion of their lease, which \nhe paid in February 2021. He was disputing the accuracy of the credit card debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.g. He contacted the creditor for SOR \u00b6 1.h in December 2021 and negotiated and \nbegan paying $50 monthly to resolve this debt by September 2023. He was unaware of \nthe medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i, but he intended to contact the creditor to resolve it. He was \nworking to settle and pay his delinquent debts, to include SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.h, and 1.i. He did \nnot provide documentation to corroborate his claims of payment or dispute toward his \nSOR consumer debts. (Items 3-4) \nApplicant indicated during his background interview that his household net monthly \nincome was $10,642. After paying their monthly expenses, he indicated that their \nhousehold net remainder was $1,110. He has $8,000 in a retirement savings account. He \nindicated he is working on resolving his financial obligations and he intends to do so. \nThere is no evidence in the record that he has received financial counseling.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant did not timely file his federal and state income tax returns for TYs 2017 \nthrough 2021. He owes approximately $28,803 in past-due federal income taxes and \napproximately $4,127 in past-due state income taxes. He also owes approximately \n$28,304 in delinquent consumer debt and a $90 delinquent medical debt. The above \ndisqualifying conditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhile conditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his financial problems, \nhe must show that he acted responsibility under his circumstances. He filed his federal \nincome tax return for TY 2019 in June 2020 and for TYs 2017 to 2018 in May 2022, before \nthe SOR was issued. As such, I find SOR \u00b6 1.a, in part, for Applicant as to these tax \nyears. \nHowever, Applicant did not provide documentation to corroborate his claims that \nhe filed his federal income tax returns for TYs 2020 and 2021 or his state income tax \nreturns for TYs 2017 to 2021. He also failed to provide documentation regarding his efforts \nto negotiate a payment plan with the IRS and the state tax authority for his outstanding \nfederal and state taxes, or of his efforts to resolve or dispute any of his consumer debts. \nThere is also no evidence that he has received financial counseling. There is insufficient \nevidence for a determination that his tax problems will be resolved within a reasonable \nperiod, and I am unable to find that he acted responsibly under the circumstances or that \nhe made a good-faith effort to pay his outstanding taxes. His financial issues are recent \nand ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. None of the mitigating conditions are sufficiently applicable to mitigate the \nremaining security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case.

The case was assigned to me on \nNovember 30, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of \nfact. \nApplicant is 33 years old. He served in the military from 2008 until his honorable \ndischarge in 2015 in the rank of E-5. He married in 2014 and divorced in 2016. He has \nno children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2019. He has worked for his present \nemployer, a federal contractor, since June 2022. \nApplicant disclosed in his August 2022 security clearance application (SCA) that \nhe experienced periods of unemployment from May 2017 to September 2017, March \n2018 to May 2019, and December 2019 until October 2020. The later due to the \npandemic. (Item 2) \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts. Most appear to be credit card debts. The \ntotal delinquent amount alleged is approximately $45,208. The debts are corroborated by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer, SCA, interrogatories, statement to a government \ninvestigator, and credit reports from September 2022 and August 2023. (Items 1-6) \nIn his SCA, Applicant disclosed the credit card debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \n($5,460), 1.b ($5,390), 1.c ($1,684), 1.h ($2,633) and presumably 1.g (he disclosed the \namount owed was $11,000, the current balance appears to be $13,839, as alleged). For \nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a he said he spoke with the bank, and he planned to make \nmonthly payments on the debt. He stated in his SCA that he was having money issues at \nthe time and could not make the payments on the debts. He said he was living beyond \nhis means, never learned about proper budgeting when he was growing up, and when he \njoined the military, he went crazy with his spending. He said he made most of his mistakes \nas a young military member. He said in the SCA that he had not taken action on the \naccounts, and they were canceled by the creditors. He planned on looking into credit \ncounseling services that could help him. (Item 2) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in November 2022. He \nacknowledged his delinquent debts and attributed them to his being unknowledgeable \nabout finances, credit, and money in general. He also lived beyond his means and over-\nextended himself with credit cards. He allowed his financial delinquencies to linger and \neventually go to collections. He told the investigator that he had contacted all of the \ncreditors but was not in a position to make payments towards his debts.

(Item 4) \nApplicant responded to government interrogatories in April 2023. He was asked to \nprovide information on each of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h. He \nresponded that none of the debts were paid. He had not made payment arrangements \nwith any of the creditors and was not making any payments on any of the debts. He said \nthe cause of his financial problems was because of his divorce and discharge from the \nmilitary, which left in a bad financial situation. He said he planned on making things right \nand paying off his outstanding accounts. As part of his interrogatories, Applicant provided \na personal financial statement, which reported he is timely paying five debts. None of \nthem are those alleged in the SOR. (Item 3) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all of the debts alleged. He said he\ntook full responsibility for the debts and intended to make things right and pay what he \nowed in \u201cdue time.\u201d He said he had made a payment arrangement for the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($723). He provided a document showing that he authorized an electronic \npayment of $12.95 a month beginning in December 2022 and continuing through \nNovember 2024. He did not provide additional documents to show he is in compliance \nwith the agreement. He also stated he hoped to fix his credit issues. No additional \ninformation or documents were provided. (Item 1) \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has eight delinquent debts totaling more than $45,000. There is sufficient \nevidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant has not resolved any of his delinquent debts. They remain current and \noverdue. AG \u00b6 20 (a) does not apply. He attributed his financial problems to overextending \nhimself, being unsophisticated in handling his finances, a divorce, discharge from the \nmilitary, and unemployment. His divorce was in 2016 and his discharge from the military \nwas in 2015. These factors may have been beyond his control, but it has more than seven \nyears since these events occurred. Applicant\u2019s unemployment was beyond his control. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHis overspending was within his control. Applicant has been aware that his delinquent \ndebts were a security concern. He failed to provide sufficient evidence that he has acted \nresponsibly regarding his debts. Although some of the factors that impacted his finances \nmay have been beyond his control, he provided scant evidence of any actions he has \ntaken to address them. He recently made a payment arrangement for one of his smaller \ndebts but did not provide updated evidence to show he has complied with the \narrangements. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) has limited application. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant is receiving financial counseling or that there \nare clear indications that his financial problems are being resolved and under control. AG \n\u00b6 20(c) does not apply. Without additional documents, I cannot apply AG \u00b6 20(d) to the \nsmall debt Applicant indicated he is paying. There is insufficient evidence that Applicant \nis making good-faith efforts to repay his creditors. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. He has not \nprovided evidence that he has a reasonable dispute about the legitimacy of any of the \ndebts alleged. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph   1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Item 5 at 4, 11.) \nLaw and Policies  \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has noted, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n5 \n\n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe followings conditions are applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR debts are established by Applicant's admissions and the Government's \ncredit reports. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply. The next inquiry is whether any mitigating \nconditions apply. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe \nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmedical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by \npredatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due \ndebt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue. \nThe SOR debts on average became delinquent in 2021. So, they did not arise that \nlong ago. And they persisted to be delinquent in 2022 and 2023. Thus, they are recurring. \nThe SOR allegations are not mitigated by AG \u00b6 20(a). \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has an initial requirement. That is, an applicant\u2019s financial problems \nmust have been the result of conditions \u201clargely beyond\u201d his control. Thus, those \nconditions must have caused the financial problems. Applicant cited only logistical \nproblems as the cause of his delinquencies. More specifically, in moving from the east \ncoast to the west coast, he failed to update his autopay settings, thus disrupting his \npayment of bills. That is not a condition \u201clargely beyond\u201d his control. In fact, he solely \ncaused that problem The SOR allegations are not mitigated by AG \u00b6 20(b). \nFor four debts, Applicant said there were payment arrangements in place. (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.h, and 1.m.) He did not, however, provide any documents supporting those \nassertions. Those SOR allegations are not mitigated by AG \u00b6 20(d). \nApplicant\u2019s responses to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.g, 1.j, 1.l, and 1.o indicate that he disputes \nthe legitimacy of those debts, He did not, however, provide documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or evidence of his actions to resolve the issue. Those \nSOR allegations are not mitigated by AG \u00b6 20(e). \nIn addition to the inapplicability of the mitigating conditions discussed above, \nApplicant\u2019s responses to the SOR allegations also share one overarching infirmity. Except \nfor SOR \u00b6 1.c, which he mitigated with documents showing he paid it, he has not provided \nany documentation supporting his assertions about the current status any of the other 14 \nSOR debts. The Appeal Board has held that \u201cit is reasonable for a Judge to expect \napplicants to present documentation about the satisfaction of specific debts.\u201d See ISCR \nCase No. 09-07091 at 2 (App. Bd.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nAs part of my application of our facts to the whole-person concept, I have \nconsidered facts that are not alleged in the SOR. Unalleged conduct cannot be an \nindependent basis for a denial. It can, however, be used to evaluate credibility and in the \nwhole-person analysis. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). The \nfollowing facts will be considered for those limited purposes. Applicant\u2019s most recent \ncredit report reflects two new delinquent debts: (1) an account that is past due in the \namount of $174, with a total balance of $615; and (2) an account that has been charged \noff in the amount of $235. Both became delinquent in 2023. Although the total amount \ndue is not substantial, given his record, I deem those facts to reflect adversely on his \nfinancial reliability. \nApplicant leaves me with questions about his eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings  \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d \u2013 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion  \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant access to classified information.

His diagnosis \non admission was alcohol use disorder, severe; cannabis use disorder, severe; stimulant \nuse disorder for amphetamine-type substances, moderate; and cocaine use disorder, \nmoderate in early remission. (GX 5 at 10) After completing three phases of treatment in \nprogressively less structured environments, he transitioned to outpatient treatment on \nOctober 16, 2019, where he participated in group counseling and individual counseling. \nOn July 15, 2020, he stopped attending individual counseling and attended only group \ncounseling.

He was still in outpatient \ntreatment when he submitted it. In this SCA, he disclosed that he smoked marijuana about \nonce a month from September 2011 to November 2018. He disclosed that he used \nAdderall without a prescription during college and after college until October 2018. He \ndisclosed that he used cocaine from June to October 2018. He disclosed that he received \ntreatment for alcohol abuse from April to October 2019. In this SCA, he stated that he no \nlonger used alcohol or any types of drugs. (GX 1 at 44-48) He was granted eligibility for \naccess to classified information in July 2020. \nIn September 2020, Applicant was arrested for being drunk in public. He was found \nheavily intoxicated in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant. He had driven to the \nrestaurant in his car, but he was found eating food in a stranger\u2019s car. He was held in \ncustody until he was sober. While being held, he called the two officers vulgar names and \nattempted to head butt them.

Because he did not submit a new \nSCA, DCSA changed Appellant\u2019s clearance status to \u201cNo Determination Made\u201d on July \n1, 2021. (GX 12). \nOn a date not reflected in the record, Applicant was diagnosed with attention deficit \nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Between August 2013 and August 2023, he used Adderall \nto control his ADHD, but he exaggerated his symptoms when he asked his doctor for a \nprescription. He would obtain a 30-day supply and use it within about 10 days. (Tr. 63) In \nMarch or April 2019, he used Vyvanse, another drug for ADHD, one time after a friend \ngave it to him. (Tr. 64) \nBetween July 2020 and September 2023, Applicant used cocaine 15 or 20 times. \n(Tr. 58) On September 4, 2023, he sent an email to his supervisor, asking for time off for \npersonal reasons. He testified that at this time, \u201cthe clearance was the last thing on my \nmind,\u201d and he \u201cjust wanted to be free of drugs and alcohol.\u201d (Tr. 67) On September 5, \n2023, he self-admitted into a drug and alcohol recovery program for 30 days. (GX 4) In \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories, he stated that as of September 4, 2023, he was \nconsuming ten beers weekly and ten mixed drinks weekly. (GX 2 at 4) \nOn October 6, 2023, Applicant entered a long-term treatment program. His \ndiagnosis upon admission was cocaine use disorder, moderate or severe; and alcohol \nuse disorder, moderate or severe.

He successfully \ncompleted the aftercare program on May 14, 2024, and transitioned to \u201cgeneral outpatient \nprogramming.\u201d He completed the treatment program on June 11, 2024. The program \ndirector stated that Applicant was an active participant in group discussions, \ndemonstrated a positive attitude, and consistently exhibited a commitment to recovery. \n(AX D) \nThe owner of the treatment program that Applicant recently completed is a 54\u00ad\nyear-old member of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) who has been sober for 22 years. He \nand Applicant have become friends. He submitted a letter stating that Applicant \u201cstruggled \nmightily\u201d to stop drinking and change his life. He believes that Applicant is \u201cwalking the \nwalk,\u201d of integrity and sobriety. He considers Applicant a \u201csolid guy,\u201d and he is very \noptimistic about Applicant\u2019s future. (AX A; Tr. 18-23) \nAnother friend of Applicant, who has been an active member of AA since 1992, \nsubmitted a letter vouching for Applicant\u2019s commitment to sobriety.

He believes that Applicant \nhas taken his alcohol problem very seriously. (Tr. 24-26) \nThe SOR alleges multiple falsifications in Applicant\u2019s December 2019 SCA. SOR \n\u00b6 3.a alleges that he deliberately failed to disclose the full extent of his misuse of \nprescription drugs. In his SCA, he disclosed using Adderall from August 2013 to \nDecember 2017, but in his response to the SOR, he admitted using Adderall from August \n2013 to April 2019 and from June 2020 to August 2023. \nSOR \u00b6 3.b alleges that Applicant failed to disclose the full extent of his treatment \nfor misuse of drugs or controlled substances. In his SCA, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the \nquestion whether he had ever sought counseling or treatment as a result of his use of a \ndrug or controlled substance. In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he received \ntreatment from April 2019 to August 2020. When asked at the hearing why he answered \n\u201cNo\u201d to the question, he responded, \u201cThat\u2019s a great question.\u201d (Tr. 72) \nSOR \u00b6 3.c alleges that Applicant failed to disclose the full extent of his alcohol \nabuse. In his SCA, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question whether his use of alcohol had a \nnegative effect on his work performance, his professional or personal relationships, his \nfinances, or resulted in intervention by law enforcement or public safety personnel. His \nanswer was inconsistent with his time off from work while in therapy, and it omitted his \narrest in December 2020. \nSOR \u00b6 3.d alleges that Applicant failed to disclose that he was still in outpatient \ntreatment when he submitted his SCA.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan at 531. Substantial \nevidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d See ISCR \nCase No. 17-04166 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2019) It is \u201cless than the weight of the \nevidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence \ndoes not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d \nConsolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro.

ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,\nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nThe evidence submitted at the hearing establishes the following disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \nAG \u00b6 22(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed \nclinical social worker) of alcohol use disorder. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive\nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem,\nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified\nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment\nrecommendations; and \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment program \nalong with any required aftercare and has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance \nwith treatment recommendations. \nAG \u00b6 23(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption was \nrecent, frequent, and did not occur under unusual circumstances. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and 23(d) are not established. Applicant has acknowledged his \nmaladaptive alcohol use and provided evidence of actions to overcome his problems with \nalcohol. He entered a treatment program in April 2019, relapsed in June or July 2020, \nand left the program before completing it in August 2020. He relapsed a month later. He \nentered a mental health treatment program in October 2023, and completed it in June \n2024, after he received the SOR. Insufficient time has passed to establish a pattern of \nmodified consumption or abstinence. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe evidence submitted at the hearing establishes the following disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed \nclinical social worker) of substance use disorder; \nAG \u00b6 25(e): failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program \nprescribed by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(d): satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s drug involvement was recent, frequent, \nand did not occur under unusual circumstances making it unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not established. Applicant has acknowledged his drug abuse. He \nhas made new friends and contacts through his participation in AA, but he provided no \nevidence that he has disassociated with previous drug-involved friends and associates. \nHe has not provided the statement intent provided for in AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(d) is not established. Applicant completed the most recent treatment \nprogram, but he submitted no evidence of a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. . . . \nThe following disqualifying condition is relevant to this case: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated adult. He had undergone the security-\nclearance process at least once before submitting an SCA in January 2022. On the other \nhand, he had been involved in heavy drinking and drug use and was still in a drug-\ntreatment program when he submitted his SCA. He admitted at the hearing that he had \nused so many drugs and drank so much that he \u201ccould not keep tabs on what I was doing.\u201d \n(Tr. 71) \nSOR \u00b6 3.a alleges that Applicant falsified his 2019 SCA by deliberately failing to \ndisclose his misuse of Adderall and Vyvanse, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 1.d. His \nmisuse of Vyvanse was a one-time occurrence in March 2019, and it is likely and plausible \nthat Applicant forgot to list it, not fully understanding the requirement for full disclosure. \nHowever, his misuse of Adderall was a major component in his drug abuse and not one \nthat he would have inadvertently overlooked. This allegation is established for his failure \nto disclose his misuse of Adderall, but it is not established for his failure to disclose his \none-time use of Vyvanse. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.b alleges that Applicant falsified his 2019 SCA by deliberately failing to \ndisclose the full extent of his drug treatment as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. The SCA asked, \n\u201cHave you ever voluntarily sought counseling or treatment as a result of your use of a \ndrug or controlled substance,\u201d and he answered \u201cNo.\u201d When asked why he said \u201cNo,\u201d he \nresponded, \u201cThat\u2019s a great question,\u201d but he offered no explanation. This allegation is \nestablished. \nSOR \u00b6 3.c alleges that Applicant falsified his 2019 SCA by answering \u201cNo\u201d to the \nquestion, \u201cIn the last seven (7) years, has your use of alcohol had a negative impact on \nyour work performance, your professional or personal relationship, your finances, or \nresulted in intervention by law enforcement/public safety personnel?\u201d At the hearing, he \ntestified that it did not affect his work because he told his bosses about his problems, and \nhe was still completing his work assignments. He admitted that he missed work because \nof heavy drinking and that his paychecks were reduced. He did not address his arrest for \nbeing drunk in public. This allegation is established. \nSOR \u00b6 3.d alleges that Applicant falsified his 2019 SCA by stating that he had \ncompleted his treatment, when in fact he was still in outpatient treatment. Applicant \ndenied this allegation, stating that he had completed the plan, was attending outpatient \ntreatment, and was participating in AA. The treatment records reflect that he disengaged \nfrom individual therapy, stopped attending group therapy before completing the program, \nand that attempts to contact him were unsuccessful. This allegation is established. \nApplicant\u2019s multiple falsifications of his 2019 SCA are sufficient to establish the \ndisqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(a). While Applicant\u2019s memory may have been \nsomewhat muddled by his abuse of alcohol and drugs, he was familiar with the questions \nin the SCA and the importance of candor during the security clearance process. He \noffered no plausible excuse for his numerous falsifications. \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant did not attempt to correct his omissions \nuntil he was confronted with the evidence. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s falsifications were recent, frequent, and \ndid not occur under unique circumstances. They were not minor, because they \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nundermined the integrity of the adjudication of his most recent SCA. Falsification of an \nSCA \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G, H, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Once a concern arises \nregarding an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information, there is a strong \npresumption against granting eligibility. ISCR Case No. 09-01652 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, \n2011), citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 \nU.S. 905 (1991). Applicant has not overcome that presumption. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines G, H, and E and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns raised by alcohol consumption, drug involvement, and personal \nconduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Alcohol Consumption): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H (Drugs/ Substance Misuse): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 9, 2021. \nOn July 17, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Services (DCSA CAS) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F.

The case was forwarded to the DOHA Hearing Office on \nJanuary 24, 2024, and assigned to me on March 14, 2024. \nEvidentiary Matters \nItem 1 contains the pleadings in the case and is part of the record. Items 2 through \n5 are admitted into evidence. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 42, is an employee of a DOD contractor since March 2023 who is \nseeking a security clearance. He served on active duty in the United States Air Force \nfrom March 2003 to April 2018. He separated with an honorable discharge. He has a high \nschool diploma and some college credit. He is married and has two children. (Item 2) \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 9, 2021. \n(Item 2) A subsequent background investigation revealed the Applicant had seven \ndelinquent accounts, an approximate total of $82,000. The SOR debts include: a $5,381 \ncollection account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Item 4 at 2; Item 5 at 4); a $60,567 \ndelinquent account owed to the Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS) that was \nplaced for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Item 4 at 5; Item 5 at 9); and a $12,349 delinquent \naccount placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Item 4 at 2; Item 5 at 4; Item 6 at 6). \nAdditional delinquent debts include: a $1,817 delinquent cell phone account placed \nfor collection (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Item 4 at 3); a $1,296 delinquent account placed for collection \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e: Item 4 at 3; Item 5 at 3); a $1,294 delinquent account placed for collection \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f: Item 4 at 3; Item 5 at 3); and a $240 delinquent cable television account that \nwas placed for collection. (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Item 4 at 3) \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admits all the SOR allegations. The largest \ndebt is the $60,567 debt owed to DFAS. (SOR \u00b6 b) When Applicant separated from active \nduty, DFAS overpaid him. He was notified months later that he owed this amount for the \noverpayment. He indicated that attempts to settle or close the account will begin on \nJanuary 1, 2024. He also mentioned that he will begin to settle or resolve the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c starting in January 2024. He did not provide any updates \non his attempt to settle these debts. (Item 1, Response to SOR) \nApplicant mentioned that he will make arrangements to settle or close the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.f as soon as possible. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g is related \nto his failure to return a modem when he cancelled a cable television account. He \nmentioned he will return the modem to the cable company as soon as it is found. (Item 1, \nResponse to SOR) \nApplicant mentioned that he fell behind on his debt during his transition from the \nmilitary to the civilian world. His wife was also unemployed. He did not provide updates \non any of the accounts alleged in the SOR. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \nUpon his separation from active duty, Applicant was unemployed from April 2018 \nto August 2018.

Their monthly expenses \nare $3,000 a month. They have $2,900 left over each month after expenses. (Item 2 at 5) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 19(a) and AG \u00b6 19(c) apply to Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.g. The total approximate balance of the delinquent debt is over $82,000. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non in the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment:  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies, in part. Applicant and his wife both had periods of \nunemployment, which was a circumstance beyond his control. However, the mitigating \ncondition is given less weight because I cannot conclude he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances since he failed to show any attempt to resolve his delinquent debts. \nNone of the other mitigating conditions apply because Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are ongoing. He failed to initiate a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. He has \nnot attended financial counseling. Overall, he failed to meet his burden of proof to mitigate \nthe concerns raised under Financial Considerations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F \nand evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 63 years old. She is currently single after her two previous marriages ended in divorce. She does not have any children. She has four years of college credits, but not enough for a college degree. From 2004 to 2010 she worked for a federal government contractor as a graphic designer. She unexpectedly lost her job in late 2010, and she was unemployed for about 18 months until she became employed in April 2012. She worked about eight months until her contract ended. For the next nine months she freelanced as a graphic designer, but she did not earn sufficient income. She worked various jobs from 2013 to late 2018, but the income from these jobs was nominal. In late 2018, she was hired by an employment servicer to work for a large federal government contractor. In February 2019, the government contractor hired her directly. Applicant\u2019s current annual salary is approximately $72,000. Her employer is sponsoring Applicant for a DOD security clearance.

For the next nine months she \nfreelanced as a graphic designer, but she did not earn sufficient income. She worked \nvarious jobs from 2013 to late 2018, but the income from these jobs was nominal. In late \n2018, she was hired by an employment servicer to work for a large federal government \ncontractor. In February 2019, the government contractor hired her directly. Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent annual salary is approximately $72,000. Her employer is sponsoring Applicant for \na DOD security clearance. (Tr. 18-23; GE 1) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges Applicant failed to file her 2009, 2010, and 2012 Federal income \ntax returns. She also failed to file her state income tax returns for the same years. She \nadmitted both SOR allegations (\u00b6 1.a and \u00b6 1.b) She stated in her SOR response that she \nwas unable to file these income tax returns due to grief, divorce, medical issues, \nunemployment, and underemployment. She stated that she had filed her 2009, 2010, and \n2012 Federal income tax returns, and she had filed her 2012 state income tax return. Her \ntax preparer was currently working on her 2009 and 2010 state tax returns, and she \nexpected to have those filed soon. (SOR response) \nApplicant stated that her financial problems occurred in 2010, after she separated \nfrom her second husband, and she also unexpectedly lost her job. During the summer of \n2010, she discovered from her husband that he had not filed their income tax returns for \n2009. He had always been the one to handle their tax returns. This was during a \ntumultuous period in their marriage. He told Applicant he would file the 2009 tax returns \nwhen he filed their 2010 income tax returns. Not long after that statement, they separated. \nHe had her W-2s and all the other necessary tax documents. She kept asking him if he \nhad filed their tax returns, but she was unable to get a response from him. She did not \nlearn until the spring of 2011 that he had not filed their 2009 or 2010 Federal and state \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ntax returns.

She was responsible by filing her 2011 income tax returns because they \nwere still married but living separate. (Tr. 24-25; SOR response) \nIn 2012, Applicant was dealing with significant back issues. She was getting \nepidurals for pain management. She was working parttime, and the medication her doctor \nprescribed for her pain kept her in a mental fog. She was not earning enough income, \nand she depleted her full retirement account by 2012. Due to these withdrawals, she was \nworried she would owe taxes for 2012, but she did not have any money at the time. She \nwas more focused on paying her living expenses and trying to find employment with a \ndecent wage. She did not file her 2012 Federal or state income tax returns. (Tr. 25-27; \nSOR response) \nApplicant was hired in February 2019 by her current employer. It was at this time \nshe started to address her income tax filing problem. She was now earning enough \nincome to take care of these issues by finding a tax preparer, but she was having difficulty \nfinding W-2s and other documents for specific tax years. She filed her 2018 and 2019 \nFederal and state tax returns timely. In July 2019, she was asked by her employer to \napply for a DOD security clearance. She filed all of her delinquent income tax returns for \ntax years 2013 through 2017. She owed approximately $14,000 in back taxes for these \nyears, which has been completely satisfied. Her tax preparer advised her that she did not \nneed to file tax returns for years 2009, 2010, or 2012. (SOR response; Tr. 27-31) \nAfter Applicant received her July 2023 SOR, she realized that she still needed to \nfile her tax returns for 2009, 2010, and 2012, despite the advice she had been given by \nthe tax preparer. She was able to get her tax documents from her ex-husband, and she \nhired a tax service in August 2023. By the end of 2023, her Federal and state tax returns \nfrom 2009, 2010, and 2012 were filed. She paid in full Federal back taxes owed for 2010 \nwhich totaled $1,673. If filed timely she could have received state tax refunds for tax years \n2009 and 2012. She does not believe she will owe any back taxes for the other tax years \nbased on what the tax service told her, but she has money saved if she is otherwise \nnotified by the IRS or state tax authority. She stated that she has filed all tax returns timely \nsince 2018, and she never will allow herself to file her tax returns late again. She is \nfinancially responsible, and she feels a sense of pride concerning her current financial \nand tax status. (SOR response; Tr. 31-34; AE A, B, C and D) \nCharacter References \nTwo character references, a project manager and a technical illustrator from \nApplicant\u2019s current place of employment, provided character reference letters. They \ndescribed Applicant as a hard worker, reliable, and responsible. They both stated that \nApplicant provides important graphic art contributions to keep U.S. soldiers safe.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions that she failed to timely file her Federal and state income \ntax returns for 2009, 2010, and 2012 support the application of AG \u00b6 19(f). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant is fully aware that she is responsible for filing annual Federal and state \nincome tax returns, but due to a divorce, unemployment, underemployment, and health \nissues, which were all circumstances beyond her control, she was unable to comply with \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthis requirement. When she obtained a permanent position in February 2019 with her \ncurrent employer, she immediately took corrective action by getting her delinquent income \ntax returns filed and back taxes repaid. She has been fully compliant in filing her tax \nreturns in a timely manner since 2018. \nApplicant\u2019s tax preparer gave her bad advice by telling her that she was not \nrequired to file returns for the tax years 2009, 2010, and 2012. When she received the \nJuly 2023 SOR, however, she immediately realized that her tax preparer was wrong. In \nAugust 2023, she worked with her ex-husband and was able to file the Federal and state \ntax returns for those years. She owed Federal back taxes for 2010, which she paid. She \ndoes not believe she will owe any other back taxes, but in the event she receives a \nstatement from a tax authority, she has money saved so she can take care of it right \naway. Applicant has learned a valuable lesson and will timely file all of her income tax \nreturns in the future. \nUnder the current circumstances, there are clear indications that Applicant\u2019s tax \nproblem is resolved. Her failure to timely file her Federal and state income tax returns \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nher current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and the AG \u00b6 2(d) factors in this \nwhole-person analysis. \nThe Federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in persons granted access to classified information. In deciding whether to \ngrant or continue access to classified information, the Federal government can take into \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naccount facts and circumstances of an applicant's personal life that shed light on the \nperson's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, security clearance \ndecisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct during work or duty \nhours. Even if an applicant has a good work record, his or her off-duty conduct or \ncircumstances can have security significance and may be considered in evaluating the \napplicant's national security eligibility. \nApplicant took responsible action to file her delinquent Federal and state income \ntax returns when she found suitable employment with a decent wage. All of her tax returns \nare filed and there is no evidence that she owes any back taxes. She provided \nemployment character references who state that she is hard worker, responsible, and \nreliable. After evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 58 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1999 and a master\u2019s degree in 2004. He has about 24 years of Army service, including active duty both in enlisted service (1986-1990) and as a commissioned officer (1990-2001), and in the Reserve from 2001 until he retired honorably as a major in 2010. Since late 2011, he has been employed in the human resources (HR) field, for a variety of employers in the private sector. He was unemployed for several months in mid-2018 due to a reduction in force. He began working for his current employer and clearance sponsor in about May 2021. He held a clearance during all his years in the Army as well as more recently. He currently earns $41 an hour and works full time. (GE 2, GE 4; Ph. Ex. 2, Ph.

(GE 2) That application was granted in January 2022. In July 2022, he submitted an updated SCA, in applying for top secret level access, which he needs to become a Facility Security Officer (FSO).

The \ncase was assigned to me on May 22, 2024. On June 5, 2024, DOHA issued a notice \nscheduling the hearing for July 2, 2024. The hearing was to occur by video teleconference \nthrough an online platform. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel submitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A through C. All exhibits were admitted without objection. I left the record \nopen until July 31, 2024, to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit additional exhibits. \nHe timely submitted seven documents, marked as Post-Hearing (PH) Exhibits (Ex.) 1 \nthrough 7, per his post-hearing exhibit list. They are all admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on July 11, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e with a brief narrative statement. He \nadmitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b without comment. His admissions are incorporated into the \nfindings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 58 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1999 and a master\u2019s \ndegree in 2004. He has about 24 years of Army service, including active duty both in \nenlisted service (1986-1990) and as a commissioned officer (1990-2001), and in the \nReserve from 2001 until he retired honorably as a major in 2010. Since late 2011, he has \nbeen employed in the human resources (HR) field, for a variety of employers in the private \nsector. He was unemployed for several months in mid-2018 due to a reduction in force. \nHe began working for his current employer and clearance sponsor in about May 2021. \nHe held a clearance during all his years in the Army as well as more recently. He currently \nearns $41 an hour and works full time. (GE 2, GE 4; Ph. Ex. 2, Ph. Ex. 3; Tr. 20, 41-45, \n61-62, 72-76, 101-102, 114) \nApplicant submitted an SCA in September 2021, an application for access to \nclassified information at the secret level. (GE 2) That application was granted in January \n2022. In July 2022, he submitted an updated SCA, in applying for top secret level access, \nwhich he needs to become a Facility Security Officer (FSO). He disclosed prior \nclearances from his time in the Army, in 1987 and 2002 on both SCAs, and added the \ngranting of his 2021 SCA, in January 2022, on his most recent SCA. GE 1; Tr. 26, 46-47, \n52, 113-114) \nApplicant\u2019s first two marriages (1989-2007 and 2008-2010) ended in divorce. He \nhas been married to his third wife since 2020. He has four grown children. (GE 1) \nApplicant and his wife are currently in the process of divorcing.

The debts are listed on credit reports from November 2021, \nJuly 2022, and May 2023. (GE 5, GE 6, and GE 7). \nApplicant said his divorce is due to the financial hardship resulting from several \nautomobile repossessions. He became financially overextended and could not pay all his \ndebts. He said he fell behind on his debts in 2019 or 2020. He also blamed his wife and \nsaid he trusted her financially and should not have. He said she has mental health issues \nand is bipolar. But he acknowledged that he is responsible for the debts. His plan is to \naddress his current debts first, reduce his revolving credit to zero, and then address his \nSOR past-due debts. (Tr. 30, 38-39, 48-50, 57, 70-71, 106-109) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($18,456) is an automobile financing account that has been charged off \nby Bank C. (GE 5, GE 9) Applicant purchased a jeep in about 2017 or 2018. He said his \nthird wife spent the money allocated to the car payments, and about a year later, before \nthey separated, the vehicle was repossessed. (PH Ex. 7; Tr. 62-65, 91-92) Applicant said \nduring the hearing that he expected to be found responsible for only one half of this marital \ndebt in the parties\u2019 anticipated divorce settlement agreement. (Tr. 40-41, 109) However, \nthe signed July 2024 separation agreement about distribution of marital assets and debts \nreflects that he is now responsible for this debt in full. (PH Ex. 7) This debt remains \npending. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($7,769) is an account for past-due rent that has been charged off by \nan apartment complex where Applicant and his third wife lived from about 2020 to 2022.\n(GE 5, GE 6; Tr. 63, 65) Applicant broke the lease after she moved out. As of June 2022, \nApplicant was paying a debt collector $150 per pay period, but he did not make many of \nthe payments. He has not made payments for about a year, and now owes $7,994. (GE \n8, GE 9; Tr. 65-66) He said during the hearing that he expected to be found responsible \nfor only one half of this marital debt. (Tr. 30-36, 66, 92, 109) However, Applicant is now \nresponsible for this debt, according to the July 2024 settlement agreement he and his \nwife signed relating to their post-divorce distribution of marital assets and debts. (PH Ex. \n7) This account remains unresolved.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($7,301) is an account that has been charged off by an automobile \nfinancing company. (GE 5, GE 6, GE 7) This account was for a car Applicant purchased \nin June 2019, during his third marriage. The amount alleged is what he owes after the car \nwas repossessed and sold at auction in early 2021. As of June 2022, Applicant was \nattempting to contact the creditor to arrange a repayment plan, but he was not successful \nsince the debt was charged off. He has made no payments and has no arrangement in \nplace because he said the creditor will not accept a payment plan. (GE 8; Tr. 39-40, 66-\n68, 107) This account remains pending.  \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($7,255) and 1.e ($3,910) are two accounts that have been charged \noff by the same creditor, Credit Union 1. (GE 5, GE 6, GE 7) The first account is for a jet \nski Applicant purchased and the second is for a credit card. He was employed by Credit \nUnion 1 at the time.

(Tr. 36-38, 69-72, 107-109) \nAfter the hearing, Applicant reengaged with debt collector G to repay three past-\ndue accounts with Credit Union 1. The two SOR accounts are likely included, though this \nis not entirely clear. The third account, for a second repossessed car, is not alleged. (Tr. \n82-84-85, 92-93; GE 9) As of July 2024, he owed $3,732, $11,935, and $5,914 on the \nthree accounts, respectively, for a combined total of $21,581. In mid-August 2024, he was \nto begin paying $200 twice a month. (PH Ex. 6) These accounts are not resolved. \nAE A is an excerpt from a June 2024 credit report or credit monitoring service. It \nshows that Applicant has about $8,000 in credit card debt. One of the debts, a military \ncredit account, had a listed balance of $6,876, later reduced to $6,320. (AE A, AE B; Tr. \n15, 27-29) Applicant noted the absence of any automobile loan, student loan, or \nmortgage. (AE A; Tr. 27, 76-79) He said he had about $120,000 in student loans but he \nsaid this debt it was largely forgiven through the U.S. government\u2019s public service loan \nforgiveness program. (Tr. 27, 49-51, 53-54) He said he was aggressively working to pay \ndown his overall debt load over the last 12 months. (Tr. 57) \nApplicant also disclosed that he has a balance of about $20,000 in past-due federal \nincome tax debt for tax year 2022. He said this is due to under withholding and because \nhis wife would not file jointly with him. He learned of the debt about four months before \nthe hearing, when he filed his 2023 taxes, and he has been making $300 payments per \npay period since then to resolve the balance. He has no unfiled federal income tax returns \nand his home state has no state income tax requirements. (Tr. 81-82, 92-95) \nThe day after the hearing, Applicant was to move into a one-bedroom apartment. \nHe lived in his prior home, a room rental in a house, for six months, paying $800 in monthly \nrent. In the past, he has also lived on a houseboat, paying slip rent of $600 a month (Tr. \n2, 55, 76, 111-113) He has about $2,000 in his checking account and about $7,000 in a \nretirement account. He has not pursued formal credit counseling but he has a financial \naccountant who will assist him going forward. He keeps his household budget on a \nspreadsheet. (Tr. 96-100) \nApplicant did not disclose any delinquent debts on his September 2021 SCA. (GE \n2) After his 2021 SCA, he had a background interview on or about December 9, 2021. \nThe interview summary reflects that, when he was asked about the questions in Section \n26 of the 2021 SCA, about his financial record, he \u201creadily provided\u201d information various \ndelinquencies. (GE 3 at 5; Tr. 83-84) Further, when asked why he had not listed his \nfinancial issues on his 2021 SCA, Applicant replied that he had. The summary reflects \nthat Applicant \u201cthen held up his version of the [2021 SCA], which showed detailed financial \ninformation listed on the SF-86.\u201d Automobile repossessions and a charged-off credit card \naccount were listed. Applicant was requested by the interviewing agent to provide a copy \nof that portion of his 2021 SCA.

He accepted blame for any misunderstanding \nand said he did not intend to deceive or intentionally omit any information about his \nfinancial circumstances. He discussed the delinquent status of several of his accounts. \n(GE 3 at 7) He had another interview on or about December 21, 2021. The summary \nreflects that he provided a copy of the \u201cfinancial details in Section 26 of his SF-86,\u201d as \nrequested in his first interview. During his testimony, Applicant affirmed the interview \nsummaries, but he stated he no longer has a copy of his version of the 2021 SCA he \nshowed during his later interviews. (GE 3 at 8) \nApplicant\u2019s secret clearance was granted in about January 2022. (GE 2). In July \n2022, Applicant submitted an updated SCA, for top secret access. (GE 1) As with his \n2021 SCA, he did not disclose any financial delinquencies in answer to any questions \nunder Section 26 (Financial Record) on his July 2022 SCA. These omissions are the basis \nfor the Guideline E allegations in the SOR. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b) In his SOR response, \nApplicant admitted these allegations without further comment. \nDuring his testimony, Applicant acknowledged that he had charged off debts that \nhe should have listed on his 2021 SCA, but he said he did not list them because he \nthought they were closed. As to his 2022 SCA, he said he researched his credit report at \nthe time but looked only at open accounts, not closed accounts. He accepted full \nresponsibility for his responses on both SCAs. He acknowledged his error but said there \nwas no intent to deceive the government by failing to disclose his debts on his 2022 SCA. \n(Tr. 59-60, 90-91) \nApplicant handles several million dollars in annual payroll. He has also been an \nassistant facility security officer (AFSO) for the last three years. He assists employees in \nthe clearance application process among other security responsibilities. He tells \nclearance applicants about the importance of completeness and accuracy and \u201cto leave \nnothing out.\u201d (Tr. 25-26, 103-105) After the hearing, he documented appropriate security \ntrainings for his job. (Tr. 105-106; PH Ex. 5) \nApplicant retired as a major (O-4). He earned three Meritorious Service Medals, \nfour Army Commendation Medals, the Joint Service Achievement Medal, three Army \nAchievement Medals, and appropriate service medals. (PH Ex. 2 - 4) He said his military \nretirement pay and disability compensation is a combined $4,755 a month. (Tr. 102-103) \nApplicant is proud of his service to the country, both in and out of uniform, and of \nhis many years with a clearance. He understands that his finances are \u201ca mess\u201d but says \nhe plans to get them under control, and he asks that the \u201cwhole person\u201d be considered. \n(Tr. 60-61, 115-116, 125) \nThe company president of Applicant\u2019s current employer attested to his exceptional \ncompetence, integrity, and reliability.

(Ph. Ex. 1) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of several variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The \nprotection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \n\u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn \nonly those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained \nin the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation \nor conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant fell behind on several accounts during his third marriage, now in divorce \nproceedings. They include several automobile repossessions and past-due rent. The \nSOR debts are listed on credit reports in the record, AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNo mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant became financially overextended \nand could not pay all his debts, beginning in about 2019 or 2020. His third wife\u2019s financial \nmismanagement and mental health issues may have played a role as well, but he \naccepted responsibility for the debts alleged. Applicant has not demonstrated that AG \u00b6 \n20(b) should fully apply. While he hoped that his wife would be held responsible for 50% \nof the debts in their settlement agreement, this did not come to pass, and he is fully \nresponsible for all of them. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. Applicant stressed his efforts to \nminimize his current debt load and said his plan is to address his current debts first, \nreduce his revolving credit to zero, and then address his SOR past-due debts. His SOR \ndebts are therefore ongoing and unresolved. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. And he has \ntaken little to no action thus far to address these debts. His plan to address his current \ndebts first is not sufficient evidence of good-faith action towards the creditors for his past-\ndue debts. Applicant needs to establish a documented track record of steady payments \ntowards these alleged debts in order to mitigate the security concern shown. AG \u00b6 20(d) \ndoes not apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations . . . determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant allegedly falsified his 2022 SCA \nby failing to disclose any of the SOR debts. He should have done so, given the wording \nof the financial questions under Section 26 of his 2022 SCA. However, I also credit the \nfact that the interview summary of Applicant\u2019s first interview (GE 3, in December 2021) \nshows that he \u201creadily provided\u201d the information when asked about it. He also provided \nhis own copy of his 2021 SCA to discuss with the interviewing agent \u2013 a document \nshowing he disclosed various delinquencies. While this copy of the 2021 SCA is not in \nthe record, the interview summary suggests that Applicant did not deliberately fail to \ndisclose those debts on his 2022 SCA, because his prior disclosures are not the acts of \nsomeone seeking to deceive the Government intentionally. While he should have been \nmore candid on his 2022 SCA, I cannot conclude that his omissions on that application \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwere deliberate. I make this finding notwithstanding the fact that he \u201cadmitted\u201d the SOR \nallegations in his SOR response without further comment. I conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) \ndoes not apply and find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in considering \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. \nI credit Applicant\u2019s long years of uniformed service to the country and his many \ndecorations. I also credit his other whole-person evidence of subsequent work, including \nfor his current employer in the HR and security fields. However, this does not outweigh \nthe security concerns shown by his history of delinquencies. His delinquent debts will \nremain a security concern until he shows a documented track record of good-faith efforts \nto resolve them. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude that while Guideline E personal conduct security concerns are not established, \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering all the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

His admissions are incorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 49 years old and was born in Iraq. From 1994 to 1999, he attended \ncollege in Iraq and earned his bachelor\u2019s degree. From about December 1999 through \nApril 2001, he completed mandatory military service in Iraq where, after three months of \nbasic training, he served as a civil engineer for a municipality in roadworks. (Answer; \nFORM Response; GX 5-6) \nApplicant\u2019s employment history from 2001 through mid-2003 is not detailed in the \nrecord. However, from about October 2003 through February 2006, he was employed \nas an engineer with construction companies working on infrastructure projects in Iraq for \nU.S. Government agencies. He received high praise from his superiors for the work he \ncompleted. (FORM Response; GX 6; AX C, AX E)  \nThis work was inherently dangerous. One of Applicant\u2019s supervisors stated that \ntwo security guards were shot during a project. Applicant also received at least two \ncredible threats. On one occasion, he was threatened by a local citizen while on a \nproject site. On the second occasion, after a fellow employee was attacked and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nkidnapped, Applicant was informed that insurgents had learned the names of everyone \non his team.

From about April \n2007 through December 2012, he worked as a civil engineer for an international \nconstruction company. From November 2011 through September 2012, he participated \nin a distance learning program where he earned a master\u2019s degree. (FORM Response; \nGX 5-6) \nIn 2010, Applicant submitted a Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) application to the \nUnited States where he documented the threats he had received while in Iraq and \nincluded a letter of recommendation from one of his previous supervisors. Applicant\u2019s \nSIV was approved and he entered the United States in June 2012. However, after \nestablishing his U.S. immigration status, he returned overseas. (FORM Response; GX \n5-6; AX D-E) \nThe record contains inconsistent statements from Applicant in relation to where \nhe resided after 2012. In his SCA, Applicant listed that, in January 2013 he moved back \nto Iraq where he lived through January 2014. He confirmed this residency during his \ninterviews with background investigators. However, in his Answer, he described living in \nthe UAE during this time and only visiting Iraq in 2013. In his Response to the FORM, \nhe detailed that he traveled back and forth to the UAE in 2012 and 2013 \u201cuntil I \ncompleted my contract there.\u201d He did not provide details of the referenced contract. \nHowever, in his SCA, he listed that he was unemployed from January 2013 through \nFebruary 2015. He claimed to have \u201cpermanently\u201d moved to the United States in \nOctober 2013. (Answer; FORM Response; GX 5-6) \nApplicant also stated that he met his eventual wife in 2013, but he did not specify \nwhether they met in Iraq or the United States. In 2014, following his return to the United \nStates, they married. She is now a dual citizen of Iraq and the United States. They have \ntwo children, ages six and nine, who are U.S. citizens. (Answer; FORM Response; \nGX 5-6) \nApplicant began working again, part-time, as a driver from February 2015 \nthrough December 2016. From August 2016 through August 2019, he attended \nadvanced studies part-time at an American university and earned a second master\u2019s \ndegree. From about December 2016 through early 2023, he maintained full-time \nemployment with a commercial contractor. He has been with his current employer, a \nDOD contractor, since about March 2023. (Answer; FORM Response; GX 5-6; AX A) \nIn January 2020, Applicant naturalized as a U.S. citizen. However, he claimed he \nlost his original certificate and a new certificate was issued showing that he naturalized \nin October 2022. He has not renounced his Iraqi citizenship.

She previously worked as an \nArabic instructor in the United States but is now retired. (Answer; FORM Response; GX \n5-6; AX F) \nApplicant stated that he pays his taxes, votes and maintains a \u201cclean record\u201d in \nthe United States.

U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for \nviolence and kidnapping. Terrorist and insurgent groups regularly attack both Iraqi \nsecurity forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. militias threaten U.S. citizens and international \ncompanies throughout Iraq. Attacks using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) occur in \nmany areas of the country, including Baghdad. \nTerrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking \nU.S. citizens in Iraq. Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, also known as ISIS, ISIL, or Da\u2019esh \nis a designated terrorist organization. ISIS and its associated terrorist groups \nindiscriminately commit attacks and violent atrocities in Iraq despite improved Iraqi \ngovernment control. ISIS, militia groups, and criminal gangs target U.S. citizens for \nattacks and hostage-taking. There have been significant human rights issues in Iraq, \nincluding: credible reports of unlawful or arbitrary killings; extrajudicial killings and forced \ndisappearances by the government; torture and cruel, inhumane, and degrading \ntreatment by the government; and arbitrary arrest and detention. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \n\u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nclassified information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them, and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or classified information or technology and the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nThe mere possession of close family ties with relatives living in a foreign country \nis not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant, his \nor her spouse, or someone sharing living quarters with them, has such a relationship \nwith even one person living in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient to create \nthe potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of \nclassified information. ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009). \nAdditionally, the nature of a nation's government, including its level of control, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human-rights record are relevant in \nassessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members and foreign contacts are \nvulnerable to coercion or inducement. ISCR Case No. 17-04208 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, \n2019). \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(f) require evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d \nrequired to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. It \ndenotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living \nunder a foreign government or owning property in a foreign country. The totality of \nApplicant\u2019s ties to a foreign country as well as each individual tie must be considered. \nA heightened security risk is established by the administratively noticed facts \nabout Iraq, especially the human rights concerns, risks of terrorism, and ongoing \ninstability. Applicant maintains regular contact with his two brothers (B1 and B2) who \nare citizens and resident of Iraq. Applicant\u2019s third brother (B3) also maintains his Iraqi \ncitizenship and works in the neighboring country of Saudi Arabia. Applicant\u2019s father-in-\nlaw, while long retired, previously worked as an Iraqi police officer. Applicant\u2019s \nconnections to Iraq are sufficient to establish security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n7(b).  \nApplicant also maintains a property interest, shared with his brothers, in the \nfamily home in Iraq. While the value of the property is unknown, it is substantial enough \nthat Applicant has expressed an ongoing desire to protect it and stated that it is the \nreason he has maintained his Iraqi citizenship. Security concerns under AG \u00b6 7(f) are \nestablished. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns under Guideline \nB, including the following which are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nFrom about October 2003 through 2006, Applicant worked on several \ninfrastructure projects in Iraq on behalf of U.S. Government interests. He received at \nleast two credible threats during that work. For his service, his SIV application was \napproved and he immigrated to the United States in 2012. Even though it is unclear \nwhether he lived in Iraq or UAE in 2013, he has lived in the United States since at least \n2014 and has not returned to Iraq. He has obtained an advanced degree and is \ndeveloping his career in the United States. His wife is a U.S. citizen and both of his \nchildren are native-born U.S. citizens. His in-laws are also U.S. citizens. These are all \nfactors that weigh in Applicant's favor. \nComparatively, all five of Applicant\u2019s brothers live outside of the United States. \nHe has two brothers who still reside in Iraq and he communicates with them regularly. \nHaving previously been threatened himself while in Iraq, Applicant has acknowledged \ngeneral safety concerns for his brothers since the living situation in Iraq is difficult. An \napplicant who has already been identified and threatened, possibly by a terrorist \norganization, is someone who may well encounter such threats in the future and thereby \nbe pressured to compromise national security information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-02862 at 4 (App. Bd. May 22, 2018); ISCR Case No. 22-00364 at 4 (June 22, 2023). \nB3 also lives and works in neighboring Saudi Arabia and maintains his Iraqi citizenship. \nApplicant has not provided sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that he has ties \nof affection for, or obligation to, these three brothers. Additionally, he has not provided \nsufficient evidence to find that it is unlikely that he will be placed in a position of having \nto choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or \ngovernment and the interests of the Unites States. None of the mitigating conditions are \napplicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant also maintains an interest in property in Iraq. Despite his statements \nthat he will soon reach a settlement with his brothers, he still maintains his Iraqi \ncitizenship to protect his financial interest in this property. Although the financial value of \nthe property is unknown, he has not established that this interest is such that it is \nunlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, \nor pressure him. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is a U.S. citizen residing in the United States. \nWhile he previously worked as an Iraqi police officer, he retired in 1993 and has not \nreturned to Iraq since immigrating to the Unites States in 2009. He maintains no \nongoing connection to the Iraqi government and no defined ties to Iraq. It is unlikely that \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his father-in-law will place Applicant in a position of having \nto choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group or government and the \ninterests of the Unites States. AG \u00b6 8(a) is applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant did not request a hearing and I did not have the opportunity to question \nhim further about his family connections to Iraq or to assess his credibility by observing \nhis demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). However, \nthe record reflects that Applicant previously received threats while working in Iraq on \nbehalf of U.S Government interests. Following the approval of an SIV application, he \nhas resided in the United States since 2014. His wife is a U.S. citizen and they have two \nyoung children who are U.S. citizens. He has stated that he is committed to raising his \nfamily in the United States. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nStill, Applicant has a close relationship with his five brothers, all of whom live \noutside of the United States. Two of these brothers still face the challenges of living in \nIraq where conditions place them at a heightened risk. Also, Applicant has yet to resolve \nhis interest in the family property in Iraq that he clearly values. \nWhile there is nothing unusual about Applicant\u2019s relationship with his family \nmembers in Iraq, his present circumstances are such that he could be placed in an \nuntenable position of having to choose between the interests of a loved one and the \nUnited States. \u201cApplication of the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s \npatriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways \nwhen faced with choices that could be important to a loved-one, such as a family \nmember.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009). Based on the \nfacts and circumstances before me, concerns of undue foreign influence persist. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant did \nnot mitigate the foreign influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 28 years old. She attended high school from 2011 to 2015 and earned a certificate for general education development (GED) in 2017. She has worked for her current employer, a healthcare company, since about July 2020 as a customer service representative at a call center. She requires a trustworthiness determination for her job. She works remotely from home. She earns about $25 an hour. She works full time, and often works overtime. She has never married and has no children. She lives alone in her own apartment.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto sensitive information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 6, 2021, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (application) in connection with her employment in the \ndefense industry, for a position of public trust and eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation. On August 3, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudication Services (DCSA CAS) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant detailing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations) and Guideline I (psychological conditions).

She included one document, later marked and \nadmitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A. The case was assigned to the Department \nCounsel\u2019s office on September 15, 2023. On September 22, 2023, the assigned \nDepartment Counsel requested a hearing in the case, under paragraph E.3.1.7 of the \nAdditional Procedural Guidance of DOD Directive 5220.6. Department Counsel notified \nApplicant of the Government\u2019s request for a hearing on the same day. She also \nprovided Applicant copies of the Government\u2019s proposed exhibits in the case. (Hearing \nExhibits (HE) I, II, and III; Tr. 7-8, 15). \nThe case was assigned to me on May 22, 2024. On July 17, 2024, DOHA issued \na notice scheduling the hearing to be held on August 13, 2024, by video-teleconference \nvia an online platform. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 6. All but GE 3 were admitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s objection to \nadmission of GE 3 was overruled. (Tr. 15-25) After the hearing, Department Counsel \nsubmitted GE 7, a current credit report. It was admitted without objection. Applicant \ntestified and submitted exhibits AE A-1 and AE B through AE G, all of which were \nmarked and admitted without objection. I held the record open to allow her the \nopportunity to submit additional documentation. She timely submitted seven additional \ndocuments, which are marked as AE H through AE N and admitted without objection. \nThey are identified on Applicant\u2019s post-hearing exhibit list and in the Facts section, \nbelow. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 23, 2024. The record \nclosed on September 3. 2024. (Tr. 84) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted each of the three SOR allegations, \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 2.a, with \nexplanations. Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 28 years old. She attended high school from 2011 to 2015 and \nearned a certificate for general education development (GED) in 2017. She has worked \nfor her current employer, a healthcare company, since about July 2020 as a customer \nservice representative at a call center. She requires a trustworthiness determination for \nher job. She works remotely from home. She earns about $25 an hour. She works full \ntime, and often works overtime. She has never married and has no children. She lives \nalone in her own apartment. (GE 1; AE K; Tr. 31-34, 38, 48-49, 82-83) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline I \nDuring her September 2021 background interview, Applicant also revealed that \nshe was voluntarily hospitalized for three days for depression at Hospital G in May \n(actually, March) 2021, and diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She was given instructions \nto follow up with a doctor but did not do so because she felt \u201cok\u201d and did not think she \nneeded additional care. She did not list the hospitalization on her application because \nshe did not think she had a disability and did not understand that she should have \ndisclosed it. (GE 1 at 27-28, GE 2 at 3) \nIn October 2021, Applicant had another background interview to discuss \ndeveloped information about her history of illegal drug use. She began using marijuana \nin 2015, in high school. From then until 2021, including while in her current job, she \nused and purchased marijuana about twice a month. She often used marijuana to \naddress her periods of depression, anxiety, hallucinations, and paranoia. She believes \nshe became addicted to marijuana, but stopped using it in March 2021 after she was \nhospitalized. (GE 2 at 5; AE A-1; Tr. 37, 68-71, 77-78) \nApplicant did not disclose her drug use, discussed below, on her August 2021 \napplication because she did not think it was important or necessary to do so. (Tr. 74-75) \nShe testified that she provided a second application after she submitted GE 1. She later \nprovided documentation that it was rejected for various errors. (AE M) \nSubsequently, at DOD\u2019s request, Applicant participated in a psychological \nevaluation given her history of mental health issues and marijuana use. The evaluation \nwas conducted in March 2023, and the psychological report was provided in April 2023, \nby Dr. B, a licensed clinical psychologist (Ph.D.) and board-certified neuropsychologist. \n(GE 3, GE 6) \nApplicant\u2019s interview for her evaluation was conducted virtually, over Zoom. She \ncompleted a standard Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) and the evaluation met \nappropriate standards of care. Her developmental, educational, and occupational \nhistory were addressed. (GE 3 at 1-2, 4) \nIn discussing her mental health and substance abuse histories, Applicant \ndescribed longstanding intermittent visual and auditory hallucinations that she kept \nsecret through adolescence. She sought out a psychologist in 2021 due to depression \nand hallucinations. Outpatient treatment was unsuccessful, so she went voluntarily to \nHospital G. She said she had been compliant with medication prescribed by her primary \ncare physician since her discharge. (GE 3 at 2; Tr. 52; AE A-1; AE L) \nRecords from Hospital G, reviewed by Dr. B, indicate that Applicant presented at \nHospital G in March 2021 with symptoms of visual and command hallucinations, \nincluding to harm others. She admitted using marijuana. A \u201cBaker Act\u201d petition for \ninvoluntary hospitalization was filed. She was diagnosed by hospital medical providers \nwith unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychiatric disorder(s) and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhospitalized for three days. Upon discharge, she was diagnosed with unspecified \nschizophrenia. She was provided referrals for medication management and substance \nabuse intervention. (GE 3 at 2; GE 4; Tr. 53) (SOR \u00b6 1.a) Her omissions from her \napplication of her mental health conditions and drug abuse were noted by Dr. B, as was \nthe information Applicant provided in her background interviews. (GE 3 at 3) \nApplicant denied using marijuana since her hospitalization. She had not yet \nresearched treatment with a psychiatrist but planned to do so. (GE 3 at 3) Dr. B saw no \nevidence of ongoing substance abuse but noted prior marijuana use with a clearance or \nposition of public trust. (Note: This is not established, since Applicant submitted her \napplication for a position of public trust after she had last used marijuana. However, she \ndid use marijuana while in her current job). Her lack of candor about her drug history \nand mental health conditions on her application raises questions of trustworthiness. (GE \n3 at 3-4) \n \nDr. B diagnosed Applicant with schizoaffective disorder, depressive type (F25.1) \nand unspecified anxiety disorder. (F41.9), under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual \nof Mental Disorders, 5th  Edition (DSM-5). She was found to have a clear history of \npsychosis, occurring during depressive episodes but also in the absence of any mood \ndisturbance. Applicant reported being in remission but displayed negative symptoms of \ndepression. She also displayed anxiety. Dr. B found that Applicant was not in \nappropriate care for her condition. \u201cSchizoaffective disorder is a chronic condition that \ncannot be cured and requires pharmacotherapy throughout the lifetime.\u201d Even with \nproper medication, she is prone to breakthrough symptoms that will require adjustments \nto her regimen by a skilled specialist. (GE 3 at 4-5) (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \nApplicant said in the evaluation that she had not followed advice to pursue proper \npsychiatric care. Dr. B, concluded, \u201cHer mental health issues are clearly not in full \nremission. She is at risk of relapse of major depression, psychosis, and substance \nabuse.\u201d As a result, Dr. B had \u201csignificant concerns regarding her stability and \nreliability.\u201d (GE 3 at 4) She found that Applicant\u2019s behavior and conditions could impact \nher decision-making, ability to follow rules and regulations, and workplace behavior. Her \njudgment and insight are limited. Applicant is at risk of recurrence of symptoms that \ncould make her a danger to others, such as command hallucinations. (GE 3 at 4) \nDr. B recommended that Applicant follow through on her stated intentions to find \na psychiatrist in her insurance network. Dr. B has concerns about her treatment \ncompliance, and: \nUnless [Applicant] is consistently in treatment with a qualified professional \nto regularly monitor symptoms and provide the most empirically supported \ntreatment for schizophrenia and mood disorder, her prognosis will \ncontinue to be poor. (GE 4 at 4) \nRegarding her mental health issues, Applicant testified that she was living in a \nbad neighborhood and had a bad reaction to a \u201cdifferent strain\u201d of marijuana that she \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngot from her then live-in boyfriend. She recognized that \u201csomething\u2019s not right. I\u2019m \nmentally going crazy right now.\u201d She went to Hospital G for treatment and was admitted \nfor three days. Applicant said she has not used marijuana since \u201ca couple of months\u201d \nbefore her hospitalization in March 2021. (Since her bad reaction to the marijuana was \nwhat led to her hospitalization soon thereafter, this timeframe estimate is dubious). At \nthat time, she used marijuana every other week. She asserted that she was admitted to \nHospital G more due to the drug reaction than for mental health reasons. She said she \nhas not used marijuana since she was admitted. (Tr. 36-43, 71-72; AE A-1) \nHospital G providers recommended that Applicant see a psychologist. She \ndocumented that she visited Ms. D, a provider with medical provider L, in April and May \n2021, by video. (AE L) She has not seen any provider for psychological or psychiatric \ncare since then. She asserted that she could call her primary care provider at any time if \nshe felt the need to. (Tr. 44-47) Applicant denied telling the evaluator that she would \nharm others. She also denied being prescribed any medication. (Tr. 42-43, 53-54) \nApplicant recalled telling Hospital G providers about \u201ca dark figure\u201d that \nsometimes talk to her, and if she says a certain word, she must repeat it over and over. \nShe would use marijuana to cope with the hallucinations and voices. (Tr. 55; Answer; \nAE A-1) She did not pursue subsequent drug treatment or counseling, despite a \nrecommendation to do so. (GE 4 at 5; Tr. 65-66) She has not used any illegal drug \nbesides marijuana and has not used marijuana since her hospitalization. (Tr. 68, 71-72) \nApplicant acknowledged that Hospital G providers recommended follow-up care, \nwhich she set up for April and May 2021, through provider L. Those providers \nprescribed medication. She took the medication daily for a period but has not been on \nany medications since some time after her March 2023 evaluation. She stopped taking \nmedications because she felt she does not need them anymore. She said she told her \nprimary care provider (PCP) that she was stopping the medication. She does have the \nmedications and can take them as needed. She uses other coping mechanisms like \ngoing to the beach, the gym, being outside, and pursuing arts and crafts hobbies. She is \nclose to her family members, who live nearby. They know of her diagnoses and are \nsupportive of her. (Answer; Tr. 56-66, 72) \nApplicant has health insurance and a PCP whom she sees regularly, as recently \nas July 2024. Her PCP is aware of her mental health issues. She has not seen a mental \nhealth provider since May 2021 and does not have documentation of an evaluation to \nrebut or update the DOD evaluation. She is working on paying off her debts and working \novertime. She wants to see a provider that has a similar ethnic background and has \nbegun researching providers in her insurance network. She denied any hallucinations \nsince taking the \u201cdifferent strain\u201d of marijuana in early 2021. She denied any issues with \nbeing able to care for herself properly. She does not believe that she has a \nschizoaffective or other disorder, though she acknowledged depression.

She attested that she \nhas been clean (sober) and has not used marijuana for almost five years. (This \nsuggests she has not used marijuana since mid-2019 \u2013 well before she went to Hospital \nG after having a bad reaction to marijuana in March 2021.) She attested that she does \nnot tolerate being around anyone who uses drugs. She is willing to take a drug test. She \nsaid she is financially stable since her bankruptcy and manages her finances well. She \nasserted that her mental health is \u201cwonderful.\u201d She can seek mental health assistance \nanytime, has a healthy lifestyle, and gets good support from family and friends. (AE H) \nPost-hearing, Applicant also documented her visits to mental health provider L in \nApril and May 2021, and provided references to email statements from late 2023 and \nearly 2024, but it is not clear that they concern more recent visits. (AE L) She \ndocumented a post-hearing counseling session with a mental health provider in August \n2024. (AE N) \nGuideline F \nApplicant disclosed on her August 2021 application that she had filed a Chapter \n7 bankruptcy petition in August 2020, and that it was discharged in June 2021. (GE 1 at \n31; GE 5) (SOR \u00b6 2.a) In her background interview in September 2021, she discussed \nher recent bankruptcy and her improved financial situation. GE 2 at 1-2) \nApplicant explained during her testimony that in about 2020, she had lost her job \nand fell behind on her debts, including a car, a cell phone, and a credit card. She was \nfinancially na\u00efve. Filing for bankruptcy allowed her to start fresh. She participated in \ncredit counseling and learned how to manage money better. She now has an affordable \nmonthly rent, car, and phone payments ($234 and $27), no credit cards and little other \ndebt. She has a budget and is confident in her ability to stick to it. (Answer; AE A-1; AE \nD, AE F; Tr. 34-36, 49-51, 73) An August 2024 credit report noted several debts that \nhad been discharged in the bankruptcy but no new delinquencies. (GE 7) \nAfter the hearing, Applicant provided a personal financial statement. She \nindicated that she had a monthly income of about $2,664 and monthly expenses of \n$2,307, for a monthly remainder of about $350. (AE J) She provided recent paystubs to \ncorroborate her income. (AE K) \nApplicant has been recognized by her employer for her for hard work and \ndedication. She has had no workplace issues. (Answer; Tr. 47; AE H) She is regarded \nas \u201chighly effective.\u201d (AE A) She was promoted in 2023 and her supervisor noted that \nshe is an asset to the team and provides much value. (AE E; AE G) \nApplicant documented that her company has informed employees that the \ncompany has lost its government contract. Employees will be laid off by the end of the \nyear (December 2024), if not sooner.

As the Supreme Court held in Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that \n[trustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe trustworthiness concern for psychological conditions is set forth in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 28. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nApplicant used marijuana regularly since high school and well into her 20s, up to \nMarch 2021, when she sought mental health treatment at Hospital G after experiencing \na bad reaction to the drug. She was hospitalized for three days with symptoms of visual \nand command hallucinations, including to harm others. She was diagnosed with \nunspecified schizophrenia.

Dr. B, a \nDOD-approved psychologist, diagnosed Applicant with schizoaffective disorder, \ndepressive type (F25.1) and unspecified anxiety disorder. (F41.9). Dr. B noted that \nApplicant has a clear history of psychosis, occurring during depressive episodes but \nalso in the absence of any mood disturbance. Dr. B found that Applicant was not in \nappropriate care for her condition. \u201cSchizoaffective disorder is a chronic condition that \ncannot be cured and requires pharmacotherapy throughout the lifetime.\u201d Even with \nproper medication, she is prone to breakthrough symptoms that will require adjustments \nto her regimen by a skilled specialist. \nDr. B found that Applicant\u2019s mental health issues are \u201cclearly not in full remission. \nShe is at risk of relapse of major depression, psychosis, and substance abuse.\u201d As a \nresult, Dr. B had \u201csignificant concerns regarding her stability and reliability.\u201d (GE 3 at 4) \nDr. B. found that Applicant\u2019s behavior and conditions could impact her decision-making, \nability to follow rules and regulations, and workplace behavior. Applicant\u2019s judgment and \ninsight are limited. She is at risk of recurrence of symptoms that could make her a \ndanger to others, such as command hallucinations. (GE 3 at 4) \nDr. B recommended that Applicant follow through on her stated intentions to find \na psychiatrist in her insurance network. Dr. B has concerns about her treatment \ncompliance, and without regular and proper treatment from a qualified professional, she \nhas a poor prognosis. \nAppellant\u2019s behavior satisfies AG \u00b6 28(a), and her March 2021 hospitalization \nsatisfies AG \u00b6 28(c). Dr. B\u2019s mental health evaluation and diagnosis of Applicant\u2019s \nconditions satisfies AG \u00b6 28(b). Applicant briefly attended counseling in April and May \n2021 after her discharge from Hospital G, but soon stopped going. She also stopped \ntaking her prescribed medications. AG \u00b6 28(d) applies. \nAG \u00b6 29 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nDr. B\u2019s evaluation includes a recommendation that Appellant follow up on her \nstated plan to pursue mental health counseling. She has not done so, save for a single \nappointment after the hearing. She is not on any appropriate medication for her \nconditions, which are chronic, lifelong, and likely to require regular monitoring by a \nspecialist. The fact that Applicant does not believe she has a mental health disorder and \nfeels \u201cwonderful\u201d is not remotely enough to overcome Dr. B\u2019s conclusions. Applicant is \nnot currently in regular counseling or treatment and is not currently taking appropriate, \nprescribed medication. She asserts, without support, that her condition is essentially in \nremission. She did not provide an updated mental health evaluation to document this. \nNo mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe financial considerations guideline sets forth several conditions that could \nraise trustworthiness concerns under AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant fell behind on her financial obligations in 2020 after experiencing \nemployment instability. She filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection, and her debts \nwere discharged in 2021. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply, even though there was no \nevidence that she had any delinquencies at the time the SOR was issued. \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations trustworthiness concerns \nare provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control.  \nApplicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 in 2020 when she became \nfinancially overextended after experiencing employment instability. Her debts were \ndischarged in 2021. She participated in credit counseling through the bankruptcy \nproceeding and has not had any financial issues or delinquencies since then. She \nmanages her finances appropriately and has good credit. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(c) \napply to mitigate financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nposition of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and I in my whole-person analysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s whole-person \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nevidence from her work-related character references and documentation and also her \nfamily members. \nThe financial conditions trustworthiness concerns are resolved as there is no \nevidence of any current debts and Applicant has established financial responsibility and \nstability. However, the trustworthiness concerns over her ongoing, long-term, chronic \nand untreated mental health conditions and behaviors are not resolved. \nFurther, there is the matter of Applicant\u2019s history of marijuana use, which is also \nlong-term, regular, fairly recent, and which resulted in hospitalization. She also failed to \ndisclose either her drug use or her mental health conditions and hospital treatment on \nher application. There were no trustworthiness concerns alleged in the SOR under \neither Guideline H (Drugs) or Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Nevertheless, these \naggravating circumstances significantly undercut any showing of mitigation. They also \nnegatively impact Applicant\u2019s credibility. I also did not find her testimony about either the \nthe timeframe of her drug use or her limited self-awareness of her ongoing mental \nhealth issues to be credible. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant  \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant access to sensitive information. Eligibility \nfor a public trust position is denied. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n12 \n",

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern for drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse under AG \u00b6 25 and the following are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse. \nThe record evidence shows Applicant has a of history of habitual marijuana use \nfrom 2014 to the present. He uses marijuana every other night and admits to purchasing \nmarijuana from his state medical marijuana dispensary. He intends to continue using \nmarijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) apply. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana is legal in the state where he resides, it remains \nillegal under Federal law. On October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued an October 25, 2014, memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to state \nlaw (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not alter the \nnational security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of federal law \nconcerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant when making \neligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions raise security \nconcerns under Guideline H. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6E3.1.15) An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, \n2005)) \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 potentially apply: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence on actions taken to overcome this \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to:  1. Disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; 2. \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and 3. \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.  \nNeither mitigating condition applies. Applicant has used marijuana several times \na week since 2014. His use is for medicinal purposes and it is legal in the state where he \nresides. However, it remains illegal under federal law. He intends to continue to use \nmarijuana on a regular basis in the future. He did not mitigate the concerns under Drug \nInvolvement and Substance Misuse. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H and the AG \u00b6 2(d) factors in this \nwhole-person analysis. \nI note that Applicant has been an employee with the same DOD contractor since \n2017 and he has been promoted to positions with more responsibility during that time. \nApplicant provided full disclosure about his marijuana use for medical purposes. While \nhis marijuana use was legal under state law, it remains illegal under federal law and raises \nsecurity concerns. Concerns under Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse are not \nmitigated. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

He \nis 70 years old. He married in January 1978, divorced in March 1978, remarried in June \n1979, divorced in July 1996, and married his current spouse in July 2005. He has three \nchildren, ages 50, 39, and 32. He served honorably in the U.S. military from June 1978 \nto July 1995. He previously worked as a telephone technician for a non-defense \ncontractor from February 2009 to March 2018. He has since worked in the same \ncapacity for his current employer, a defense contractor. He has never held a security \nclearance. He has owned his home since 2004.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c) The allegations are established by \nApplicant\u2019s admission in his Answer, his March 2023 background interview with an \nauthorized DOD investigator and credit bureau reports (CBRs) from December 2022 \nand July 2023. The most recent CBR from March 2024 does not reflect any delinquent \ndebts. (Items 2, 4-7) \nApplicant obtained the auto loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a in around 2012. He was late or \nunable to make payments toward the loan, and the debt was sent to a collection \ncompany in around 2016. He indicated in his background interview that he settled this \ndebt and made a final payment toward the settlement in June 2017. In his Answer, he \nstated that the debt was not delinquent, the creditor relieved him of further action on this \naccount, and the account was closed. He did not provide documentation to corroborate \nhis claim that he settled and paid this debt. (Items 2, 4-6) \nApplicant obtained the loan in SOR \u00b6 1.b in around 2015 to pay other debts. He \nwas late or unable to make payments toward the loan, and the debt was sent to a \ncollection company in around 2016. He indicated in his background interview that he \nunsuccessfully attempted to contact the original creditor on multiple occasions between \n2017 and 2018, when he stopped trying to do so. He believed the account was closed \nas he had not been contacted by a collection agency. Should that happen, he is willing \nto resolve this debt. In his Answer, he stated that the creditor \u201cbrought this account up to \ndate and it is no longer delinquent as of August 2023.\u201d He did not provide \ndocumentation to corroborate his claim that this debt has been resolved. (Items 2, 4-6) \nApplicant obtained the personal loan in SOR \u00b6 1.c between 2009 and 2015 to \npay other debts.

(Items 2, 4-6) \nDuring his background interview, Applicant attributed his delinquent debt to \nminimal income since 2008. He indicated that his financial situation was in good \nstanding since he began collecting his military retirement pay and social security \nbenefits in around 2021. He reported a monthly household net income of $8,612, which \nincludes a monthly net military retirement of $1,156 and a monthly net social security \nbenefit of $2,385. After expenses, he indicated his monthly net remainder was \napproximately $1,970. There is no evidence in the record that he has received financial \ncounseling. (Item 4) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government \nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered as relevant AG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \n\u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant has a history of not \npaying his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nOf the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, I have determined the following to be \nrelevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nLimited income is a condition beyond Applicant\u2019s control that contributed to his \ndelinquent debts; however, recently his income has increased, and he did not show that \nhe acted reasonably under the circumstances by providing documentation showing his \nefforts of debt resolution. It is reasonable for an administrative judge to expect an \napplicant to present documentary evidence showing resolution of specific debts. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). Merely waiting for a debt \nto drop off a credit report by the passage of time is not a factor in an applicant\u2019s favor. \nSee, e.g, ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001). \u201c[T]hat some debts \nhave dropped off his credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2016). \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has received credit counseling. There are not \nclear indications that his financial problems are being resolved or are under control. I \nfind that Applicant\u2019s ongoing financial problems continue to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are not \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

The contract provides for monthly payments for 51 months, with the \nlast payment on October 30, 2026. \nApplicant testified that she fell behind on her debt payments because she was \nhelping her parents pay their home mortgage loan and giving cash to her mother. When \nshe had insufficient funds in her checking account, she used credit cards for living \nexpenses, and her amount of debt snowballed until she could not pay all her debts. (Tr. \n26) \nThe evidence concerning the status of the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized \nbelow. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Bank debt charged off in January 2023 for $9,016. This debt was \nincurred in January 2022. (GX 5 at 11) It is included in Applicant\u2019s debt-resolution plan. \nShe submitted an account statement reflecting that a payment plan was active, but it does \nnot reflect the terms of the payment plan. (AX A at 14) On April 26, 2024, the day the \nrecord closed, she submitted a copy of an email stating that the debt had been settled, \nbut that a settlement letter might not be available for up to 25 days. (AX C) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: Car loan charged off in July 2022 for $9,037. This debt was not \nincluded in Applicant\u2019s plan. It was incurred in July 2021, when Applicant cosigned a loan \nfor a casual friend whom she did not know well. She knew the friend had bad credit, and \nshe offered to cosign a loan application. (Tr. 30-31) When the friend failed to make the \npayments, she made them for one or two months. After she became uncomfortable with \nthe arrangement, she asked the friend for a written document reflecting their agreement. \n(Tr. 33-34) The friend gave her a written promise to hold her harmless if he failed to make \nthe payments. He promised to refinance the car by March 2022, and he authorized her to \nrepossess the car if he failed to make the payments. (Answer to SOR) She has lost \ncontact with the friend and does not know where he lives. (Tr. 31) The debt is not resolved. \nShe did not know that the debt was delinquent until she saw it on her credit report. (Tr. \n29-30) She testified that she disputed the debt, but she did not provide documentary \nevidence of her dispute or the basis for it. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Credit-card account charged off in September 2022 for $8,049. \nApplicant opened this account in August 2017. It is included in her payment plan. Her \naccount statement from the plan does not reflect any payments, but it reflects that, as of \nApril 16, 2024, the debt was in litigation and not resolved.

It \nwas charged off in October 2022. It is included in her payment plan.

(Tr. 25) She has lived with her parents since \nJanuary 2019, and pays them monthly rent of $1,000. She has about $2,000 in savings. \n(Tr. 41) She pays her mother\u2019s cellphone bill and helps with other household expenses. \nBoth of her parents are employed.

(Tr. 43) \nApplicant has taken vacations out of the country four times in the last five years. \n(Tr. 41) The record does not reflect the costs or dates of those vacations. She testified \nthat she recently purchased a new compact SUV when her 13-year-old vehicle was no \nlonger serviceable, and her new car loan is for about $34,000.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nThe evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(e): consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative \ncash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other negative financial \nindicators. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s finances appear to have been under \ncontrol until she opened the credit-card account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d in June 2021; \ncosigned the friend\u2019s car loan application alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b in July 2021, opened the \naccount alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f in February 2022; and opened the account alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.g in February 2022. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b was charged off in July 2022. She hired \nthe debt-negotiation firm in August 2022. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g were \ncharged off in September 2022. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d was charged off in October \n2022, and the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was charged off in January 2023. \nThe delinquent car loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b was not the result of a condition \nlargely beyond her control. It was the product of a foolish and deliberate decision to cosign \na loan for a friend with bad credit. It was not the type of situation contemplated by this \nmitigating condition. Applicant submitted no evidence of any other conditions largely \nbeyond her control. Her financial assistance to her parents, who are both gainfully \nemployed, was voluntary and well-meaning, but not a condition beyond her control. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence that the debt-\nnegotiation law firm provides the type of financial counseling contemplated by this \nmitigating condition. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.g, which are \nbeing resolved. Although Applicant asserted in a post-hearing email that the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a has been settled, she provided no documentary evidence of the settlement. \nAn applicant who claims that a debt has been resolved is expected to provide \ndocumentary evidence to support that claim. See ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. \nBd. Oct. 19, 2016). \nThis mitigating condition is not established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, which \nis not included in her debt-negotiation plan and is not being resolved by any means \noutside the plan. It is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich are included in the debt-negotiation plan but have not been settled or included in \nany payment plans. \nEven if the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is eventually settled, as Applicant claimed, \nthat fact will not be sufficient to mitigate her long history of irresponsible spending. The \nestablishment of some mitigating evidence does not compel a favorable security-\nclearance decision. ISCR Case No. 11-14784 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014). Even if delinquent \ndebts are eventually settled, the circumstances underlying the debts are relevant for what \nthey may reveal about the applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance. ISCR Case No. 14-02394 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2015) In this case, the evidence reveals a pattern of irresponsible \nconduct that began almost three years ago and resulted in the debts alleged in the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Although Applicant testified that she disputed the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, she submitted no documentation of a dispute, and she did not \narticulate a reasonable basis for disputing the debt. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nher delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e and 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nLeRoy F.

(Item 3) She provided no information on whether she has a budget or \nmanages her finances. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nBecause Applicant requested an administrative determination on the record, I had no \nopportunity to evaluate her demeanor. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nWhen a security clearance aspirant seeks a security clearance from the DOD, \nshe must show that she has the necessary judgment to comply with all security rules \nand regulations in all locations. An excellent gauge of her judgment is how she handles \nher private affairs, specifically how she manages her financial obligations. If she \ndemonstrates irresponsibility by not paying her debts on time or not at all, there is a \ngood chance she will exhibit the same disqualifying behavior towards security rules that \nshe chooses not to follow. Adverse evidence from credit reports can usually meet the \nGovernment\u2019s obligation of proving delinquent debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-\n02403 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006) The Government credit reports establish that the debts listed in the SOR have \nbeen delinquent since between 2013 and 2022. The evidence shows that Applicant \nopened up additional credit-card accounts after earlier accounts had become \ndelinquent. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the\nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is\nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe June 2023 SOR shows that Applicant owed $10,234 to 17 creditors. Her \nfather paid more than $36,000 in unalleged student loans in July 2023, which is why the \naccounts are no longer delinquent. In August and September 2023, Applicant paid $339 \nto four of the listed SOR-creditors, but she still owes the creditors $9,895. As a general \nrule, the time when an applicant repays her debts is critical to the evaluation of whether \nan applicant has the judgment and trustworthiness required for eligibility for a security \nclearance or to occupy a sensitive position. The timing of Applicant\u2019s debt repayments \nof the student loans (July 2023) and making payments on four of the SOR-debts \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(August and September 2023) did not occur until after she received the SOR. She had \nbeen placed on notice in December 2022 and February 2023, that her delinquent debts \nwere a concern to the Government. Though several of the listed debts are dated, she \nstill owes all the debts.  The likelihood that the debts will remain delinquent in the future \ncontinue to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug.3, 2018) AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply.  \nApplicant receives some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) based on her \nunemployment between November 2022 and January 2023. Her employment record \nbefore November 2022, however, indicates that she was continuously employed since \nMarch 2014. Her record since January 2023 reflects that she has been working \nconsistently. Yet, she has provided negligible results of resolving any of the delinquent \ndebts. There is only limited evidence by Applicant of acting responsibly under the \ncircumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies when there is evidence of financial counseling and debts \nare being resolved or under control. Applicant mentioned her enrollment in a debt \nconsolidation service. However, except for the four payments to four of the listed \ncreditors, Applicant has provided no documentation about the service and their \nintentions for processing the other delinquent debts. Thirteen debts are not being \nresolved or under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) is not applicable. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply \nbecause Applicant is not engaged in a good-faith effort to repay her creditors. Applicant \nreceives no mitigating credit for her father\u2019s pay off of more than $36,000 in student loan \ndebt because she contributed nothing to the transaction. She probably hoped the payoff \ncould be interpreted as an elimination of a very large debt that substantially reduced \nApplicant\u2019s overall financial dilemma. \nThe lack of financial counseling or evidence of a written budget negates \napplicability of the first and second prongs of AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts \nare not being resolved or under control. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant, who is a 31-year-old single female living with her boyfriend, has not \nfurnished sufficient evidence to establish that her delinquent debts are being resolved or \nunder control. In Guideline F cases, the DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly held that, \nto establish her case in mitigation, an applicant must present a \u201cmeaningful track \nrecord\u201d of debt repayments that result in debt reduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-\n01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007) While an applicant is not required to show that every \ndebt listed in the SOR is paid, the applicant must show that she has a plan for debt \nresolution and has taken significant action to implement the plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006) From the record presented, Applicant\u2019s plan \nhas yielded miniscule results. Interpreting the evidence from a common-sense point of \nview, Applicant\u2019s ongoing financial problems and outstanding tax issues for 2021 have \nnot been mitigated.   \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.s: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

(Items 4-6) \nBeginning in October 2018, Applicant and his wife hired a debt consolidation \ncompany to help them settle their delinquent accounts. He claimed that he made $570 \nmonthly payments to this company to pay off his creditors, but he stopped making \npayments in about March 2020 because he was laid off from one of his jobs. (Item 4) \nIn January 2023, Applicant estimated that his budget reflected a deficit of about \n$545 every month. His daughters will occasionally help him and his wife with some of \ntheir expenses. He claimed that he would try to resolve his delinquent debts if he could, \nbut he cannot afford to do so. He reported that he does not have enough money to file \nbankruptcy, and he is mainly focused on paying for his wife\u2019s ongoing medical \nexpenses. Despite having several opportunities to do so, he provided no documents to \ncorroborate his debt resolution efforts or the current balances of the SOR debts. (Items \n4-6) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective within DOD on June 8, 2017. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has 10 delinquent debts that have been delinquent for years. The \nabove disqualifying conditions are raised. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing and therefore recent. The \nevidence does not provide clear indications that the debts are being resolved or are \nunder control. Moreover, he has a monthly budget deficit. I cannot find his financial \ndelinquencies are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) and AG \u00b6 20(c) do not apply. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies were caused by his and his wife\u2019s serious medical \nissues, as well as unemployment and underemployment. These causes were beyond \nhis control. However, he must also show that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances with respect to these debts. It is reasonable to expect Applicant to \npresent documentation about the resolution of specific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). He failed to provide documentary evidence that \nhe meaningfully addressed any of the SOR debts. At best, without documentary \ncorroboration, he claimed that he attempted to pay down these debts through a debt \nconsolidation company, but he stopped doing that about four years ago because he \ncould not afford the payments. He therefore did not provide sufficient evidence that he \nacted responsibly under the circumstances or made a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. While I am sympathetic to Applicant and his \nwife for their serious health problems and the lack of affordable healthcare options, he \nhas not provided sufficient evidence that he has meaningfully addressed his years-old \ndelinquent debts, or that he has a viable plan to do so. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant  \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Because Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in Guideline H, I will consider those admissions when analyzing the Guidelines \nE and J allegations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 36 years old. He graduated from high school in 2006. He married in \n2015 and has two children, ages 10 and 8. He has been employed by a federal contractor \nsince September 2022. (Item 2) \nIn November 2022 Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). \nHe disclosed he was terminated from his job in July 2020. He had worked for this \nemployer since April 2013. He was terminated because the employer had a zero-\ntolerance drug policy, and he tested positive marijuana on a random drug test. (Item 2) \nIn Applicant\u2019s SCA he admitted he used marijuana from December 2018 to May \n2022. He disclosed that he used it frequently from 2018 to 2020, and on and off after then \nuntil May 2022. He disclosed he was given a prescription for marijuana to help with \ndepression after he and his wife separated. He disclosed that he did not intend to use it \nin the future because \u201cI have no desire to go back to it. Things are good at home and \nwork again.\u201d He further disclosed he was happy with his current life situation and things \nthat \u201cwere bringing me down are no longer in my life/limited.\u201d (Item 2) \nApplicant was sent government interrogatories, which he responded to in July \n2023. He affirmed the accuracy of his interview and statements he made to a government \ninvestigator in January 2023 and adopted them as true and correct. (Item 3) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s interview with the government investigator, he stated he was \nterminated from his employment after he tested positive for marijuana. He said he used \nmarijuana almost daily from 2018 to July 2020 and then weekly or monthly after his \ntermination until May 2022. He said he used it to help his overall mood and depression \nand to help him relax. He used marijuana by himself or with his wife. They would put the \nchildren to bed and smoke marijuana to relax. He said from approximately 2019 to May \n2022, he obtained marijuana from a medical dispensary in his state. Before then he would \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nobtain it from friends. He told the investigator that he felt dependent on marijuana as a \nmeans to relax and help him sleep. It helped with his depression. He did not participate \nin any drug education classes or receive any type of drug treatment. \nThe government interrogatories provided the following inquiry and requested \nApplicant respond. It stated: \nMarijuana use remains illegal under Federal law and therefore use is \nprohibited for individuals who hold a security clearance with the Department \nof Defense. Please provide an update on your marijuana use and your \nfuture intentions regarding marijuana use. Will you submit to ceasing all use \nof marijuana to possess a Department of Defense security clearance and \nunderstand that any future use of illegal drugs will result in an immediate \nrevocation of your clearance?  \nApplicant checked the \u201cyes\u201d response, but he did not provide an update as to his use of \nmarijuana. (Item 3). He did not provide evidence that he had a prescription for marijuana \nuse issued by his state. No other evidence was provided. (Item 3) As noted above, \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM, so he provided no more recent information about \nany drug involvement. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about December 2018 to \nabout May 2022. He possessed and purchased marijuana. He was fired by his employer \nafter testing positive for marijuana during a random drug test. The above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (the Security Executive \nAgent (SecEA)) issued DNI Memorandum ES 2014-00674, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws \nProhibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d which states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines . . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nOn December 21, 2021, the SecEA promulgated clarifying guidance concerning \nmarijuana-related issues in security clearance adjudications. It states in pertinent part: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by an \nindividual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life to \ndetermine whether that individual\u2019s behavior raises a security concern, if at \nall, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by \nsigning an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in \nlight of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use \nwhile occupying a sensitive position or holding a security clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-\n86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nApplicant used marijuana daily from December 2018 to July 2020. He was fired \nfrom his job when he tested positive for marijuana use. His employer had a zero-tolerance \ndrug policy. This did not deter Applicant as he continued to use marijuana after his job \ntermination and until May 2022. He used marijuana with his wife in the evenings to help \nthem relax. The government interrogatories requested he provide an update about his \nmarijuana use. He did not provide an update but indicated his intent to cease using it in \nthe future by checking \u201cyes.\u201d He also had an opportunity to provide a response to the \nFORM to update whether he continued to abstain from marijuana use. He did not respond \nto the FORM. Therefore, he did not provide updated information about his current use or \nabout whether his wife continues to use marijuana in their home. He stated he was \nprescribed marijuana for depression but is doing better. He did not provide evidence that \nhe had a medical marijuana card or when he received it. Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to question him about \nhis illegal drug use or evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR \nCase No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). I am unable to conclude Applicant\u2019s \ndrug use was so long ago or happened under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. \nHis obvious continued association with his wife continues to raise a concern, since they \nused marijuana together. None of the above mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . .. \nApplicant was fired in 2020 from a job he held for seven years for testing positive \nfor marijuana. His employer had a zero-tolerance drug policy. He disclosed he was using \nmarijuana on a daily basis while employed from December 2018 until his termination. He \ncontinued using marijuana after his termination until May 2022. The SOR alleges his \ntermination for testing positive for marijuana under the personal conduct guideline. My \nanalysis under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse also applies under \nthe personal conduct guideline. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur;  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate the \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations.  \nApplicant\u2019s employer had a zero-tolerance drug policy. He reported that he used \nmarijuana daily from December 2018 until he was terminated from employment in July \n2020. He continued to use marijuana after he was fired. He said he used it to control his \nmoods and depression and also to relax. He has not provided evidence of positive steps \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto alleviate his moods or depression. He did not provide a diagnosis from a doctor or \nevidence that he was later prescribed marijuana for medical purposes. He obviously \ncontinues to associate with his wife with whom he used marijuana. It is unknown whether \nshe continues to use marijuana. His conduct was not minor and occurred over a \nsignificant period of time while he was employed. None of the above mitigating conditions \napply. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31, and the following is \npotentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant used marijuana from December 2018 to May 2022. He possessed and \npurchased marijuana. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s uses and purchases of marijuana were cross-alleged under Guideline\nH. The same analysis applies to the criminal conduct concerns. Applicant has not \nprovided an update as to his current marijuana possession and use. He did not provide \nevidence that he was prescribed marijuana for medicinal purposes. This use is still in \nviolation of federal law but could be considered in mitigation. His failure to follow the rules \nof his employer by using marijuana daily from December 2018 until he tested positive in \nJuly 2020 raises concerns about his willingness to follow rules and regulations. Even after \nhis termination, he continued to use marijuana. He has not provided evidence of \nsuccessful rehabilitation. He did not provide an update as to his current marijuana \npossession, use, or abstinence. Insufficient time has passed to conclude future marijuana \npossession and use is unlikely. There is insufficient evidence to apply the above \nmitigating conditions.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H, E, and J in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines H, E, and J and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse, Guideline E, \npersonal conduct, and Guideline J, criminal conduct. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted, in part, and denied, in part, the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He admitted opening the checking accounts in question for an acquaintance; but denied fraudulent behavior, as the acquaintance and his former spouse were divorced; and as such, no information was hidden during a pending divorce. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is unmarried, and has no children. (TR at page 6 line 18 to page 7 line 4, and at page 26 line 13 to page 27 line 9.) Guideline E - Personal Conduct 1.a. Applicant has a \u201cside job\u201d as a tennis coach. He admits that in November of 2015, more than eight years ago when he was 26 years old, he was approached by the father of one his tennis students and asked for a personal favor. This father had just gone through a divorce; and as a result, was suffering some financial difficulties. He asked Applicant for a favor: to open a personal checking account and business checking account, on behalf of the father and the father\u2019s business, respectively, which Applicant did. The father gave monies to Applicant to deposit in the personal account to cover the father\u2019s monthly rent for a new apartment. Other than opening the business account, however, Applicant had little to do with its transactions. (TR at page 18 line 7 to page 26 line 9, at page 28 line 2 to page 53 line 20, GX 2 at page 8, an",

Driskill, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n01/31/2024 \nDecision \nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge: \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 18, 2023, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline E. (Personal Conduct). The \nSOR further informed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, \nDoD adjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 18, 2023, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on October 23, \n2023. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non October 23, 2023, scheduling the hearing for November 3, 2023. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled.

DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on \nNovember 15, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted, in part, and denied, in part, the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He \nadmitted opening the checking accounts in question for an acquaintance; but denied \nfraudulent behavior, as the acquaintance and his former spouse were divorced; and as \nsuch, no information was hidden during a pending divorce. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is unmarried, \nand has no children. (TR at page 6 line 18 to page 7 line 4, and at page 26 line 13 to \npage 27 line 9.) \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n1.a. Applicant has a \u201cside job\u201d as a tennis coach. He admits that in November of \n2015, more than eight years ago when he was 26 years old, he was approached by the \nfather of one his tennis students and asked for a personal favor. This father had just \ngone through a divorce; and as a result, was suffering some financial difficulties. He \nasked Applicant for a favor: to open a personal checking account and business \nchecking account, on behalf of the father and the father\u2019s business, respectively, which \nApplicant did. The father gave monies to Applicant to deposit in the personal account to \ncover the father\u2019s monthly rent for a new apartment. Other than opening the business \naccount, however, Applicant had little to do with its transactions. (TR at page 18 line 7 \nto page 26 line 9, at page 28 line 2 to page 53 line 20, GX 2 at page 8, and AppX A.) \nApplicant became suspicious of his conduct in continuing with these accounts, \nand sought out the advice of his own father, who testified at Applicant\u2019s hearing, and \nwho had pointed out the naivety of Applicant\u2019s actions. (TR at page 66 line 23 to page \n73 line 21.) In October of 2016, more than seven years ago, Applicant declined \ncontinuing the personal account, and ceased any association with the business \naccount. (TR at page 18 line 7 to page 26 line 9, and at page 28 line 2 to page 53 line \n20.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process.

According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nApplicant opened two checking accounts in his name on behalf of another, \nthereby circumventing the rules and regulations of the banking system. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise this disqualifying condition. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct ceased more than seven ago, when he took action to \ndiscontinue the checking accounts on behalf of another. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has a distinguished history in the \nworkplace (AppXs B~D), and is respected by his security manager and by two \nsupervisors (TR at page 75 to page 93 line 16). He performs well at his job. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Personal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nRichard A.

His parents are naturalized \nAmerican citizens, originally from Lebanon. He has one sibling, who is also a native-\nborn American citizen. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 18; Tr. 33-34.) \n1.a. The Government\u2019s first stated concern in the SOR is that \u201c[Applicant\u2019s] \nmother, a dual citizen of Lebanon and the United States, is the leader of [a local] \nchapter of the Lebanese Forces North America [LFNA], an American-based nonprofit \norganization that promotes the interests of the Lebanese Forces political party in the \nUnited States.\u201d  \nAs stated in the SOR, LFNA is an IRS \u00b6501(c)(3) non-profit charitable \norganization. Applicant\u2019s mother describes the conduct of her chapter of about 40 active \nmembers as follows in Applicant Enclosure 10: \nThe [local] chapter we help people from Lebanon who recently immigrated \n[from] Lebanon to [her city of residence] establish themselves in this \ncountry legally and comfortably (establish a home, school for their kids, \nfind a job, etc.). Day-to-day, the activities are mainly social activities, such \nas Christmas parties, restaurant gatherings, etc. My son gave a good \nanalogy of the \u201cYoung Democrats/Republicans\u201d college groups where like \nminded individuals gather in a social setting. The group is not very \ninvolved in the political process in Lebanon and have no impact in \nLebanon. The extent we are involved with Lebanese politics is only \nkeeping up with the news. (See Tr. 56, 65-72, 77-78, 80-84.) \nThe Internal Revenue Service describes the allowed \u201cexempt purposes\u201d of a \n\u00b6501(c)(3) organization as follows: \nThe exempt purposes set forth in section 501(c)(3) are charitable, \nreligious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering \nnational or international amateur sports competition, and preventing \ncruelty to children or animals. The term charitable is used in its generally \naccepted legal sense and includes relief of the poor, the distressed, or the \nunderprivileged; advancement of religion; advancement of education or \nscience; erecting or maintaining public buildings, monuments, or works; \nlessening the burdens of government; lessening neighborhood tensions; \neliminating prejudice and discrimination; defending human and civil rights \nsecured by law; and combating community deterioration and juvenile \ndelinquency.

I have no fondness or affection towards \nthe Lebanese Forces, any other Lebanese political party or group, or the \nLebanese government in general, and I have no preference for Lebanon \nover the United States. In fact, I have made it clear to my mother that I \nhave not, do not, and will never be involved in the organization, and that \nany interaction would purely be for either supporting her, or in a \nhumanitarian context. . . . Even at home, I refuse to speak of Lebanese \npolitics with my mother. \nHe has been to two social events while his mother has been president. His \nmother stated, \u201cOutside of that, he refuse [sic] to be involved at all with the Lebanese \nForces.\u201d (Applicant Enclosures 5 and 11; Tr. 70-71, 81.) \nApplicant\u2019s mother also stated the following, \u201cI\u2019m so proud to have an American \nPassport. I am so proud to have my kids, they have an American Passport, and I am so \nproud I\u2019m American.\u201d (Tr. 38-39, 72.) \nApplicant is very aware of his responsibilities if he obtains a security clearance. \nHe stated that he has not been approached by anyone about seeking classified \ninformation, nor has he or anyone he knows been threatened for such information. (Tr. \n33, 59.) \nApplicant expanded on his personal conduct regarding security responsibilities in \nApplicant Enclosure 5: \nI have established a precedent that I will not speak about work at home or \nwith my relatives. Even when working at [a prior employer], when asked \nabout my work, I was vague and avoided answering directly any \nquestions. I made it a point to speak about work only in a vague and \ninconspicuous way, even though no information was classified or \nrestricted beyond ITAR requirements. In my mind, I did this because I \nunderstand information may inadvertently slip out or propagate without the \npre-context of ill-willed intention. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n.\n.\n.\n. \n \n \n1.b. The Government\u2019s concern in this subparagraph was the presence of \nApplicant\u2019s grandmother in Lebanon. She passed away in October 2023, vitiating any \nsecurity concerns. This allegation is found for Applicant. (Tr. 25, 55.) \n1.c and 1.d. Applicant\u2019s uncle is a citizen of, and lives in, Lebanon. According to \nApplicant, the area where his uncle lives is \u201cfairly safe and fairly stable.\u201d This location is \nnot near the Syrian or Israeli borders. The uncle had a stroke several years ago and \nbecame disabled. For several years Applicant has been providing money towards his \nuncle\u2019s living expenses in Lebanon. He currently sends $750 a month to his uncle \nthrough his father. This information was disclosed on his e-QIP. The total he has sent \nover the past several years is approximately $25,000. This expense does not have an \nappreciable impact on Applicant\u2019s finances. He provided records showing that he is \nfinancially secure. He talks to this uncle every month or so. Applicant last visited \nLebanon in 2015. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 20A; Applicant Enclosures 5, 6, and \n11; Applicant Exhibits C, D, and E; Tr. 27-32, 44.)  \nLebanon \nI take administrative notice of the following facts concerning Lebanon:  \nLebanon is a parliamentary republic with close ties to the United States. Lebanon \nhas significant internal anti-western terrorism threats that operate contrary to U.S. \ninterests. The U.S. Department of State has a level 4 travel advisory in effect for \nLebanon since October 17, 2023, which advises against all travel to Lebanon. It \nspecifically states to avoid travel to the borders of Lebanon with Syria and Israel. There \nis potential for death or injury in Lebanon because of terrorist attacks. (Government \nExhibits 3 and 4.) \nAccording to the State Department \u201cCountry Reports on Terrorism 2021,\u201d the latest \nreport in the record (Government Exhibit 4 at Item 5): \nIn 2021, the United States provided security assistance and training to the \nLebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and worked with law enforcement \norganizations, such as the Internal Security Forces (ISF), to enhance their \ncounterterrorism capabilities and investigate and prosecute local terrorism \ncases. \nLebanon does not have a comprehensive terrorism law, but several articles \nof Lebanon\u2019s criminal code are effectively used to prosecute acts of terrorism. \n. . . The Department of State funded programs to train judges and \nprosecutors on the skills needed to adjudicate criminal cases, including \nterrorism-related cases. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLAF and ISF units, including units receiving U.S. capacity building \nassistance, undertook enforcement actions against suspected terrorists in \n2021. In January, the LAF arrested 18 Lebanese and Syrian nationals \nsuspected of being ISIS operatives in the northeaster Arsal region. \nMitigation \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor since July 2022 testified and provided a written statement. \nThe witness is knowledgeable about the allegations in the SOR. He finds that \nApplicant\u2019s performance \u201cis at a level of what you would expect from a new hire.\u201d The \nwitness gave Applicant a \u201cSPOT\u201d award for contributions to the employer. He has had \nno issues with Applicant and recommends him for a position of trust. (Applicant \nEnclosure 8; Applicant Exhibits A and B; Tr. 85-93.) \nApplicant Enclosure 9 consists of six additional letters of recommendation for \nApplicant. All of the letter writers have knowledge of the allegations in the SOR. (Tr. 62-\n63.) \nThe first letter is from an individual who is currently an outside director of the \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA). He has had positions of \nresponsibility with the U.S. Government from 1971 to 2016. He has known Applicant for \nover ten years. He states, \u201c[Applicant] is known for avoiding all contact and relationship \nwith the tangled web of issues relating to his parents, their activities and their \nhomeland.\u201d He concludes, \u201cI am convinced beyond a doubt that [Applicant] takes his \nnational security responsibility most seriously and would never disgrace his country \neither by action or association.\u201d \nLetters two through five of Applicant Enclosure 9 are from coworkers and \nsupervisors at Applicant\u2019s previous place of employment. He worked there from October \n2020 to June 2022. He is described as someone who has shown \u201cthe utmost \nprofessionalism.\u201d Another writer states, \u201cHe takes his national security obligations very \nseriously and deeply understands the standards of conduct required to work in support \nof the Government.\u201d \nThe sixth letter is from Applicant\u2019s pastor. He stated, \u201c[Applicant] is a person of \ngreat moral character: integrity, honesty, and diligence.\u201d \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to \nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks national security eligibility enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 - Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(c) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflicts of interest. \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a dual citizen of Lebanon and the United States. She is the \ncurrent president of her local branch of LFNA. His disabled uncle lives in Lebanon and \nApplicant helps provide him financial assistance. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese disqualifying conditions. \nLebanon has significant internal anti-western terrorism threats that operate \ncontrary to U.S. interests. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s substantial and close family \nconnections in that country have the potential to generate a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a). The \nmutually beneficial relations between the United States and Lebanese military and \nsecurity forces, as set forth in administrative notice documents, is also an aspect of this \ncase that must be considered. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has stated: \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign \ncountry is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. \nHowever, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the \npotential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, \n2001). \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nTurning first to the concerns about Applicant\u2019s mother and her activities with \nLFNA. Applicant has stated repeatedly and forcefully that he is an American, that he \nhas nothing to do with LFNA, and has no interest in Lebanese politics. He has done all \nhe can to resolve this issue, which is most unlikely to generate potential for conflicts of \ninterest or foreign exploitation in these circumstances. \nApplicant has minimal contact with his uncle in Lebanon. They speak on a \nmonthly basis. Applicant helps support this relative with basic living expenses due to his \ndisability, but the amount is not excessive and does not have a detrimental affect on his \nfinances. \nSeveral facts support the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), (c), and (f). First, \nApplicant has little personal contact with his uncle, speaking to him only occasionally \nand last seeing him in 2015. Second, Applicant has substantial connections to the \nUnited States, primarily through his employment, and the fact that his parents are long-\ntime naturalized American citizens living here. Third, Applicant testified at length about \nhis lack of interest in Lebanese politics, and his life-long preference for the United \nStates.  \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is knowledgeable about his security responsibilities and evinced a \ncredible intent to follow appropriate rules in reporting any attempts by foreign actors to \ninfluence him. Applicant, his parents, his witness, and the people who wrote letters on \nhis behalf, all state that he goes out of his way to not discuss his work. He is a young \nand extremely proud American citizen with a tremendous career ahead of him. \nApplicant has completely mitigated the security significance of his mother\u2019s outside \nactivities and the presence of his uncle in Lebanon. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(b), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but warrant additional comment. Applicant \nhas shown himself to be a talented and patriotic American citizen and member of the \ndefense industry. He can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nUnited States due to his sense of loyalty to the United States and absence of obligation \nor affinity towards Lebanon. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

(HE 2) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA CAS notified Applicant that it intended \nto deny or revoke his security clearance because it did not find that it is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for him. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines J and F \n1 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(financial considerations).

(HE 1B) On March 19, 2024, DOHA issued an amended notice, setting \nthe hearing for June 25, 2024. (HE 1A) Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled on \nJune 25, 2024, using the Microsoft Teams video teleconference system. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered nine exhibits, and Applicant \noffered 38 exhibits. (Tr. 12-15; GE 1-9; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE LL) All proffered \nexhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. (Tr. 13, 15; GE 1-9; AE A-AE LL) \nOn July 2, 2024, DOHA received a transcript of Applicant\u2019s security clearance hearing. \nDepartment Counsel moved to withdraw the allegation under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations), SOR \u00b6 2, Applicant did not object, and I granted the motion. (Tr. 10) \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy.

(HE 3) He also provided \nmitigating information. (Id.) \nApplicant is a 24-year-old technician, and he has worked for a government \ncontractor at a location outside the United States for two years. (Tr. 16-17) He is not \nmarried, and he does not have any children. (Tr. 17) He served for three years in a military \nbranch of service, and he received an Other Than Honorable discharge. (Tr. 17) He \nreceived a Commendation Medal and a Certificate of Commendation during his military \nservice. (Tr. 51; AE B at 7; AE W) He has applied for an upgrade for his discharge. (Tr. \n17) He completed numerous training courses and received a diploma and certificates. \n(AE O, AE S-W) His resume provides additional information about his professional \nbackground and accomplishments. (AE B)   \nCriminal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges in August 2020, Applicant was arrested and charged with \nmalicious wounding in a state court. (Tr. 18) In about August 2023, Applicant pleaded \nguilty to unlawful wounding. He was sentenced to five years of incarceration (4 years and \n11 months suspended), a $2,500 fine, and to attend anger management counseling \nclasses. Applicant admitted the charges, pleas, and sentence, and he said he completed \nall sentencing requirements. (Tr. 22, 32; HE 3; GE 4) He provided an August 17, 2023 \ncertificate of completion for a 16-hour anger management course.

This is when I grabbed it out of her hand, got up \nand started swinging towards her to get her away from me. I believe the \nblade hit her arm at least once while swinging. (GE 1 at 42) \nIn his SOR response, Applicant said Ms. C came to his hotel room uninvited. (HE \n3) While they were together in the hotel room, the following altercation occurred: \n \nAfter hours of her abuse, [Ms. C] yanked a blanket off of me, removed the \nknife from the drawer, and stated she would kill herself, a threat she had \nmade before using a kitchen knife. She then lowered the knife from her \nthroat and advanced toward me after making a verbal threat to kill me. I \nstruggled with her to attempt to protect myself. At some point in the struggle, \nshe was struck by the blade while she was holding the knife. I called the \npolice. She attempted to flee the scene but was intercepted by the police \nresponding to my 911 call. I cooperated with the police and surrendered \npeacefully.  \nI acknowledge the seriousness of what occurred, and I agreed to the plea \ndeal offered by the prosecution. I did this in an effort to save my career and \nto try to save the relationship. I self-reported this incident to the chain of \ncommand. (HE 3, \u00b6 1a; see Tr. 20-22, 31, 33 (Applicant said he did not \nrecall how she was stabbed); GE 4) \nApplicant told the police that he stabbed Ms. C. (Tr. 34; GE 6 at 6) Ms. C was \ntreated at a hospital. (GE 6) Applicant was released on bond after his arrest, and one \ncondition was that he have no contact with Ms. C. (Tr. 35) Applicant said she initiated \ncontact with him, and the altercation alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b occurred. (Tr. 35-36) Applicant \nreceived five years of unsupervised probation, and he will be on probation until August of \n2028. (Tr. 33; GE 4) However, Applicant believes his probation will be completed when \nhe completes a course, which he is unable to complete because he is overseas. (Tr. 52) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c allege in about October 2020, Applicant was arrested and \ncharged with attempted strangle of another (Ms. C) causing wounding or injury. The \ncharge was dismissed in about December 2020 in exchange for his agreement to plead \nguilty to assault and battery in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court. He received \ndeferred disposition for 24 months. He was sentenced to supervised probation and \nprohibited from assaulting or harassing Ms. C. Applicant admitted the charges, pleas, and \nsentence. (Tr. 38; HE 3) He did not remember whether his plea agreement restricted his \naccess to weapons or prohibited him from contacting Ms. C. (Tr. 39) \nIn his April 11, 2022 SCA Applicant said Ms. C was about to break his laptop \ncomputer. Applicant said, \u201cI wrapped my arms around her to get her to stop.

(Tr. 23) He said he told Ms. C that the relationship was \nover, and he wanted her to leave his residence. (HE 3) He said, \u201cShe gathered her \nbelongings and while doing so, attempted to destroy property that belonged to me. I \nattempted to stop her using a bear hug, and she slipped free, ending in a position where \nI had my arms around her neck briefly.\u201d (HE 3; see Tr. 22-23) The police report indicates \nhe put her into a chokehold. (Tr. 36; GE 7) He denied that he choked her sufficiently to \ncause a bruise on her neck. (Tr. 37) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges in about December 2020, Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith assault and battery against a family or household member and with pointing, holding, \nor brandishing a firearm. He pleaded guilty to pointing, holding, or brandishing a firearm. \nHe was sentenced to 180 days of incarceration (176 days suspended) and 12 months of \nsupervised probation. Applicant admitted the charges, pleas, and sentence. (Tr. 23-24; \nHE 3) Applicant said he \u201cloaded a rifle he owned and ordered [Ms. C] to leave his home.\u201d \n(Id.) She videotaped Appellant\u2019s conduct and used it to coerce him into continuing their \nrelationship. (Id.) He continued the relationship; however, he eventually informed the \npolice of the \u201cblackmail video.\u201d (Id.) \nIn his April 11, 2022 SCA Applicant said: \nAfter refusing [to leave his apartment] for several hours and my patience \ngrowing thin, I picked up my rifle, loaded it, and removed her from the \napartment with verbal threats and a show of force. . . . While this was \noccurring, she was recording from her smart phone. (GE 1 at 40) \nAt his hearing, Applicant said he did not remember loading the firearm in front of \nMs. C. (Tr. 39-40) He did not remember threatening to kill Ms. C while pointing the firearm \nin her direction. (Tr. 40) On the video Applicant said he would shoot her in the head, and \nit is going to make her bleed out. (Tr. 40; GE 8 at 5) He said he did not remember telling \nthe police about the video. (Tr. 41-42) Alcohol and illegal drugs were not involved in the \naltercation with Ms. C. (Tr. 42) \nApplicant said Ms. C was a toxic relationship for him. (Tr. 27) He could not \nremember when he first dated her. (Tr. 27) He could not estimate how long the \nrelationship lasted. (Tr. 28) He denied that he lived with her. (Tr. 27) He attempted to \nbreak up with Ms. C several times; however, they subsequently resumed their \nrelationship. (Tr. 29) Ms. C keyed Applicant\u2019s car, and she called him about 200 times in \na day. (Tr. 20) He filed or attempted to file several restraining orders against Ms. C. (Tr. \n30-31) He said he did not remember whether he was still in a relationship with Ms. C in \nJuly 2021. (Tr. 44) He provided a statement from her dated March of 2024, and he said \nhe arranged for one of his friends to contact her. (Tr. 44) Applicant said he has not had \nany contact with Ms. C since December 2020. (Tr. 24) Later, he said his most recent \ncontact was in June 2022 before he went overseas.

He is not eligible for reenlistment. (Tr. 42-43; HE 3) He has \nrequested an upgrade of his discharge from the Discharge Review Board. (Tr. 26) \nMs. C\u2019s March 12, 2024 statement indicates she suffers from \u201cdeep-seated \ninsecurities and mental health issues including anxiety and a pervasive fear of \nabandonment.\u201d (AE BB) She said, \u201cmy irrational action in wielding a knife not only \nendangered both of us but also set off a regrettable chain of events. My actions in this \ninstance were unjustifiable and stemmed from my untreated mental health issues.\u201d (Id.) \nAs to the instance when Applicant put her in a choke hold, Ms. C said, \u201cI was not \nbeing strangled with harmful intent. I was simply being restrained and prevented from \ncausing more damage than I already had. While [Applicant\u2019s] response was not \nappropriate, it was a reaction to the immediate circumstances I had created, including \ndamaging his property.\u201d (Id.) For his threat with a firearm, she said, \u201cHis demeanor, \nalthough involving a firearm, was not intended to harm, but to address the deadlock \nsituation created by my actions and can be seen as very calm and collect[ed] although \nthe threatening words were used to get me to vacate the premises.\u201d (Id.) She is receiving \ntreatment for Borderline Personality Disorder, Anxiety, Depression, and potential Post \nTraumatic Stress Disorder. (Id.) \nApplicant also provided a background report from an Internet investigative \ncompany concerning Ms. C. (AE CC) Ms. C\u2019s background report indicates she has reports \nof misdemeanor larceny in 2018, misdemeanor stalking and simple assault in February \n2023, a domestic violence protective order in April 2023, and several traffic infractions. \n(AE CC) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant donates funds to several charities. (Tr. 26; AE EE) On July 26, 2021, Ms. \nC provided a statement recommending Applicant receive a General discharge from the \nMarine Corps, and she said that they were \u201cboth at fault\u201d in the problems in their \nrelationship. (Tr. 19; AE D) She described him as diligent, dedicated, and honest. (AE D) \nHe has learned from his mistakes and will not repeat them in the future. (AE D) \nOn November 5, 2023, Applicant\u2019s current girlfriend wrote that Applicant is a \nprofessional. (AE C) He is honorable, dedicated, and committed to national security. (AE \nC) She recommended approval of his security clearance. \n \nApplicant provided 14 character statements from coworkers and friends. (AE E-L, \nAA, GG-KK) The general sense of Applicant\u2019s character evidence is that he is \nprofessional, diligent, responsible, intelligent, honest, and respectful.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable, and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \u201cThe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of \nthe Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.

Discussion of the disqualifying \nconditions is in the mitigating section infra. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe record contains police reports regarding the altercations between Applicant \nand Ms. C. In ISCR Case No. 22-02391 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, 2023) The Appeal Board \nsaid: \nPolice reports, which are admissible both as an official record under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.20 and as a public record under Federal Rule of Evidence \n803(8), are presumed to be reliable by virtue of the government agency\u2019s \nduty for accuracy and the high probability that it has satisfied that duty. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02859 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 23, 2017); ISCR Case \nNo. 16-03603 at 4 (App. Bd. May 29, 2019). \nIn August 2020, Applicant stabbed Ms. C in her arm with a knife during an \naltercation. In about August 2023, he pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding. He was \nsentenced to five years of incarceration (4 years and 11 months suspended), a $2,500 \nfine, and to attend anger management counseling classes. He completed all sentencing \nrequirements. He is scheduled to be on probation until August 2028, and he is currently \non probation. He may be able to end probation before August 2028. \nIn about October 2020, Ms. C was about to damage Applicant\u2019s computer, and he \ndescribed the subsequent altercation as follows: \u201cI wrapped my arms around her to get \nher to stop. She proceeded to fight me, and she slipped from my bear hug that I \nperformed. She then ended up with my arms around her neck in a choke hold briefly \nbefore she freed herself.\u201d (GE 1 at 44)  \nIn about December 2020, Applicant loaded his rifle and pointed it at Ms. C. During \nthe altercation, Ms. C was videotaping his behavior. On the video Applicant said he would \nshoot her in the head, and it is going to make her bleed out. \nApplicant received an Other Than Honorable discharge. He has requested an \nupgrade in his discharge. His most recent criminal offense was in December 2020 and \ninvolved Ms. C. He is no longer involved with Ms. C. Applicant has an excellent \nemployment record as indicated by his character statements. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are \npartially established. \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive. Applicant made inconsistent \nstatements. For example, in his SCA he said he stabbed Ms. C in the arm after taking \nthe knife away from her. In his SOR response, he said, \u201cAt some point in the struggle, \nshe was struck by the blade while she was holding the knife.\u201d At his personal appearance, \nhe said he did not recall how she was stabbed. His statements at his hearing about not \nremembering events relating to the altercations and relationship with Ms. C damaged his \ncredibility and reflect poorly on his rehabilitation. His three crimes are serious and too \nrecent to be fully mitigated. Criminal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. A careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the whole-person \nconcept is required, including the totality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations. \nEach case is decided on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant \ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline J are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 24-year-old technician, and he has worked for a government \ncontractor at a location outside the United States for two years. He served for three years \nin a military branch of service, and he received an Other Than Honorable discharge. He \nhas applied for an upgrade for his discharge. He received a Commendation Medal and a \nCertificate of Commendation from the military service. He completed numerous training \ncourses and received a diploma and certificates. \nApplicant donates funds to several charities. On July 26, 2021, Ms. C said that \nthey were \u201cboth at fault\u201d in the problems in their relationship. Applicant provided 16 \ncharacter statements from coworkers, friends, Ms. C, and his current girlfriend. The \ngeneral sense of Applicant\u2019s character evidence is that he is professional, diligent, \nresponsible, intelligent, honest, and respectful. He demonstrates excellent leadership and \ncontributes to mission accomplishment. The character evidence supports his continued \naccess to classified information. \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive. In 2020, Applicant committed \nthree assaults and batteries on Ms. C. One assault involved him stabbing her with a knife, \nin another he choked her, and in the third incident, he threatened to kill her and pointed \na loaded rifle toward her. These are serious crimes. Applicant is currently on probation. \nHe was not honest and candid at his hearing when he claimed a lack of memory of details \nabout his relationship with Ms. C and specifics of the assaults. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec.

On September 20, 2023, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudication Services issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the Department of \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDefense on June 8, 2017.

The case was \nassigned to me on December 5, 2023. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on February 12, 2024. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled via TEAMS on March 11, 2024. The Government offered Government Exhibits \n1 through 7, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, \ncalled one additional witness, and submitted Applicant Exhibits A through Z. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 22, 2024. Applicant requested the \nrecord remain open for receipt of additional information. Applicant submitted Applicant \nExhibits aa through ll in a timely fashion, and they were also admitted without objection. \nThe record then closed. \nRulings on Procedure \nBased on the evidence presented at the hearing Department Counsel made a \nmotion to amend the SOR in accordance with Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, \n\u00b6 E3.1.17.

He and his wife have been \nseparated at various times since 2004. They have reconciled, but still live apart. He has \nan associate degree and has been employed by a defense contractor since 2016 as a \nProgram Planner. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18; Tr. 49-50, 82-\n83, 102-104.)  \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has failed to meet his financial obligations and is therefore potentially \nunreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant admitted allegations 1.a through 1.d in the SOR with explanations. As stated, \nallegation 1.e has been withdrawn. He denied allegations 1.f through 1.k with \nexplanations. He also submitted additional information to support the granting of national \nsecurity eligibility. \n \n1.a and 1.b. These allegations concern Applicant\u2019s failure to file nine years of \nFederal and State A tax returns in a timely fashion.

One of the \nreasons was the fact that he and his wife were separated since 2004 and contemplated \ndivorce in 2010. They have since reconciled, though they still live apart. He also had a \nseries of medical issues that required various surgeries, which cost him money, a job, \nand time. There were also other financial issues that he felt impacted his ability to resolve \nhis tax situation. Furthermore, he had to help his children financially. He also admitted \nthat as time passed, he got scared and simply kept pushing his tax returns onto the back \nburner. (Tr. 50-59, 71, 84-88, 94-98.) \nApplicant stated that he had begun trying to resolve his tax situation in 2023 before \nhe received the SOR. Once he received the SOR he realized that he needed help to \nresolve the issue. He obtained the services of a tax attorney, who has been working with \nApplicant to resolve these tax issues. The attorney testified about his representation of \nApplicant, including his contact with the Federal and State A tax authorities, and his filing \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent tax returns. (Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 23-46, 109-111.) \nWith regard to his Federal tax returns, Applicant submitted documentation from the \nIRS confirming that all of the subject tax returns have now been filed. The last returns to \nbe filed were those from 2011 and 2012. They were filed on March 11, 2024, the same \nday as Applicant\u2019s hearing. His 2023 Federal income tax return was filed in a timely \nfashion. He stated that he will file his future tax returns in a timely fashion.

He has taken a credit \ncounseling class. He also has a budget. (Applicant Exhibits F, H, I, J, K, L, M, V, W, aa, \nbb, and cc; Tr. 68-72.) \nApplicant also submitted letters of recommendation from work associates, \nincluding a program manager. He is described as a person of integrity who is dependable, \ntrustworthy, and reliable. The writers recommend him for a position of trust. (Applicant \nExhibits B, C, D, and E.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file Federal and State A income tax returns, as required, \nfor tax years 2011, 2012, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. He also owes \na considerable amount of money in delinquent taxes to the Federal Government and \nState A. He only recently filed the subject tax returns and begun making payments when \nconfronted with losing his security clearance eligibility. He also had past-due debts to \nseveral creditors. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying \nconditions and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes several conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nTurning first to Applicant\u2019s past-due consumer debts found in allegations 1.f \nthrough 1.k. He has paid all of these consumer debts, albeit after issuance of the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies to these debts, but its overall weight is lessened by the lateness and \nmotivational circumstances of his conduct. \nRegarding his taxes, Applicant failed to abide by Federal and state tax laws by not \nfiling his Federal and state tax returns for nine tax years between 2011 and 2022. His \nfailure to act in a timely manner shows a defect in responsibility and trustworthiness. \nCircumstances beyond his control may have distracted him from filing his annual income \ntax returns. They have been considered. Applicant did not file for an extension to \naccommodate his circumstances, nor did he contact anyone to help him file his returns \non time until he was faced with this proceeding. Instead, he ignored the situation until it \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nbecame an imminent threat to his employment. He has not acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. There is no justification for his failure to file his income tax returns on time. \nHe has failed to mitigate this violation of tax laws. This misconduct further demonstrates \na lack of judgment and reliability. \nAs long as Applicant is gainfully employed and earning sufficient monies, he is \nrequired to file annual income tax returns on time. Voluntary compliance with rules and \nregulations is essential for protecting classified information. If he cannot follow the tax \nlaws, he very well may not be able or willing to follow the rules required to protect \nclassified information. It was only when his tax delinquencies were an impediment to his \nsecurity clearance eligibility that he took action to get his income tax returns filed and \nestablished payment plans with the Federal and State A tax authorities. Those plans have \nbarely begun. There is virtually no track record of him fulfilling his tax responsibilities in a \ntimely and consistent fashion. His actions do not amount to a good-faith effort at this time. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply to his tax situation. Guideline F is found against \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not provided \nsufficient evidence to show that he has resolved his tax issues, and that they will not recur \nin the future. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress has not been resolved at \nthe present time. Overall, the evidence does create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, eligibility, and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant has not met his \nburden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for financial \nconsiderations. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.f through 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

The SOR alleges the following \ndebts: Applicant failed to file his Federal Income tax return for tax year 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: \nGE 1 at 83); a $9,112 debt owed to the DPT Treasury that was placed for collection (SOR \n\u00b6 1.b: GE 5 at 3; GE 6 at 2); a debt owed to the DPT Treasury in the amount of $8,968 \nthat was placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.c: GE 6 at 2; GE 7 at 3); a $1,939 debt owed to \nDLRFIRM for an account that was placed for collection by a German utility company (SOR \n\u00b6 1.d: GE 5 at 3; GE 6 at 2); a $469 debt owed to the DPT Treasury that was placed for \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncollection (SOR \u00b6 1.e: GE 6 at 3; GE 7 at 4); and a debt owed to the DPT Treasury in the \namount of $48 that was placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.e: GE 5 at 4; GE 6 at 3). \nApplicant testified that he had 18 years of combined active-duty service in the U.S. \nArmy and the U.S. Air Force. He worked as a civilian employee with the Department of \nDefense for 11 years. He states that he has had no security issues for over 20 years. He \nclaims that his credit report does not affect him because he lives overseas. He admits \nthat he needs to take care of a few small bills but does not believe it can be held against \nhim. He is currently living on his disability pay from the U.S. Department of Veteran\u2019s \nAffairs (VA). In June 2024, the VA awarded him a 100 percent disability rating. He \nreceives a $3,946 a month from the VA. (Tr. 18-20; AE C at 3-5, 14-16) \nApplicant lives overseas with his wife and his adult daughter who has special \nneeds. His wife is a German citizen. In the area where they live, the better paying jobs \nare contracting jobs with the Department of Defense. These jobs require a security \nclearance. If he gets his security clearance, he will be able to work for a defense \ncontractor. He will then be able to use his VA disability payments to resolve his delinquent \ndebts. His VA disability allows him to pay the family household expenses, but he does not \nreceive enough to resolve additional debts. (Tr. 20-21, 24) \nApplicant\u2019s most recent job was with a DOD contractor since August 2020. As a \ndefense contractor he falls under the German Employment System as a German \nemployee. Applicant says that his employer made a mistake during the security process. \nAs a result, he was let go because he did not have an active security clearance. However, \nin Germany, you just cannot fire someone. The employer is required to go to court to \ndetermine if the firing was legal. In Applicant\u2019s case, the German court required his \nemployer to continue to sponsor Applicant until the outcome of the security clearance \nprocess. (Tr. 25-28; GE 4 at 3-10) \nWhen he completed his security clearance application (e-QIP) on August 4, 2021, \nApplicant listed that he failed to file his federal income tax returns for tax year 2018 under \nSection 26 \u2013 Financial Record \u2013 Taxes. He wrote: \nI did  not realize this mistake until I was filling out this information. Our family \nwent through a huge change in 2019, and dealt with several health and \nemployment issues, I didn\u2019t realize that I had not filed last year. I will file \n2018 when I file 2019 this year. This was an oversight on my part due to \nextenuating circumstances.  (GE 1 at 83)  \nDuring his background investigation interview on September 1, 2021, Applicant \nstated he intended to file his 2018 federal income tax return but he is missing his W-2 for \n2018 and his attempts to obtain a copy of his W-2 form for 2018 have been unsuccessful \nas a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. It has been difficult for him to contact the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS). (GE 2 at 2-3) \nIn response to Interrogatories, dated March 2, 2023, Applicant indicated he had \nnot filed his 2018 federal income tax returns because he was unable to obtain a copy of \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis W-2.

(GE 3) \nOn December 10, 2023, Applicant completed another Interrogatory regarding the \nfiling status of his federal income tax returns for tax years 2017 \u2013 2022. He indicated that \nhe filed all of his federal income tax returns with the exception of tax year 2018 and tax \nyear 2022. (GE 4 at 2) (Note: His federal income tax return for tax year 2022 has been \nfiled and is not an issue in this case.) \nThe current status of the SOR allegations are: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: failure to file Federal income tax returns for tax year 2018. Applicant \nadmits this allegation. In 2018, Applicant\u2019s status changed from being a civilian employee \nfor the U.S. government to being a contractor for DOD whose status was as an employee \nin the German Employment System. He left the federal service in October 2018 because \nhis status as a civilian employee in Germany could not be extended. He was required to \nfile federal income taxes for tax year 2018. Applicant claims he could not file his 2018 \nfederal income tax returns because he no longer had access to the on-line portal where \nhe could access his W-2. He attempted to have the DOD send him his W-2 but was \nunsuccessful. He really did not know where to obtain a W-2. Eventually, he stopped \nattempting to locate his W-2 until the issue showed up with his security clearance process. \nHe began attempting to contact OPM to get a copy of his W-2, which was not the correct \nagency to inquire about obtaining a copy of this W-2. He did not contact the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) about obtaining a copy of his W-2. He did not know who to contact. \n(Tr. 28-32) \nIn October 2023, a Department Counsel from DOHA contacted Applicant about \nscheduling his hearing. The Department Counsel advised him to submit a Form 4506-T \nwith IRS. He submitted this FORM in October 2023. He contacted the IRS several times, \nbut never received a response. At the close of the hearing, he was still awaiting a \nresponse from the IRS. (Tr. 36-37; AE A) \nAfter the hearing, Applicant finally heard from the IRS. They provided him a copy \nof his W-2 form. Applicant completed his federal income tax return for tax year 2018 and \nindicated he intended to forward it to the IRS. The 1040 form lists Applicant\u2019s income as \n$48,852 and that he was owed a refund in the amount of $2,792. He indicated in his post-\nhearing response, dated June 18, 2024, that he intended to mail the 2018 federal income \ntax return to the IRS within a week. He provided no proof that he had mailed the return. \n(AE D at 2, 44-45) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f: DPT TREASURY debts placed for collection in the \nrespective amounts of $9,112; $8,968; $469, and $48. In response to DOHA \nInterrogatories, dated March 2, 2023, Applicant denied these debts because there was \nnot enough information for him to know what these debts were. He initially thought they \nmay be related to student loans. After the hearing, Applicant obtained a copy of his recent \ncredit report with Transunion dated June 11, 2024.

Despite his \nfeelings, he learned that he could set up an account with pay.gov and will start making \npayments towards these debts using this portal. At the close of the record, he had not \nprovided proof that he started making payments towards these debts. He claims the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.f are the same debt. They have the same account number. \nI find for Applicant with regard to SOR \u00b6 1.f.

(AE D at 2-30) \nDebt Not Alleged in SOR \nDuring the hearing, Applicant discussed the issues he was having with his student \nloans. He initially thought his student loan accounts were the debts the DPT Treasury \nwas collecting. He attended a college who the Department of Education ultimately forgave \nthe students their student loans because of the school\u2019s fraudulent practices. He said the \nschool enrolled him for a semester without his knowledge. (Tr. 38) After the hearing, he \nprovided a statement from Nelnet, dated July 12, 2024. indicating that the Department of \nEducation approved the discharge of his student loans based on his Total and Permanent \nDisability. (AE E) There is no evidence in the file that his student loans were delinquent. \nNone of his student loans were alleged in the SOR. This information is considered under \nextenuation and mitigation. \nWhole Person Factors \nApplicant provided copies of his DD 214s which showed his honorable service with \nthe Air National Guard (ANG), Army, and Air Force. He provided copies of his Air Force \nperformance evaluations which were favorable.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following applies in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts:  \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations: and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(b) apply because Applicant incurred five debts, an \napproximate total balance of $20,000. AG \u00b6 19(f) applies because Applicant failed to \ntimely file his federal income tax return for tax year 2018. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial issues are ongoing and \nremained unresolved at the close of the record. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because it \nappears Applicant incurred close to $20,000 in medical bills. The mitigating condition is \ngiven less weight because Applicant did not behave responsibly under the circumstances. \nHe ignored his medical bills for years resulting in the debts being placed for collection \nthrough the DPT Treasury. After the hearing, he mentioned that he intended to start \nmaking payments towards these debts but had not entered into a repayment agreement. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply because Applicant ignored his delinquent debts for \nyears. He felt that his credit report would not adversely affect him because he lived \noverseas. While Applicant initially had a point about not being able to identify the original \ncreditors of the debt which was being collected by the DPT TREASURY as alleged in the \nSOR, he was able to track down the original creditor by obtaining a more recent copy of \nhis credit report after the hearing. He does not deny that he incurred these medical debts. \nHe felt he should not have to pay them because he believed insurance should cover all \nof the medical debts. In his post-hearing submissions, he mentioned he intends to start \nrepaying these debts to the DPT TREASURY using the website pay.gov. He had not \nstarted making payments. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) partially applies. Applicant finally received a copy of his W-2 for 2018 \nin June 2024. Applicant prepared his federal income tax return for tax year 2018. \nHowever, he had not provided proof that he sent it the IRS at the close of the record. \nWhile there was some confusion on Applicant\u2019s part on how to get his W-2, he should \nhave been more diligent in resolving this problem. With regard to timely filing tax returns, \nthe DOHA Appeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s 18 years of honorable military service, his 11 years service \nas a DOD civilian employee, and his years as a DOD contractor. More concerning, are \nhis lack of due diligence in ensuring his 2018 federal income tax return was filed in a \ntimely manner and his deliberate failure to repay his medical debt. While he began to \ntake steps after the hearing to resolve these issues, there is not a sufficient track record \nto show that he will make payments to the DPT TREASURY on a regular and consistent \nbasis. A promise to pay in the future, is not sufficient to mitigate security concerns raised \nby Applicant\u2019s failure to timely pay or resolve his delinquent accounts, especially if the \ndebts were ignored over a period of years. While Applicant is close to filing his 2018 \nfederal income tax return, he provided no proof that the return was mailed to the IRS. \nThe security concerns raised under Financial Considerations are not mitigated. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c, 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d, 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant responded to the SOR on March 2, 2024 (Answer) and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nSeptember 3, 2024. \nAfter conferring with the parties, I scheduled the matter for hearing on November \n20, 2024. The hearing was convened as scheduled. I admitted Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 9 and Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through E in evidence without objection. \nAt Applicant\u2019s request, I left the record open until December 11, 2024, for the \nsubmission of post-hearing documents.

In about January 2020, you were charged with DWI and DWI BAC of \n>=.15% in [City, State] after registering a BAC of .157.

He went out drinking with friends after work. He had \nplanned to stay that night with a friend closer to where he worked. However, after \ndrinking to intoxication, he decided that he would make the one-hour drive back to his \nhome. On his way home, he crashed his car into a guardrail and totaled his car.

He had been \ncelebrating his birthday at bars with friends, where he had a combination of about six \nbeers and four shots of liquor between about 9:00 p.m. and about 12:30 a.m. the \nfollowing morning. He claimed he did not feel intoxicated, so he left the bar to drive \nhome at about 2:00 a.m. A police officer pulled him over for making an illegal right turn \nat a red light. After admitting to responding police officers that he had been drinking, he \nfailed a field sobriety test. He refused a police request for a voluntary blood draw, but \npolice obtained a subpoena and performed the blood draw, the result of which was a \n.111 percent BAC.

After work that day, he \nparticipated in his bowling league and then went out for dinner and drinks with one of \nhis friends. He drank until about 2:00 a.m., then he drove home. While he drove home, \nhe realized he should not be driving because of how intoxicated he was, and pulled his \ncar over to the shoulder of the road so that he could call a friend to pick him up and \ndrive him home. However, before he could contact this friend, a police officer pulled up \non the shoulder of the road behind his car. The police officer asked him if he had been \ndrinking and gave him a field sobriety test after Applicant acknowledged that he had. \nApplicant failed the field sobriety test, police arrested him for DWI, and he spent another \nnight in jail. (Tr. 33-37, 50-54, 68; Answer; GE 1-4, 7-9) \nIn October 2020, the court ruled on all three of Applicant\u2019s DWIs. For the March \n2019 DWI, he pleaded nolo contendere. The court ordered that he complete 80 hours of \ncommunity service, sentenced him to 360 days confinement (all suspended), and \nassessed him fees and costs totaling $307. For the June 2019 DWI, he pleaded nolo \ncontendere. The court ordered that he complete 80 hours of community service, \nsentenced him to 180 days confinement (all suspended), and assessed him fees and \ncosts totaling $907. For the January 2020 DWI, he pleaded guilty. The court ordered \nthat he serve 120 days in prison (all suspended), placed him on community supervision \nfor 12 months, and assessed him fees and costs. He was also not permitted to \nconsume alcohol for 22 months. He complied with all the court\u2019s orders related to these \nsentences. (Tr. 33-37, 41-57, 69; Answer; GE 1-4, 7-9; AE D, E) \nApplicant attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings twice weekly from the \nend of February 2020 until February or March 2022. He stopped attending meetings \nafter the meeting location changed. He did not know or seek out the new location. In \nMarch 2020 and from May 2020 until August 2020 (interruption because of the COVID-\n19 pandemic), he utilized a program provided by his employer to undergo mental-health \nand alcohol-related counseling. His counselor, a licensed professional counselor (LPC), \nlisted his presenting problem as alcohol abuse and wrote that his signs and symptoms \nwere consistent with alcohol abuse. Applicant claimed he stopped this program because \nthe LPC missed an appointment. The LPC noted that Applicant was coping well and did \nnot require further psychological evaluation. (Tr. 70-79, 84-89; GE 5, 7, 9; AE C)   \nOn March 10, 2023, at DOD\u2019s request, Applicant underwent an assessment by a \nlicensed psychologist (Psychologist A). Psychologist A issued a report based upon that \nassessment dated March 23, 2023. As part of the assessment, Psychologist A \ninterviewed him and had him complete a standardized psychology inventory called the \nPersonality Assessment Inventory (PAI). In his report, Psychologist A noted that \nApplicant had one significant elevation on the Alcohol Problems scale, but that \u201cthis \nelevation is to be expected and is in a range that is consistent for one who has a history \nof personal, legal, physical or occupational consequences secondary to problematic use \nof alcohol.\u201d (GE 7) \nPsychologist A opined that Applicant no longer meets the diagnostic criteria for \nalcohol use disorder.

However, there is no evidence in the record to support this \nstatement. The LPC\u2019s records that are in evidence show that Applicant presented with \n\u201calcohol abuse.\u201d (GE 7; AE C) \nPsychologist A\u2019s prognosis for Applicant was guarded, because \u201cit may be \npremature to say that sufficient time has passed since he has resumed drinking to be \nconfident that similar adverse effects are unlikely to recur.\u201d He noted that Applicant \nbegan drinking again when his probation ended and that his restlessness and \nimpulsivity could contribute to his poor judgment when drinking. He also wrote that \nApplicant was beginning to consume alcohol again under the same circumstances that \nled to his binge drinking in the past. He recommended that Applicant pair his modified \ndrinking with professional treatment and guidance. (GE 7)  \nApplicant testified that, in April 2024, he learned that Psychologist A suggested \nthat he obtain additional alcohol counseling. He sought and received alcohol-related \nand mental health treatment from another psychologist (Psychologist B) for \napproximately 10 sessions from about April 2024 to July 2024. He testified that he \nstopped receiving treatment from Psychologist B because Psychologist B told him that \nhe did not require further treatment unless Applicant thought he needed it. A December \n9, 2024 letter from Psychologist B confirmed his treatment dates, stated that he \ncomplied with all expectations requested of him, and that Applicant has reported no \nsignificant concerns regarding his alcohol usage. Psychologist B wrote that Applicant \ntold him that he would reach out to Psychologist B for support if he felt \u201cat risk.\u201d \nApplicant had one phone call with Psychologist B because of anxiety after his July 2024 \ntreatment ended. (Tr. 80-84; GE 7; AE F) \nApplicant stayed sober from the day of his January 2020 arrest until August \n2022. In August 2022, he decided to begin consuming alcohol again because he missed \nthe social aspect of it. The first day he drank, he had three to five drinks at home with \nfriends to test how much he could drink and stay in control. After that, he has consumed \nno more than two drinks in a social setting every couple of months. Throughout 2023 \nuntil about five months ago, he occasionally drank part of an alcoholic beverage before \ndriving, but since then, has not consumed any alcohol before he drives. Part of the \nreason he felt comfortable drinking even part of a drink before driving is that he had an \nignition interlock device on his car that he would use to determine if he had too much to \ndrink before driving. When he no longer had the ignition interlock device on his vehicle, \nhe did not feel comfortable having anything to drink before driving, so, in about April \n2024, he stopped consuming even part of a drink before driving.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was charged with DWI three times between March 2019 and January \n2020. He pleaded nolo contendere to the first two charges and pleaded guilty to the last. \nHe acknowledged that he was impaired while driving on two of these occasions after \nbinge drinking. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) are established. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(d), 22(e), and 22(f) are not established. There is insufficient evidence \nthat Applicant was diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder and therefore no evidence \nthat he did not follow treatment advice after such a diagnosis. While Psychologist A \nwrote that the LPC stated that Applicant presented to the LPC with an alcohol use \ndisorder, the LPC\u2019s records in evidence show that the LPC found he presented with \nalcohol abuse. Furthermore, Psychologist A found that Applicant did not meet the \ncriteria for an alcohol use disorder diagnosis. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations.  \nIt has been almost five years since Applicant had an alcohol-related legal \nincident. He has not been intoxicated since about August 2022, when he intentionally \nbecame so in what he considered a controlled environment. I find that sufficient time \nhas passed without recurrence of legal problems or binge drinking to show both those \nbehaviors are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 23(a) applies. \nApplicant acknowledged that he needed to change his relationship with alcohol. \nHe attended AA meetings and sought alcohol-related treatment from a work-sponsored \nprofessional counselor. When he learned Psychologist A recommended that he \ncontinue to receive alcohol-related treatment in conjunction with his plan of modified \nconsumption, he sought and received treatment from Psychologist B. He has modified \nhis alcohol consumption, and now consumes no more than two drinks about twice per \nmonth. \nPsychologist A\u2019s March 2023 \u201cguarded\u201d prognosis (along with a finding that \nApplicant did not have an alcohol use disorder) was largely based upon Applicant\u2019s \nneed for further treatment, and a need for more time to pass to see if Applicant could \nmaintain his modified consumption without resorting to binge drinking. Another year and \none-half has passed without evidence of more binge drinking or alcohol-related legal \nproblems, and he sought and received additional treatment. I find that he has \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nacknowledged his pattern of maladaptive alcohol misuse, provided evidence of actions \nto overcome this problem, and demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption. AG \u00b6 23(b) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline G in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered \nApplicant\u2019s positive character references. While, at first blush, an individual who had \nthree DWIs may seem unworthy of holding a security clearance, my adjudicative goal is \nnot to punish an individual for his or her past deeds. He sought treatment, worked to \nchange his relationship with alcohol, and provided evidence of that change through the \npassage of time without legal incidents and without binge drinking. I find that he has \nremoved judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability concerns. He has mitigated the \nGuideline G security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

(Items 1-6) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s 16 delinquent accounts total approximately $27,000. These debts have \nbeen delinquent since at least 2014 and remain delinquent. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual has initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant bears the burdens of production and persuasion in mitigation. An \napplicant is not held to a standard of perfection in her debt-resolution efforts or required \nto be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is than an applicant act responsibly given his \ncircumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). \nApplicant attributed her financial delinquencies to loss of employment beginning in \nFebruary 2014. There is no evidence of any debt-resolution efforts from January 2015, \nwhen she found employment, to September 2023, after the SOR was issued. All 16 SOR \naccounts remain unpaid. The absence of reasonable efforts undertaken by her to resolve \nthese long-standing financial delinquencies is concerning, especially after her submission \nof the March 2022 SCA and the April 2023 financial interrogatory, both of which alerted \nher to the government\u2019s concerns about her overall financial indebtedness. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must establish circumstances largely beyond her \ncontrol and that she acted responsibly under the circumstances. Notwithstanding the \nfinancial hardship due to her unemployment from February 2014 through January 2015, \nApplicant has not established that she acted responsibly to address and resolve her \ndelinquent accounts despite being employed for the past nine years. There is no evidence \nshowing any debt payments or repayment plans she has in place for the SOR debts, or \nany additional communication with creditors regarding these accounts. I am unable to find \nthat her current financial situation is under control or that additional financial problems will \nnot develop in the future. None of the financial mitigating conditions apply. Applicant did \nnot mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant was aware she had developed multiple unpaid and delinquent accounts \nafter she was unemployed from February 2014 through January 2015. In March 2022 she \ndisclosed one delinquent department store account for $2,000 on her SCA. She \ndeliberately failed to disclose additional adverse financial information or provide an \naccurate description of her overall current financial indebtedness on the SCA, as required. \nThe above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant made a good-faith effort to correct the omission \nof relevant and material information on the March 2022 SCA before she was confronted \nwith 16 delinquent accounts that were listed on her June 2022 credit bureau report. She \ndenied intentionally falsifying her SCA in her SOR Answer, but she did not provide a \nreasonable explanation for the omission. I find that Applicant intentionally omitted \nforthright and candid information about her significant financial indebtedness, and her \nomission casts doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) \nand (c) do not apply. Applicant failed to mitigate the personal conduct security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E and \nthe factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant experienced financial hardship when she became unemployed in \nFebruary 2014. This is a situation beyond her control; however, she has not provided \nsufficient evidence to establish that she has acted responsibly to address and resolve her \nfinancial delinquencies. She also did not provide an explanation in her Answer why she \ndid not disclose relevant information on the March 2022 SCA to accurately reflect her \ncurrent financial predicament. Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations and \npersonal conduct security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.p.: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Applicant is a 25-year-old maintenance clerk employed by a federal contractor since June 2022. He served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from August 2016 to August 2020 and received an honorable discharge. While on active duty, he received nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for misusing a government travel card for personal expenses, including caring for his wife\u2019s family members. He was reduced in rank from pay grade E-4 to E-3. His nonjudicial punishment is alleged in SOR \u00b61.h. Applicant held a security clearance while on active duty, but it was suspended because of his misuse of the government travel card. He does not currently have a security clearance.

Applicant \nsubmitted no evidence of efforts to resolve these debts. They are not resolved. \nIn response to financial interrogatories in April 2023, Applicant submitted a \npersonal financial statement reflecting net monthly income of $3,682 (based solely on his \nsalary) and monthly expenses of $3,212, leaving a net monthly remainder of $670. \n(FORM Item 6 at 7) He did not list any debt payments such as his monthly payments of \n$327 to the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence of the seven delinquent debts establish \ntwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) \nand AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). His admitted misuse of a \ngovernment travel card establishes the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 19(d) (\u201cdeceptive \nor illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, expense \naccount fraud, mortgage fraud, filing deceptive loan statements and other intentional \nfinancial breaches of trust\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established for the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, and were not incurred under \ncircumstances making recurrence unlikely. It is established for the misuse of the \ngovernment travel card, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, which was a one-time occurrence that was \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmore than four years ago and is unlikely to recur because Applicant no longer has a \nlimited-use credit card. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established for the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant has encountered several conditions that were largely beyond his control: his \nmarital separation, the financial responsibility for his younger sister, and the damage to \nan apartment inflicted by his wife\u2019s family. However, he has not acted responsibly. He has \nbeen gainfully employed since June 2022. His personal financial statement reflects a \nreasonable net remainder after he pays all his financial obligations. Nevertheless, with \nthe exception of the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e, he submitted no evidence of \ncontacts with his creditors or other attempts to resolve the debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of financial \ncounseling. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and 1.e, but not for \nthe other debts alleged in the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant has not disputed any of the debts alleged \nin the SOR. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003).

She stated that she has been a \nsingle mother since she was four months pregnant. From 2017 to 2019, she was also \nresponsible for taking care of her stepfather who had been in a very serious head-on \ncar collision and needed around the clock medical attention. During that period, she \nalso went through gall bladder surgery. In 2019, she was sexually assaulted by her \nson\u2019s father, and she stopped working in December 2019. She won physical and sole \ncustody of her son, and spent about two whole weeks intermittently in court fighting her \nson\u2019s father on this issue. His sexual assault charge was dismissed. She returned to \nwork in February 2020. \nApplicant stated that she was also young and dumb, and at times she spent \nmoney without thought or concern.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial hardship.  Her actions or inactions both \ndemonstrate a history of not addressing her debt and/or an inability to do so. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant has incurred delinquent debt that she cannot afford to pay. Some of \nher debt was due to hardship and difficulties. Other debt she caused by frivolous \noverspending. Since she has incurred the debt, she has done nothing to resolve it. \nThere is no evidence of any debt consolidation, payment plans, or any effort to settle or \nmediate her debts. She has not made a good faith effort to address her indebtedness, \nand each of the delinquent debts listed in the SOR remain owing. \nIt is noted that Applicant and her son reside with her parents and share or split \nthe rent and monthly expenses for their apartment. That is one method of showing that \nshe is making an effort to reduce her expenses. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s financial \nirresponsibility and inaction for so long casts doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant appears to want to resolve her debt, but \nshe has lots of work to do to achieve this. In fact, she has not even started the process. \nApplicant has not addressed any of her delinquent debts. If a security clearance is \nsomething she truly wishes to obtain, she must work diligently at showing the \nGovernment that she can live within her means, and properly resolve her financial \ndelinquencies. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. \nApplicant has not made a good faith effort to resolve her debts. \nOverall, \nApplicant owes a significant amount of money to her creditors and has made no effort to \nresolve the debt. There is insufficient evidence in the record to show that the Applicant \nhas carried her burden of proof to establish mitigation of the government security \nconcerns under Guideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nIn the event that \nApplicant realizes how to properly address her financial delinquencies and makes a \ncommitment to show financial responsibility, sometime in the future she may be found to \nbe sufficiently reliable to properly protect and access classified information, but not at \nthis time. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.n.  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960); Department of Defense (DoD) Directive \n5220.6 Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, (January 2, \n1992) (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A \nthe National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, \n2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                          \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                          \nApplicant responded to the SOR (undated) and requested a hearing.

The transcript (Tr.) was received on \nJanuary 4, 2024. \n Procedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit her the opportunity to supplement the record with documented additional \npayment information on his SOR-covered delinquent accounts. For good cause shown, \nApplicant was granted 14 days to supplement the record. Department Counsel was \nafforded seven days to respond. Within the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the \nrecord with documented settlements with SOR creditors information 1.b-1.c and other \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s submissions were admitted without objection as AEs E-I. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant allegedly accumulated four \ndelinquent debts exceeding $25,000. Allegedly, his delinquent debts remain unresolved \nand outstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations covered by SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d with explanations. He denied the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and \n1.c with explanations. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

(AEs H-I; Tr. 33-\n39)  \nAfter making several payments in April 2022 on his co-signed motorcycle loan, \nApplicant ceased making payments before resuming his payments in September and \nOctober 2022, respectively. (Tr. 32-39) In September 2023, he made one lump sum \npayment to SOR creditor 1.a to fully settle the debts for a reduced amount of $4,644. \n(AE E; Tr. 40-41) \nAddressing his remaining listed debts, Applicant as no recollection of these listed \nmedical accounts, and he disputed both accounts with three credit reporting agencies \nFinding these reported medical accounts to be unsubstantiated, the credit reporting \nagencies deleted them from his credit reports in 2023. (AE F) Applicant\u2019s only remaining \ndelinquent account concerned a motorcycle loan he co-signed for his son in March 2018 \nfor $21,237. (GEs 4-7 and AE G; Tr. Tr. 53-54) Applicant\u2019s son had ceased making \npayments in 2018 and returned the vehicle to the seller on the advice of Applicant. (GEs \n4-7; Tr. 46-47) Applicant has since settled the account for a reduced amount of \n$13,766. (AE G; Tr. 47-48) \nApplicant currently grosses $82,000 annually and nets $5,000 a month. (Tr. 49) \nHis wife earns $20 an hour but no longer shares their monthly household expenses with \nhim. (Tr. 48-49) Applicant owns one car and makes the monthly payments for both his \ncar and his wife\u2019s vehicle for a total of $600 a month. (Tr. 50) \nIn October 2023, Applicant paid off the balances due on his credit cards with the \nrefinancing of his home. (Tr. 51-52) Before resuming responsibility for handling his car \npayments and other expenses in December 2020, he relied on his wife to make the \nrequired payments and monitor their accounts. (AE H; Tr 53) Most of his delinquencies \noccurred before his wife took early retirement. (Tr. 54) \nApplicant does not have a retirement account to address emergencies, and he is \nworking on a monthly budget without the aid of formal financial counseling.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. \nThese guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be considered before deciding \nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n  Financial Considerations \n           The Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds  .  .  .  . AG \u00b6 18.   \n  Burdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information.

These debt delinquencies warrant the application of two of \nthe disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position.

In \nApplicant\u2019s case, his medical issues associated with a motorcycle accident and his \nreliance on his son to make the required monthly payments on his co-signed \nmotorcycle loan played some role in his accruing of the two major debts covered by the \nSOR (i.e., SOR creditors 1. a and 1.d). \n6 \n \nApplicable mitigating conditions (MC) include MC \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that \nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstance\u201d; 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and \nis adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d; \nand 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n                \n \n                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. . \nWhile Applicant has been somewhat dilatory about monitoring and addressing \nhis debts, extenuating circumstances and mitigating conditions have been major factors. \nOverall, his debt management initiatives have been encouraging and helped him to \nmeet his evidentiary burdens of demonstrating the responsible requirements of MC \u00b6 \n20(b) for managing her finances. \nFor the two remaining small medical debts he disputed, Applicant successfully \ndisputed them with the three principal credit reporting agencies. In evaluating Guideline \nF cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance of a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d \nthat includes evidence of actual debt reduction through the voluntary payment of \naccrued debts.

Jan. 20, 2020). \nBased on the evidence presented, Applicant is able to demonstrate a sufficient \ntangible track record of actual debt reduction (viz., SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d) to satisfy \nAppeal Board guidance associated with the responsible and good-faith payment \nrequirements of MCs \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d).Applicant\u2019s remaining medical debts were \nsuccessfully disputed and removed from his credit reports. \nWhole-person assessment \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.    \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance. Taking into account Applicant\u2019s credited defense contributions, his \nextenuating circumstances associated with his medical issues and over reliance on his \nson to manage his cosigned motorcycle loan, he has shown sufficient responsibility in \nregaining control of his finances to enable his to meet minimum standards for holding a \nsecurity clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nGuideline F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1d:          \n7 \n         For Applicant  \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \u201cThe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of \nthe Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of nexus \nis not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd.

See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b). \nCriminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and  \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nApplicant was arrested for Assault and Battery of a Family Member in February \n2015 and in May 2022. These misdemeanor-level offenses are serious in that they \nentailed a risk of bodily injury to his live-in girlfriend in 2015 and his wife in May 2022. As \nof the date of the SOR, Applicant was on probation for the May 2022 offense until \nNovember 2024. Applicant was also charged with violating the protective order issued to \nhim as a result of the May 2022 incident on two occasions in June 2022 and September \n2022. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 31(b), and 31(c) are established. I do note that AG \u00b6 31(c) was \napplicable when he was on probation. It is no longer applicable because he is no longer \non probation. \nAG \u00b6 32 describes four conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) applies. It has been more than nine years since the February 2015 \narrest.  Applicant and his girlfriend were in a troubled relationship. After the February 2015 \nincident they agreed to part ways. \n \n Applicant successfully attended a relationship class as \npart of his deferred disposition agreement for this offense. He met all of the terms of the \nagreement. He has since matured and he and his former girlfriend, the mother of his child, \nhave a good relationship focused on co-parenting their daughter. It has been more than \ntwo years since the May 2022 incident involving Applicant\u2019s then wife. The record is not \nclear that he actually assaulted his wife during the argument. Regardless, Applicant \nagreed to attend another deferred disposition program. He successfully completed a 32-\nweek domestic violence course and was released early from the terms of his probation. \nHe testified that he learned a lot from the course which he hopes to apply to future \nrelationships. He and his wife separated after the May 2022 incident and are now divorced. \nAG \u00b6 32(b) does not apply based on the facts of this case. There is no evidence \nApplicant was pressured or coerced into committing the act. \nAG \u00b6 32(c) applies with respect to the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d related to his alleged \nviolations of the protective order to stay away from his wife. Regarding the May 2022 \noffense alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, he contacted his wife\u2019s mother to explain why he was \nbreaking up with her daughter. While he probably did not use the best judgment when \ncontacting his mother-in-law, he did not violate the protective order because the protective \norder at that time only covered that he have no contact with his wife. His communication \nwith his mother-in-law was not threatening to his wife or his mother-in-law. The disposition \nof the offense was Nolle Prosequi. \nAG \u00b6 32(c) applies with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.d, because Applicant was acquitted by \nthe judge on this allegation. While Applicant and his wife were in the courthouse at the \nsame time, he did not attempt to communicate with her. He was with his father. They sat \nin an area that they thought was private and discovered his wife was sitting nearby. She \nimmediately ran out of the area and filed for a violation of the protective order. The \ncourthouse cameras revealed Applicant did not attempt to communicate with his wife so \nhe was found not guilty. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d) applies because Applicant has provided evidence of successful \nrehabilitation. He met all of the terms of his probation. In fact, he was released early from \nprobation related to the May 2022 offense. He has not had any subsequent criminal \noffenses since May 2022. He has since matured and developed a good rapport with his \nformer girlfriend, the mother of his child. He and his wife separated after the May 2022 \nincident and are divorced. He has no contact with her. Finally, he has a good employment \nrecord. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline J are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee working for a defense contractor. I considered \nhe is a high school graduate with technical training. I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \nemployment history for over 11 years. He has moved up after successfully completing \napprenticeships and training. \nWhile the issue of domestic violence is a serious one, the incidents in question \nappear to be mutual arguments which resulted in little to no physical harm. Each charge \nwas a misdemeanor-level offense. Applicant took courses and successfully completed \nhis deferred disposition programs. He has a better understanding of how to interact in \nfuture relationships. Criminal Conduct concerns are mitigated. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n______________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information.
