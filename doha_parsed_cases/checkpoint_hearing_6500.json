FOREMAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nMelvin A. Howry, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant began abusing drugs when he was about 12 years old, and he continues to use\nmarijuana.  He has not mitigated the security concerns based on drug involvement, and he is\nineligible for a clearance under 10 U.S.C. 986(c)(2).  Clearance is denied.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a security\nclearance.  This action was taken Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and\nmodified (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines approved by the President on December\n29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006 (AG).  The SOR alleged security concerns\nraised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement).  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on June 26,\n2007, admitted 10 of the 13 allegations, and elected to have the case decided on the written record\nin lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on July 26, 2007.\nA complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was\nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ndisqualifying conditions. Applicant received the FORM on August 4, 2007, but did not respond.  The\ncase was assigned to me on October 5, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL RULING\nTwo allegations in the SOR are lettered as subparagraph 1.d.  On my own motion, I have\nmade pen changes to correct the lettering of one of those subparagraphs and all following\nsubparagraphs.  I also have amended the last subparagraph in the SOR to conform to the evidence\nby adding an allegation that Applicant\u2019s conduct alleged in subparagraphs 1.l (as corrected)\ndisqualifies him from holding a clearance under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986, as amended. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  He admitted all the allegations of drug involvement, except the purchase of cocaine\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d and the purchase of crystal methamphetamine alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h.  He did\nnot answer the allegation that his drug involvement makes him ineligible for a security clearance\nunder 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986, as amended.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 29-year-old research associate for a defense contractor.  He graduated from\nhigh school in June 1996, and graduated from college in December 2001.  He began working for his\ncurrent employer in May 2004.  He has never held a security clearance.\nApplicant purchased marijuana from 1992 to January 2007.  He used it from 1989, when he\nwas about 12 years old, until at least January 22, 2007.  He was arrested in 1993 for possession of\nmarijuana, attempted to grow marijuana plants in 1995, and sold it to friends while he was in high\nschool.  In a written statement to a security investigator in May 2002 (GX 5 at 2-3), he declared, \u201cI\nplan to continue smoking marijuana, but if for some reason it will affect my employment with [a\nfederal contractor], I will quit using it.\u201d  He admitted his continuing marijuana use in his answer to\nthe SOR on June 26, 2007.\n\n3\nApplicant purchased and used LSD about 20 times between 1992 and 1998, purchased and\nused crystal methamphetamine about three times between 1994 and 1996, and purchased and used\ncocaine about 25 times between 1995 and 2000.  \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAbsent a waiver from the Director, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, the Department\nof Defense may not grant a security clearance to any applicant who \u201cis an unlawful user of, or is\naddicted to, a controlled substance.\u201d  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(2), as amended.  Marijuana is a controlled\nsubstance as defined in the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802. \nCONCLUSIONS\n\n4\nGuideline H\u2014Drug Involvement\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a\nprescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d  AG \u00b6 24. Disqualifying conditions under\nthis guideline include \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d and \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation,\nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d  AG\n\u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c). Drug abuse is \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that\ndeviates from approved medical direction.\u201d AG \u00b6 24(b). The evidence raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c).\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c), the burden\nshifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of\ndisproving it is never shifted to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep.\n22, 2005).  Applicant presented nothing to rebut, explain, or mitigate the facts.  None of the\nenumerated mitigating conditions under this guideline are established.\nThe Whole Person\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuideline H, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a)(1)-(9).  \nApplicant is a mature adult who has abused drugs since adolescence, and he has declared his\nintention to continue using marijuana.  He has exhibited no concern that his conduct is illegal or\nunacceptable.  Although he stated in May 2002 that he would quit using marijuana if it affected his\nemployment by a federal contractor, he answered the SOR in June 2007 by admitting he intends to\ncontinue his marijuana, and he submitted nothing in response to the FORM.  I conclude he will likely\ncontinue using marijuana and will remain vulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying conditions under Guideline H and the absence of mitigating\nevidence, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant\nhas not mitigated the security concerns based on his drug involvement.  Accordingly, I conclude he\nhas not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nhim a security clearance.\n\n5\nSmith Amendment (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986, as amended)\nApplicant\u2019s continuing use of marijuana makes him ineligible for a clearance under 10\nU.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(2), as amended, unless a waiver is granted by the Director, DOHA.  I would deny\nApplicant a clearance based on his long history of drug abuse, even if 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(2) were\nnot applicable to his case.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline H (Drug Involvement):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-m:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.  Clearance is denied.\nLeRoy F. Foreman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nJanuary 13, 2009\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on February 7,\n2005 (Government Exhibit 1).  On April 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline F concerning the Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on May 6, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non June 9, 2008.  I received the case assignment on June 16, 2008.  DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on July 10, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on August\n13, 2008. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 7, which were\n\n2\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and requested that the\nrecord stay open for presentation of additional information.  The Applicant submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A, which was received without objection.  DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing on August 20, 2008.  The record closed on August 27, 2008.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 48, retired from the Armed Forces, and married.  He is\nemployed by a defense contractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance in\nconnection with his employment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he is financially overextended and therefore at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  The Applicant admits all of the allegations in\nthis paragraph of the SOR. \nThe Applicant submits that the majority of his financial problems began when his\nwife left her job with the United States Postal Service in 2000.  She has not been\nemployed since that time.  (Transcript at 27-28.)  However, the Applicant later testified\nthat his financial problems actually began about 2004.  (Transcript at 29-30.)\nThe Applicant signed up with a debt consolidation company in January 2008.\n(Government Exhibit 2 at 5.)  He testified that he has a direct deposit to this company of\n$109.00 a month.  They are supposed to negotiate payment arrangements with three of\nhis creditors. He had no information as to whether this company has made any\npayments to his creditors and, if so, how much has been paid.  The Applicant further\nstated that this company indicated his debts will be paid off within three years.\n(Transcript at 30-31, 41-42.)  As will be further discussed, below, he is paying the\ncreditor in paragraph 1.b. separately. \nDuring his testimony, the Applicant was often vague about the state of his\nfinancial affairs.  He explained that his wife handled the finances, as she had when he\nwas in the Service.  (Transcript at 46-47.)  At one point he stated, \u201cI should keep an eye\non my financial business.\u201d  (Transcript at 42.)\n1.a.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to Cach LLC as the result of a\njudgment entered against him in the amount of $3,847.00.  (Government Exhibit 7 at 1.)\nThe Applicant has made no payments on this debt, but has turned this debt over to his\ncredit consolidation company.  (Transcript at 25, 37-38.)    \n1.b.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to UNLV/Citi in the amount of\n$846.00.  The Applicant has been making payments on this account himself of $75.00 a\n\n3\nmonth.  As of the day of the hearing, this debt had been reduced to $171.00.\n(Government Exhibit 6 at 1; Government Exhibit 7 at 2; Transcript at 38-41.)\n1.c.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to Citi in the amount of\n$4,556.00.  The Applicant has made no payments on this debt, but has turned this debt\nover to his credit consolidation company.  (Transcript at 27.)    \n1.d.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to Beneficial/HFC in the amount\nof $4,527.00.  The Applicant has made no payments on this debt, but has turned this\ndebt over to his credit consolidation company.  (Transcript at 29.)\nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, containing his DD 214, two letters\nof achievement from his employer, and his performance evaluations from 2002 through\n2008.  They show him to be a highly respected employee, who is consistently rated as\n\u201cOutstanding\u201d in his work.    \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The Applicant, by his own admission, has over $13,000.00 in past\ndue debts, all of which have been due and owing for several years. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\n\n5\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose primarily between about 2000 and 2004.  However, it took him\nuntil 2008 to begin to pay off any of the past due indebtedness.  In addition, the\nevidence is meager as to how much he has paid.  It is the Applicant\u2019s burden to submit\nevidence showing that his financial situation has improved.  He has not done so.  This\nmitigating condition is not applicable to this case.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment . . .), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.\u201d  The Applicant\u2019s wife left her job in 2000 and has not worked since.\nWith the available record, I cannot find that this act is sufficient to mitigate his long-term\nfailure to pay his debts.  I cannot find, under these particular facts, that the Applicant\nhas acted responsibly under the circumstances.\nThe Applicant has barely initiated a good-faith effort to pay off his creditors.\nThere is no track record of his making payments for a consistent period of time.\nAccordingly, AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable.  Finally, given the fact that he is $13,000.00 in\ndebt, I cannot find that \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or\nis under control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a respected\nemployee who is under financial strain, and has been for several years.  He has not\nmade a sufficient showing that his debt situation is under control.  Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(3),\nthe Applicant\u2019s conduct is recent.  Based on the state of the record, I cannot find that\nthere have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  Accordingly, at the\n\n6\npresent time, I cannot find that there is little to no potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)8)), or that the likelihood of recurrence is close to nil\n(AG \u00b6 2(a)9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations at this time.  If he continues to pay down his debts, and is able to\ndocument these payments, he may be eligible for a clearance in the future.  He is not\neligible now.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Nagel, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nMarch 24, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn October 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 5, 2007, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on November 27, 2007. Applicant filed an\nundated response to the FORM.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and\nexhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 50 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nTwo Notices of Federal tax liens were filed against applicant. In February 2004, a\nNotice of Tax lien in the amount of $19,233.00 was filed. And, in June 2005, a Notice of\nTax lien in the amount of $9,155.00 was filed. In April 2007, applicant entered into an\nagreement with the IRS requiring him to make monthly payments of $650.00 to the IRS\nin exchange for the IRS withdrawing the tax lien notices. Pay stubs applicant provided in\nresponse to the SOR show $650.00 a month in payments are being deducted from his\npaycheck. A letter from the IRS he attached to his response to the FORM indicates the\nIRS has begun the process of withdrawing the tax lien notices.\nA State tax lien in the amount of $5,547.00 was filed against applicant in April\n2007. This debt has not been paid. In his response to the SOR, applicant stated it has\nnot been paid because he is \u201cquestioning the amount and would like to see a copy of\nthe tax return.\u201d\nApplicant paid the $2,287.00 Collectibles Mgmt Resour/Enterprising Leasing debt\nin January 2006.\nThe Chase debt appears to be the same debt as the UNIFUND debt, which now\nstands at $12,400.23. Applicant entered into a repayment agreement with the creditor\non November 2, 2007 which required applicant to make an initial payment of $1,240.00\nby December 2, 2007, and monthly payments of $232.50 thereafter until the debt is paid\nin full. There is no evidence that applicant made the required payments.\nApplicant satisfied the $467.00 First Premier debt in or before October 2007.\nApplicant satisfied the debt to CAP 1 BANK, in the approximate amount of\n$1,100.00, in November 2007.\nApplicant satisfied the $423.00 Arrow Financial debt in November 2007.\nApplicant satisfied the $1,792.00 debt to ANDREWS FCU in November 2007.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\n\n3\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nParagraph 18 of the new AG sets out the security concern relating to financial\nconsiderations:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nUnder Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise\nsecurity concerns. The evidence shows applicant has a history of not meeting his\nfinancial obligations based on an inability or unwillingness to do so. These disqualifying\nconditions are therefore applicable.\nThe guidelines also set out some potentially mitigating conditions. Paragraph\n20.a. may apply where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual*s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant has\n\n4\nnot provided any reasonable explanation for his failure to honor his financial\nobligations. Accordingly, it is impossible to conclude this behavior will not recur. This\nmitigation condition does not apply.\nParagraph 20.d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant has\nresolved, or is in the process of resolving, most of the debts listed in the SOR. This\nmitigation condition applies.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the\ncircumstances. An AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at\nAG Paragraph 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature man who\naccumulated and failed to repay a significant amount of debt. Although he has made\nsignificant progress in dealing with these debts by either paying them or making\narrangements to pay them over time, much of his unsecured debt remains. It is fair to\nsay he still owes over $30,000.00 in back taxes and approximately $11,000.00 to\nUNIFUND. In addition, he has failed to offer any reasonable explanation for\naccumulating so much delinquent debt. Without such information, there is no way to\nconclude his history of financial difficulties will not recur. Based on these facts, I have\nno choice but to conclude applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from\nGuideline F.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n5\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

He is considered a \nprofessional who is dedicated and can be trusted to complete the task without \nsupervision.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n3 AE A, B, C, D, E, W. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is \nfinancially over-extended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including \nespionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 for financial \nconsiderations that could raise a security concern and have especially considered AG \u00b6 \n19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and (c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations). Applicant had debts that remained unpaid for a substantial period \nof time that he only recently began to pay. Due to his unemployment, under \nemployment and lack of medical insurance, he has been unable to pay many of these \ndebts. I find both AG \u00b6 19 (a) and (c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security \nconcerns. I have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered (a) \n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), (b) (the conditions that resulted in \nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), (c) (the \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control), (d) (the individual \ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts), and \n(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt \nwhich is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the \nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue).  \n \nApplicant had numerous debts that were in collection status or charged off. He \nrecently settled and paid many of his delinquent debts, but others remain that he is \nworking on paying or attempting to resolve. I find (a) does not apply because his \nbehavior was not infrequent and he is still resolving his financial problems, and \n\n \n6 \n \n \ntherefore they are recent. Some conditions that contributed to Applicant\u2019s financial \ndifficulties were beyond his control. He was unemployed for periods of time and did not \nhave medical insurance. However, Applicant also admitted that he made poor financial \ndecisions that also contributed to his problems. I find (b) partially applies. No evidence \nwas presented that Applicant has received or is receiving counseling for his financial \nproblems. Therefore, I find (c) does not apply. Applicant has made a sustained, \ndeliberate, good-faith effort to resolve and pay his delinquent debts and has made \nsubstantial progress. He has paid some delinquent debts, negotiated, settled and paid \nothers, and written letters to resolve and determine the legitimacy of others. I find both \n(d) and (e) apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was a young man who \nwas provided very little direction in his life. He had low paying jobs, no medical \ninsurance, and made some poor financial decisions. He has forged a new positive \ndirection in his life. He has put forth a sustained and substantial effort to pay his \ndelinquent debts and has made significant progress. He is considered a valuable \ntrusted coworker, who is admired by those with whom he works. He made some \nmistakes as a young man, but has learned from them and is actively taking corrective \naction. He is a productive and valuable employee. Although he had financial problems, \nhe has resolved many of his debts and is committed to paying all of remaining \noutstanding debts. He estimates he has approximately $5,000 in remaining debts. \nApplicant\u2019s actions convince me that he is not a security risk.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from financial considerations.  \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCAROL G.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 28, 2007. He answered \nthe SOR in writing on September 8, 2007, and elected to have the case decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nwritten case on October 18, 2007. A complete copy of the file of relevant material \n(FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections \nand submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions. \nApplicant received the FORM on October 31, 2007. As of December 10, 2007, he had \nJanuary 9, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nnot responded. I received the case assignment on December 13, 2007. Based upon a \nreview of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated September 8, 2007, Applicant admitted all the \nfactual allegations in the SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 24-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is a high school \ngraduate. He is married and has a six-year-old daughter.1 Applicant has an extensive \namount of delinquent debt. He admitted to all the debts listed in the SOR. There is no \nevidence that any of the debts have been paid. Individual debts are discussed below. \n \n \nThe credit bureau reports (CBR) of August 30, 2006 and April 9, 2007, both list a \ndelinquent debt to a collection agency in the amount of $351, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nBoth credit reports list the date of last activity (DLA) as March 2003. The collection \nagency was assigned the debt for collection by a wireless telephone provider. In his \ninterview with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator on September \n28, 2006, Applicant stated that he would contact the wireless telephone provider and \nmake payment arrangements.2 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.f allege medical debts of $231 and $283. The CBR of August \n30, 2006, lists these debts as collected by a collection agency. The CBR of April 9, \n2007, does not list the name of the creditor. The CBRs list the DLA as March 2003, and \nJanuary 2005. Applicant told the investigator that he was not sure what these accounts \nwere for, but that if they were his accounts he would make arrangements to pay the \naccounts.3 \n \n \n \nApplicant purchased a motorcycle in about March 2004. His mother co-signed for \nthe loan. Applicant lost his job, and his mother called the loan company and told them to \ntake the motorcycle, initiating a voluntary repossession in about May 2004. The CBRs \nlist a remaining balance of $5,927, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c.4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a debt to a loan company of $307. Both CBRs list this debt \nwith a DLA of March 2005. Applicant told the investigator that he agreed with this \naccount but could not recall who the exact creditor was. He stated he would attempt to \ncontact the creditor and pay the debt.5 \n \n                                                          \n1 Item 4. \n \n2 Items 5-7. \n \n3 Id. \n \n4 Id. \n \n5 Id. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nThe two CBRs list a delinquent debt to a furniture store, as collected by a \ncollection company, for $2,381 and $2,183. SOR \u00b6 1.e alleges the debt with the lesser \namount. The DLA for the debt to the furniture store is listed as March 2005. Applicant \nstated in his background interview that he and his mother bought furniture and he \nthought that his mother was paying on this account. He told the investigator that he \nwould call his mother and check on the status of the account. He said if his mother had \nnot been making payments that he would make the payments in the future.6 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a debt to a collection company for $997, on behalf of an \napartment building. The DLA on the CBRs is October 2005. Applicant told the OPM \ninvestigator this debt was for an apartment lease he co-signed for his cousin. He stated \nhe was unaware his cousin had not maintained payments, and he would contact his \ncousin and make sure the payments were made continuously and on time.7  \n \n \nThe two CBRs list a delinquent debt to a bank in the amount of $4,408 for a \nreturned check, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. The DLA is December 2005. Applicant told the \nOPM investigator that he obtained a loan and gave the proceeds to his brother so that \nhis brother could complete school. He stated he placed the check in the creditor bank \nand was told that it would take three days to clear. Applicant told the investigator that \nhaving been made aware of the balance that he would make some type of arrangement \nto pay the creditor.8 \n \n \nThe CBR of April 9, 2007, lists two medical debts, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and \n1.j, for $335 and $1,888. The name of the actual creditor is not listed. The DLA for both \ndebts is November 2005. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k through 1.m allege three debts to a collection \nagency, for debts of $1,437, $742, and $248. The debts are listed on the CBR of April 9, \n2007, all with a DLA of August 2005.9 \n \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for National Security Positions \n(SF 86) signed on May 2, 2006, and initialed on July 19, 2006. Applicant answered \n\u201cNO\u2019\u201d to all the pertinent financial questions on the SF 86. Question 28a asked, \u201cIn the \nlast 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d Question 28b \nasked, \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d In his background \ninterview, Applicant denied intentionally falsifying the questionnaire. He admitted the \ntwo falsification allegations in the SOR. An admission to a falsification allegation is not \nabsolutely binding on an Administrative Judge, particularly where there is an additional \nexplanation that serves to undercut the admission.10 In this case there are no additional \nexplanations in Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, only the words \u201cI admit.\u201d Applicant \n                                                          \n6 Id. \n \n7 Id. \n \n \n8 Id. \n \n9 Item 6. \n \n10 ISCR Case No. 02-21087 (App. Bd. Aug. 19, 2005). \n\n \n4 \n \n \nsubmitted the SF 86 in 2006. He had a number of debts that were placed for collection \nin 2005, or earlier. He had explanations about why he did not know that certain of the \ndebts were delinquent. I find that his explanations do not adequately explain his failure \nto disclose that he had delinquent debts. After considering all the evidence, including \nApplicant\u2019s statement to the investigator and his admissions in his response to the SOR, \nI find Applicant knew he had delinquent debts when be submitted the SF 86, and that he \nintentionally falsified these two questions. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n5 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. The evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is sufficient to raise \nthese potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all the potential mitigating \nconditions, and especially considered AG \u00b6 20(a) Athe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment,@ AG & 20(b) Athe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances,@ AG & 20(c) Athe person has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control,@ AG & 20(d) Athe individual initiated a good-faith \neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,@ and AG & 20(e) \u201cthe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant paid any of the debts as alleged in the SOR. \nHe did not dispute owing any of the debts. Applicant blamed the repossession of the \nmotorcycle on the loss of his job. He did not provide any information on how long he \nwas unemployed. He stated that his mother did not make payments on the furniture \nthey bought together and that his cousin must not have paid the rent on the apartment \nApplicant co-signed for him. These events are conditions, which if credible, could be \nconsidered as beyond Applicant\u2019s control. Applicant did not explain all his debts or what \nif any affect his unemployment had on his finances. There is also no evidence that he \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has not shown a good-faith effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, and there is no clear indication \nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control. I do not find any of the mitigating \nconditions to be fully applicable.  \n \n Guideline E, Personal Conduct  \n  \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and, \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Applicant\u2019s intentional falsification of his security clearance application \nraises two disqualifying conditions. They are AG \u00b6 16(a) \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d and AG \u00b6 16(e) \n\u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, that creates a \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities \nwhich, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered all the potential mitigating conditions and I especially considered AG \u00b6 17(a) \n\u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or \nfalsification before being confronted with the facts,\u201d AG \u00b6 17(b) \u201cthe refusal or failure to \ncooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly contributed to by \nimproper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or \ninstructing the individual specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon \nbeing made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully,\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c) \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so \nmuch time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such \nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d) \u201cthe individual has \nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken \nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur,\u201d and AG \u00b6 17(e) \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d Applicant submitted his SF 86 in \nmid-2006. He deliberately failed to disclose significant delinquent debt. Applicant has \nnot submitted sufficient credible information to establish any of the mitigating conditions. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a history of shirking \nhis financial responsibilities. He intentionally provided false information on his security \nclearance questionnaire. He provided very little additional information about his job \nperformance or background.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns based on his financial issues and personal conduct. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact, below. Findings of Fact The Applicant is 58, married, and has a Post-Graduate degree. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry. In his Answer to the SOR, the Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Paragraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts and interests that could lead to the exercise of poor judgment, unreliability or untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant. The Applicant, who is a native born American citizen, and his immediate family all live in the United States. This includes his Russian born wife and her daughter, as well as his children by a previous marriage to an American citizen. The Applicant and his 3 wife were married January 22, 2004. His wife and step-daughter emigrated to the United States on May 17, 2005. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L.) The Applicant retired from the United States Armed Forces as a field grade officer. Beginning in February 1999, his last duty assignment was to a Department of Defense organization that was involved in negotiations with the Russian government. This entailed several trips to Russia over the following years. The Applicant retired from this position in September 2002. (Transcript at 33-35, ;",

Lisiecki, III, Esquire\nBello & Lisiecki, LLP\nJanuary 27, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on April 28, 2006 (Government Exhibit 1). On September 18, 2007, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nto the Applicant, which detailed security concerns under Guideline B of the Directive\ndescribing why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether\na clearance should be denied or revoked. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29,\n\n2\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 3, 2007. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on November 16, 2007, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July 17, 2008.\nThe case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on July 17, 2008.  The case\nwas transferred to me on August 4, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August\n4, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on August 13, 2008. The\nGovernment offered Government Exhibits 1 and 2, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A\nthrough N, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on\nAugust 20, 2008.  The record closed on August 20, 2008.  Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to the Russian Federation (Russia). (Transcript at 8-11.) The\nrequest and the attached documents were not admitted into evidence, but are included\nin the record. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact,\nbelow. \nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 58, married, and has a Post-Graduate degree.  He is employed\nby a defense contractor and seeks a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment in the defense industry.  In his Answer to the SOR, the Applicant admitted\nall of the factual allegations.  He also provided additional information to support his\nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)  \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has foreign contacts and interests that could lead to the exercise\nof poor judgment, unreliability or untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\nThe Applicant, who is a native born American citizen, and his immediate family all\nlive in the United States.  This includes his Russian born wife and her daughter, as well\nas his children by a previous marriage to an American citizen.  The Applicant and his\n\n3\nwife were married January 22, 2004.  His wife and step-daughter emigrated to the\nUnited States on May 17, 2005.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L.)\nThe Applicant retired from the United States Armed Forces as a field grade\nofficer.  Beginning in February 1999, his last duty assignment was to a Department of\nDefense organization that was involved in negotiations with the Russian government.\nThis entailed several trips to Russia over the following years.  The Applicant retired from\nthis position in September 2002.  (Transcript at 33-35, ;Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J.)\nFollowing his retirement, the Applicant was employed by two Defense contractors\nto work in Russia in conjunction with the same program.  (Transcript at 36-39, 42-43.)\nHe worked in Russia for another year and during this period he met his now wife.  She\nwas employed by one of the Defense contractors as their office manager.  That is how\nthey met.  (Transcript at 43-46.)  She is currently employed as the administrative\nassistant to the president of a company in the United States.  Her annual salary is\napproximately $60,000.00 plus equity shares in the company.  (Transcript at 99-100;\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit L at 10.)  The Applicant\u2019s assets in the United States amount to\nabout $120,000.00.  He receives retirement pay from the military as well as his salary.\n(Transcript at 93-95.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s wife owns her apartment in a small city in Russia.  She is also\nhalf owner with her mother of another apartment in the same city.  The combined value\nof this real property is approximately $50,000.00.  However, according to the Applicant,\nthere are so many bureaucratic hurdles to jump through, including the requirement that\nhis wife go to Russia to sell the property, that in reality the property is worthless.  The\nApplicant\u2019s wife signed powers of attorney allegedly transferring all interest in these two\nproperties to her mother.  The Applicant acknowledges that the legal validity of these\ndocuments is questionable.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits D and E; Transcript at 70-73, 90-93.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s wife loves living in the United States, wants to be a citizen, and\nsubmitted her application for American citizenship as soon as she was able to do so, in\nFebruary 2008.  (Transcript at 57-59, 67-68; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L.)  The Applicant\u2019s\nstep-daughter is a legal Permanent Resident of the United States.  She will be eligible\nto apply for citizenship in February 2010, and submitted a sworn statement indicating\nthat she will do so at that time.  (Transcript at 59-61, 68; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)\nThe Applicant traveled to Russia in 2003, 2004 and 2005.  He was not employed\nin the Defense industry at that time.  The trips were made after he had a relationship\nestablished with his now wife, and the trips continued after they were married.  He\nwould stay in Russia for various periods of time, up to several months, during this\nperiod.  During this time he was also caring for his elderly and ill parents in the United\nStates.  (Transcript at 43-51.)\nWhile he was in Russia, the Applicant was asked by an organization connected\nto the United States Government to assist a small Russian company with translations.\nHe eventually worked for four small companies in Russia.  He was paid a nominal sum\n\nAll of the following statements are supported by the documents submitted by the Department Counsel in\n1\nsupport of his request for administrative notice.\n4\nfor his work, approximately $1,300.00.  He has no further connection with any company\nor organization or person in Russia.  (Transcript at 51-55; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.) \nNone of the Applicant\u2019s direct relatives were members of the Communist Party or\nwere connected to the Soviet or Russian defense establishment.  His wife and step-\ndaughter receive no funds of any type from the Russian government. \nThe Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are residents and citizens of\nRussia.  His wife talks to her mother by telephone on an occasional basis. (Transcript at\n70.)  She has no relationship of any type with her father, who divorced her mother when\nthe Applicant\u2019s wife was very young.  (Transcript at 69-70.)  Neither of these relatives\nare members of the Communist Party or were connected to the Soviet or Russian\ndefense establishment.\nThe Applicant has contacts with Russia.  Accordingly, it is appropriate to discuss\nthe situation in Russia at this time.   I take administrative notice of the following facts.\n1\nRussia is a federation made up of 21 republics. Its government has a poor human rights\nrecord and it is plagued with corruption, media suppression, politically motivated crimes,\nand human rights violations. Russia has a significant intelligence capability that it\nretained from the Soviet Union. Russia\u2019s intelligence efforts continue to increase in\nsophistication, scope, and number. It has an aggressive industrial espionage and\nintelligence collection program targeting sensitive and protected U.S. technology.\nRussia\u2019s government sells to other countries technology with application for weapons of\nmass destruction (nuclear and biotechnology) and missiles. It has provided such\ntechnology and support to China, Venezuela, India, and Iran against U.S. wishes.  In\n2008 Russia invaded its neighbor, Georgia, in connection with a long-simmering border\ndispute.  Russia also has a continuing rebellion in Chechnya.\nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted letters and other documents.  They show that the\nApplicant is a highly respected expert in his field, and that he has provided valuable\nservices to the defense efforts of the United States.  People who have worked with him\nin the past, and currently, believe him to be an honest man and recommend him for a\nsecurity clearance.  Several of these people also worked with the Applicant\u2019s wife in\nRussia.  He is also a leader in two Defense related civilian support organizations,\nserving as President for one of them.  (Transcript at 39-42, 63-67; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I.) \nHis officer evaluations show that he was an outstanding officer for his entire\ncareer, successful and well thought of.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J.)\n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n6\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that the Applicant has family members in Russia (Guideline B)\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nThe concern under Guideline B is styled as follows:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in\nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\nThe Applicant\u2019s entire immediate family lives in the United States.  It is obvious\nthat the Applicant spent a great deal of time, trouble and money to move his immediate\nfamily here.   His wife and step-daughter, however, have connections to Russia.  As\ndescribed above, his wife\u2019s mother and father still live in Russia.  She has no\nrelationship whatsoever with her father, but she does contact her mother on an\noccasional basis and twice sent her money.  That relationship cannot be seen as being\ncasual.\nThe evidence is also clear, however, that the Applicant\u2019s wife and step-daughter\nhave acculturated to the American way of life very quickly.  The wife has submitted her\napplication to become an American citizen as early as she could.  As stated by the\nApplicant, she was investigated by the American embassy in Russia, as well as by\nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Services before being allowed to emigrate to\nthe United States.\n\n7\nBased on the evidence the Government has presented, the following\nDisqualifying Conditions apply to this case: 7.(a) Contact with a foreign family member .\n. . who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; (b)\nconnections to a foreign person . . . that create a potential conflict of interest between\nthe individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that information; and (d)\nsharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion.  I have also considered the information concerning the Russian government,\nprovided by Department Counsel in his Administrative Notice documents. \nOn the other hand, the Applicant has provided compelling evidence to show that\nthe following Mitigating Conditions also apply to this particular case, given his\nbackground:  7(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that\ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to\nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government\nand the interests of the U.S.; (b) There is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest; and (c) contact or communication with foreign\ncitizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk\nfor foreign influence or exploitation. \nThe evidence shows that the Applicant was a successful and decorated military\nofficer for 20 years.  Since that time he has put his intelligence and abilities to work for\nseveral Defense contractors, as well as private organizations interested in the defense\nof the United States.  He is respected by his friends and colleagues.  His connections to\nthe United States are deep and long-standing.  The Applicant\u2019s travels to Russia, as\nwell his consulting with several small firms while there, has no current security\nsignificance.  I have also considered his wife\u2019s financial interest in the two apartments in\nRussia, as well as her communications with her mother.  Under the facts of this case,\nespecially given that the wife has a substantial personal income here, those issues have\nlittle security significance.  \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\n\n8\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The personal beliefs of this\nparticular Applicant, a retired officer of undoubted ability who has been extremely\nforthcoming with the Government, are such as to make him an Applicant of the highest\norder.  Based on his actions and testimony, as well as the statements of others, I can\neasily find that there is little or no \u201cpotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress\u201d as set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)(8).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                          \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

CURRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRichard A. Stevens, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s possesses an Iranian passport which he has used on three occasions since 1995\nto facilitate travel to Iran to visit his parents and sister. He has a close relationship with them, talking\nto his parents once per week, and his sister approximately once per month. This generates foreign\npreference and foreign influence security concerns that he failed to mitigate at the hearing. Clearance\nis denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nSee generally, Hearing Exhibits I-VIII.\n1\nTr. 31.\n2\nExhibit 1 at 4.\n3\n2\nOn August 1, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended. He\nanswered the SOR on August 16, 2007, admitting all of the allegations, and requesting a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on September 20, 2007. On October 1, 2007, DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing scheduling it for October 23, 2007. During the hearing, I received two government\nexhibits, one Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. DOHA received the transcript on\nOctober 31, 2007.\nRULINGS ON EVIDENCE\nAt department counsel\u2019s request, I took administrative notice of  several relevant adjudicative\nfacts about Iran. They are as follows:\n1. Iran is hostile to the interests of the United States, and the State Department has designated\nit as a state sponsor of terrorism;\n2. Iran is attempting to acquire weapons of mass destruction;\n3. Iran has an abysmal human rights record. The abuses include summary executions, lack\nof fair public trials, arbitrary arrest and detention, and severe restrictions on civil liberties including\nspeech, press assembly, association, movement, and privacy; and,\n4. Iranian security forces have at times monitored the social activities of its citizens, entered\nhomes and offices, monitored phone conversations, and opened mail without court authorization.1\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nThe SOR admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. In addition, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 48-year-old married man with two children ages 15 and 10. He was born in Iran\nand emigrated to the U.S. in 1978 to attend college. By 1984, he had obtained both an undergraduate\ndegree and a master\u2019s degree in nuclear engineering.  He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2002.\n2\n3\n\nTr. 32.\n4\nTr. 33.\n5\nTr. 36.\n6\nTr. 46.\n7\nTr. 38.\n8\nTr. 40.\n9\nTr. 39.\n10\nTr. 44.\n11\nTr.46.\n12\nTr. 35; Exhibit 2 at 2.\n13\nId.\n14\n3\nCurrently, Applicant is the vice president of development for an information technology\ncompany.  Among other things, he develops secure methods for authenticating identification cards,\n4\nhelps the military develop solutions for identifying friend or foe on the battlefield, and \u201cprovides\nsecurity solutions in currency and documents of value\u201d for banks.  \n5\nBoth of Applicant\u2019s parents are Iranian citizens and residents. His father is a retired banker,\nand his mother is a homemaker.  He talks to them approximately once per week.  Every few years his\n6\n7\nparents visit him in the U.S.  These visits last approximately two to five months.\n8\nApplicant has two sisters. One is a U.S. naturalized citizen and resident.  The other is an\n9\nIranian citizen who currently lives in the United Kingdom with her husband while he attends\ngraduate school. When he finishes, they intend to return to Iran.  Applicant talks to this sister once\n10\nevery one to four weeks.\nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is deceased. His mother-in-law is an Iranian citizen and resident.\nBefore retiring, she worked in a government agency responsible for providing insurance and\nretirement benefits.  Each summer, she travels to the U.S. to visit Applicant\u2019s family, and stays for\n11\nsix to seven months. When she is in Iran, Applicant rarely talks to her.12\nApplicant visited his relatives in Iran in 1995, 1999, and 2001.  In 1995, he obtained an\n13\nIranian passport which he used each time he visited. He only uses his Iranian passport when traveling\nto Iran. He does not use his U.S. passport because the entry process for U.S. citizens is too onerous.14\nHis passport expires in 2011.\nPOLICIES\n\nISCR Case No. 03-12882 (App. Bd. July 20, 2005).\n15\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n16\nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) Paragraph 9.\n17\n4\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those that\nmay be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nThe mere presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not dispositive of\na case.  Instead, their analysis is part of a broader adjudicative process which involves the\n15\nconsideration of all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable. \nAs part of this process, a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d must be\nevaluated. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; (4) the age of the applicant; (5) the extent to which the participation is voluntary; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in\neach case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n16\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that have\nbeen controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the government, and has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nForeign Preference\n\u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d  Here, Applicant\u2019s possession of an Iranian passport\n17\ntriggers the application of Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition 10(a)(1): exercise of any right,\nprivilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign\ncitizenship of a family member [including] possession of a foreign passport. \n\nAG Paragraph 6.\n18\nISCR Case No. 02-04786 (App. Bd. June 27, 2003, at 5).\n19\n5\nApplicant applied for the Iranian passport and used it to travel to Iran before he became a U.S.\ncitizen. When he applied, however, he had been living in the U.S. for 16 years. Also, his only\ntestimony about the Iranian passport was how it facilitated his entry into Iran to enable him to visit\nhis family members; he expressed no intention of destroying it or surrendering it to the cognizant\nsecurity authority. Consequently, Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 11(c): exercise of the\nrights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S.\ncitizen, applies, but has minimal probative value. Applicant has not mitigated the foreign preference\nsecurity concern.\nForeign Influence\n\u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or\ncoercion by any foreign interest.\u201d  Here, Applicant\u2019s contacts with his parents, sister who is an\n18\nIranian citizen and mother-in-law raise the issue of whether Foreign Influence Disqualifying\nCondition (FI DC) 7 a): contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or a resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, applies.\nAlthough friendly countries can engage in activities involving coercion, persuasion or duress of an\nindividual to gather classified information as readily as hostile countries, the risk of such activity is\nheightened with hostile countries because such countries are \u201cnot likely to have scruples about\npressuring one of its citizens\u201d to obtain classified information.  \n19\nIran is both intensely authoritarian and hostile to the United States. Consequently, FI DC 7(a)\napplies to Applicant\u2019s relationship with these family members.\nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. The fact that\nApplicant maintained a strong relationship with his relatives from his country of origin after\nemigrating to the United States is admirable. However, positive attributes in some circumstances can\ngenerate security concerns just as readily as negative ones. In the case of a hostile, authoritarian\ncountry like Iran, Applicant bears a heavy burden to demonstrate that his relationship with family\nmembers who are citizens of Iran does not create a vulnerability to coercion. His argument that it is\nunlikely such coercion would occur because it did not occur 20 years ago when he worked with more\nsensitive information than he does currently, does not meet this burden. He has failed to mitigate the\nforeign influence security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\n\nAG \u00b6\u00b62(a)8-9.\n20\n6\nI have considered all of the whole person factors, particularly the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and the likelihood of continuation.  Applicant\u2019s immediate family\n20\nare all U.S. citizens, and he has lived here for nearly 30 years, obtaining an education, and developing\na highly successful career. These positive factors do not outweigh the potential for coercion generated\nby his vulnerability to coercion created by the presence of close family members in Iran, and his\ncontinued possession of a an Iranian passport. His equivocal statements regarding whether he would\nuse the Iranian passport to travel to Iran in the future was particularly problematic. Clearance is\ndenied. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 - Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 \u2013 Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nMarc E. Curry\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 37 years old, began working for her current employer in November 2005. She has received salary increases and promotions since her hire, and is presently a customer service technical assistant. She is seeking a position of public trust. Applicant has a 17-year-old daughter who lives with her. The SOR alleges financial considerations (Guideline F) based on 10 delinquent debts totaling approximately $24,714.00. The debts represent a broken lease, past due credit card accounts, and two overdue personal loans. Applicant admitted all the debts. The debts became delinquent between 2001 and 2005.

Petrie, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Public Trust Position Application (PTP), on December\n22, 2005. On July 31, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F\n(financial considerations) for Applicant. The action was taken pursuant to Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990),\nas amended, Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R (Jan. 1987), as amended\n(Regulation), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for an SOR\nissued on or after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR through her attorney on August 27,\n2007. She answered the SOR in writing September 4, 2007, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge. A Notice of Hearing was mailed to Applicant on\nNovember 8, 2007, and a hearing was held on November 26, 2007. The government\noffered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, which were received in evidence. Applicant testified\nJanuary 17,2008\n\n2\non her own behalf and submitted Exhibit (AE A). AE B, a character statement signed on\nAugust 21, 2007 by the manager of customer service, and customer service, was also\nadmitted in evidence. Two witnesses testified for Applicant. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 4, 2007. Based upon a review of the case\nfile, the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to a sensitive position is\ndenied. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant, 37 years old, began working for her current employer in November\n2005. She has received salary increases and promotions since her hire, and is\npresently a customer service technical assistant. She is seeking a position of public\ntrust. Applicant has a 17-year-old daughter who lives with her. \nThe SOR alleges financial considerations (Guideline F) based on 10 delinquent\ndebts totaling approximately $24,714.00. The debts represent a broken lease, past due\ncredit card accounts, and two overdue personal loans. Applicant admitted all the debts.\nThe debts became delinquent between 2001 and 2005. She filed a Chapter 7\nbankruptcy petition in September 2007, including the 10 creditors listed in the SOR. The\n10 creditors and nine additional creditors are listed in Schedule F of the petition. The\ntotal liability for listed in the petition for secured and unsecured creditors is $75,781.00.\nShe expects to receive her discharge in January 2008. \nApplicant was interviewed in June 2006 (GE 5), and provided several reasons for\nher financial problems. Living from paycheck to paycheck without having a budget in\nplace led Applicant to exercise poor judgment over the years, and not live within her\nmeans. Examples of living beyond her means occurred in 1999 and 2000 when she was\npaying $800.00 a month in rent, and driving a sports car with exorbitant insurance\npremiums. \nShe explained to the investigator in June 2006 that her plan had been to repay\nthe creditors one at a time while ignoring the others. She announced she would contact\nthe creditors and establish some kind of repayment agreement with them. Though she\nhad no reason why she did not attempt to contact the creditors earlier, she conceded\nshe was afraid to make contact with them. \nThough the impact of her unemployment was not addressed in her June 2006\ninterview, Applicant explained at the hearing that her six months of unemployment in\nearly 2001 contributed dramatically to her financial problems. When she resumed\nemployment in July 2001, she had to forego credit card payments and recover on her\noverdue car payments while repaying friends she had borrowed money from. Except for\nher periods of unemployment in 2001 and between August and November 2005,\nApplicant knew of no major events or serious health conditions that prevented her from\npaying her debts. \n\n3\nIn her June 2006 interview, Applicant stated her net monthly earnings to be\n$1,746.00 a month. After paying all her expenses, excluding the debts listed in the\nSOR, Applicant\u2019s net monthly remainder was $83.00 in June 2006. According to her\nChapter 7 bankruptcy petition (GE 8) filed in September 2007, her estimated monthly\nremainder was $13.86. \nThe debts shall be discussed in the order they appear in the SOR. \n\u008e 1.a. Applicant owes $1,555.00 to a collection agency for breaking a lease in\nAugust 2005. She vacated the property shortly after she was fired from her job with the\ncommunications company for not informing them why she was taking personal leave.\nShe knew she had to inform the company the reason(s) for taking leave. Though she\nwas aware of the penalty for violating the lease, the landlord did not inform her of an\nintention to impose the two-month penalty. Applicant has made no attempts to settle the\nmatter.\n\u008e 1.b. The credit card account ($3,924.00 as of July 2007) was opened in\nDecember 2000. The account became delinquent when Applicant lost her job in late\nDecember 2000 or early January 2001. When she resumed working again in July 2001,\nshe concentrated her attention on more pressing expenses such as her car payment\nand car insurance. \n\u008e 1.c. The credit card account (currently $6,014.00) was opened in 1999 while\nApplicant was still employed at her relative\u2019s rehabilitation facility. She has made no\ncontact or payment on the account.\n\u008e 1.d. The credit card account (currently at $2,819.00) was placed into collection\nin November 2004. \n\u008e 1.e. The past due account (currently at $1,289.00) was opened by Applicant in\n1993 for catalogue purchases. Applicant surmised she stopped making payments on\nthe account in 2003. \n\u008e 1.f. A national discount store is the original creditor on this account. The\ncorrect amount is $3,869.00, as indicated in the Schedule F list in her bankruptcy\npetition (GE 8; AE A).\n\u008e 1.g. Applicant opened up this credit card account in October 2003. On April 24,\n2007, Applicant was mailed a settlement agreement by the collection agency to settle\nthe account. The agreement was for Applicant to make 14 payments of $58.60 every\ntwo weeks (a total of $820.40) until all payments have been paid. Then, the collection\nagency would release her from responsibility. Applicant maintains she made several\npayments, but only one documented payment (April 23, 2007) appears attached to GE\n6. After the account was transferred to another collection agency, Applicant made no\nadditional payments. Subtracting $58.55 from $878.06 (the balance quoted on the April\n24, 2007 proposed settlement letter) leaves a new balance of approximately $816.00. \n\n4\n\u008e 1.h. This account (currently at $982.00) is a credit card that Applicant stated\nduring her interview in June 2006 she may have paid off. The account is listed in her\nChapter 7 petition. \n\u008e 1.i., 1.j. The two accounts (currently totaling $6,256.00) represent loans\nApplicant opened in 2001 and 2002 to repay other debts. \nApplicant completed an online, three and a half-hour financial course in\nNovember 2007. The course helped her understand how a person sinks into financial\nproblems, and how to balance a budget. She stated that she started utilizing a budget\nafter she filed bankruptcy in September 2007. She monitors/revises the budget every\ntwo weeks to make certain she is not overextending herself. She also attended a\nfinancial seminar sponsored by her previous employer three years ago to determine\nwhether she should file bankruptcy. \nWitness one has known Applicant for 19 years, having lived with her occasionally\nin that period. Recently, Applicant has been living with him since October 2005, paying\nhim $400.00 a month in rent. While he knows about Applicant\u2019s debts, they do not\ndiscuss the subject. She has always talked about a budget, but he has never seen the\nbudget. \nWitness two is a businesswoman with two businesses in the local area. She has\nknown Applicant since 1990, and has discussed their respective financial difficulties.\nApplicant never asked witness two for help in formulating a budget. \nAccording to the character statement from the supervisor and manager of\ncustomer services, Applicant has been recognized for her work commitment. Her job\nperformance supports their recommendation that she merits employment in a public\ntrust position. \nPolicies\nBy memorandum dated November 19, 2004, the Deputy Under Secretary of\nDefense for Counterintelligence and Security directed DOHA to resolve all contractor\ncases submitted for trustworthiness determinations, including ADP I, ADP II, and ADP\nIII, under Directive 5220.6. When evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust\nposition, the Administrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nuseful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for employment in a public trust position. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s primary\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\n5\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nFinancial Considerations (FC)\nThe Concern. Failure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and meet financial\nobligations may indicate a lack of self-control, poor judgment, or unwillingness to abide\nby rules and regulations. \nAnalysis\nThe financial considerations guideline contains several disqualifying conditions\n(DC) that could raise security concerns. The three DCs that are applicable here are FC\nDC 19.a. \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d 19.c. \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations,\u201d and 19.e. \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may\nbe indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d FC DC 19.a. and 19.c. apply because\nApplicant accumulated more than $24,700.00 in delinquent debts over a seven-year\nperiod, and has taken almost no action until recently to resolve any of the debts. FC\n19.e. applies based on Applicant\u2019s recognition that there were times in her life she was\nliving beyond her means. \nAll the mitigating conditions (MC) under the FC guideline have been considered.\nFC MC 20.b. \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment\u201d is inapplicable. Applicant\u2019s\nindebtedness began at the end of December 2000 when she abruptly lost her job and\nwas unemployed, until she landed a job in July 2001 at the telephone company. Though\nshe was employed for the next four years, Applicant continued to open new credit\naccounts that later became delinquent when she could not meet the monthly payments.\n\n6\nThe recency of her poor judgment in creating new debt without addressing the old debt\nrenders FC MC 20.a. inapplicable.\nFC MC 20.b. applies when \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control and the individual has acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances.\u201d As the condition notes, unanticipated unemployment is clearly an\neconomic event beyond a person\u2019s control that entitles the person (after she resumes\nemployment) a reasonable period of time to adjust her financial practices to absorb the\ndisruption associated with a loss of earnings. As time passes however, the amount of\nmitigation decreases because the person has resumed employment, and is in a more\nviable position to handle the debts. When Applicant lost her job in late 2000, she was\nentitled to substantial mitigation. However, she still had an obligation to the remainder of\nher creditors to at least advise them of her predicament and/or work out some sort of\narrangement with them if she could. Instead, Applicant chose not to contact them\nbecause she was afraid. She is entitled to only limited credit under FC MC 20.b.\nBecause her unemployment in August 2005 was caused by her own poor judgment, she\nreceives no mitigation under FC MC 20.b. \nFC MC 20.c. \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nwill recognize a person\u2019s bona fide efforts to understand their financial problems and\nattempts to regain control over their financial obligations. Applicant\u2019s passing reference\nto a seminar three years ago does not carry much weight because of the passage of\ntime, and the lack of evidence describing the contents of the seminar. Applicant\u2019s online\nexperience has more probative value because she discussed critical financial issues\nsuch as the reasons for debt and balancing a budget. Applicant receives limited\nmitigation overall under this condition because she has only been utilizing a budget\nsince she filed her Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in September 2007 and she provided\nno documented evidence of the budget. \nFC MC 20.d. \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts\u201d refers to payment of creditors individually or under some\nkind of private or court plan. Where the evidence reflects sustained payments over a\nsignificant period of time to all listed creditors, then an applicant is entitled to substantial\nmitigation. However, the focus must turn to \u201cotherwise resolve debts\u201d of the condition\nsince Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. Discharging one\u2019s debts under\nChapter 7 is a legitimate option to eliminate delinquent debts and allow the debtor a\nfresh start in managing new financial obligations and responsibilities. Assuming the\ndebts are discharged in January 2008, Applicant\u2019s lengthy period of financial\nmismanagement requires a sustained period of financial responsibility that has not been\nestablished. Applicant\u2019s favorable job performance evidence has been considered. The\nlimited mitigation Applicant receives under FC MC 20.b. MC 20.c., and MC 20.d. is\ninsufficient to overcome the adverse evidence under the financial considerations\nguideline. \n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and the circumstances. The whole person concept consists of nine factors that\nshould be considered along with the specific guidelines. Those factors include: (1) the\nnature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which the participation was\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Applicant\u2019s\nhistory of financial problems raises trustworthiness concerns. She was 31 years old\nwhen her debts began falling delinquent. Her actions in failing to address her debts\nwere knowledgeable and voluntary. In June 2006, Applicant was put on official notice\nthat her past due debts were a concern to the government, and she indicated she would\ncontact the creditors and address the debts. Yet, the only creditor she contacted and\nnegotiated a settlement with was the 1.g. creditor in April 2007. Unfortunately, she could\nnot maintain the settlement terms after one payment. Considering the evidence as a\nwhole, Applicant\u2019s September 2007 bankruptcy filing, her financial counseling in\nNovember 2007, and her recent implementation of a budget is insufficient to meet her\nultimate burden of persuasion under the financial considerations guideline. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition. Eligibility for access to a sensitive position is denied. \n                      \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On July 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under\nGuideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of\nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as\namended (Regulation); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on August 29, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nOctober 11, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 24, 2007, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on November 15, 2007, in Sacramento, California.\nThe government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 7, which were received without\nJanuary 14, 2008\n\n2\nobjection.  Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through P,\nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 3,\n2007. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to sensitive information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges concern under Adjudicative Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations) of the Directive. The SOR contains 22 allegations, 1.a.,\nthrough 1.v., under Guideline F. In her RSOR, Applicant admitted SOR\nallegations1.b.,1.c.,1.d., 1.i. through 1.k., 1.n. through 1.t. and 1.v.  She also admitted\nthat a debt was owed , but did not agree with the amount stated in the SOR for the\nfollowing debts: 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., and 1.u. She denied allegations 1.a., 1.l., and 1.m.,\nThe admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the live testimony, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 39 years old. She is not married, and she has three children, ages\n19, 15, and 11, all of whom live with her.   Applicant is a customer Service\nRepresentative for a defense contractor who seeks an ADP-I/II/III position on behalf of\nthe Applicant.  \nThe SOR lists 22 allegations of overdue debts, 1.a. through 1.v., under\nAdjudicative Guideline F. All of the debts will be discussed in the same order as they\nwere listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $300.\nApplicant denies that she ever purchased anything from this creditor. She has disputed\nthis bill for some time. Exhibit D, is a letter, dated October 21, 2007, sent to the\ncollection agency for this creditor in which Applicant disputes this bill.  Since this bill is\nnot on the latest credit report I find that Applicant does not owe this debt.\n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $482.\nApplicant testified that Applicant\u2019s ex-husband had verbally agreed to pay this debt, but\nhe never did. She has now contacted this creditor and made one payment of $25, and\nshe plans to make payments of $100 a month until this debt is paid. \n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $215.\nApplicant is disputing this bill since she believes that it has been paid. Although the\ncreditor indicated that one of the bills has been paid, since there are apparently two bills\nfrom this creditor it is not clear if this entire debt has been resolved. \n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $212.\nApplicant testified that Applicant\u2019s ex-husband had verbally agreed to pay this debt for\nhis telephone, but he never did. She is not clear which of two collection agencies is\n\n3\nresponsible for collecting this debt. She testified that when she becomes aware of the\nproper party, she will pay this bill. \n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,169.\nApplicant testified that this debt is for child support which she has paid for her daughter,\nwho is now 19 years of age. She has been having $94 a month garnished from her\nwages, and she believes she now owes approximately $590 on this debt. \n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,378.\nApplicant testified that this credit card debt became overdue when her husband at the\ntime became unemployed. She stated that the actual debt was no more than her credit\nlimit of $500 on this card and she attempted to negotiate a payment plan to resolve this\ndebt when it was first overdue, but was unable to do so. Through interest and finance\ncharges the bill has increased to the current amount stated on the SOR, and it has not\nbeen resolved.\n1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,659.\nApplicant testified that this credit card debt also became overdue when her husband at\nthe time became unemployed. The actual debt was no more than her credit limit of\n$250 on this card, but again, she was unable to negotiate a payment plan to resolve\nthis debt. Through interest and finance charges the bill has increased to the current\namount stated on the SOR, and it has not been resolved.\n1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 8 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $801.\nApplicant testified that this third credit card debt became overdue when her husband at\nthe time became unemployed. The actual debt was no more than her credit limit of\n$500 on this card, but again, she was unable to negotiate a payment plan to resolve\nthis debt Through interest and finance charges the bill has increased to the current\namount stated on the SOR, and it has not been resolved.\n1.i. This overdue debt to Creditor 9 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $121.\nApplicant testified that this debt is for a check with insufficient funds that was used to\nmake a payment to a creditor. She is disputing the amount that the collecting law firm is\nassessing for this insufficient check, although Applicant has no evidence that the\nassessment is incorrect. At this point this debt has not been paid.  \n1.j. This overdue debt to Creditor 10 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $127.\nThis debt is also for a check with insufficient funds that was used to make a payment to\na creditor. She is disputing the amount that the collecting law firm is assessing for this\ninsufficient check, although Applicant has no evidence that the assessment is incorrect.\nAt this point this debt has not been paid.  \n1.k. This overdue debt to Creditor 11 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $200.\nThis debt is also for a check with insufficient funds that was used to make a payment to\na creditor. She is disputing the amount that the collecting law firm is assessing for this\ninsufficient check, although Applicant has no evidence that the assessment is incorrect.\nAt this point this debt has not been paid.  \n\n4\n1.l. This overdue debt to Creditor 12 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $441.\nApplicant testified that this medical bill was not submitted to her insurance carrier as it\nshould have been. Exhibit F is a letter from the creditor hospital, dated November  12,\n2007, indicating that they acknowledge that this debt should have been billed to\nApplicant\u2019s insurance carrier, and that they are now reducing this debt to $0.\n1.m. This overdue debt to Creditor 13 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $190.\nThis medical bill was also not submitted to Applicant\u2019s insurance carrier as it should\nhave been. Exhibit F, the letter from the creditor hospital, indicates that they\nacknowledge that this debt should have been billed to Applicant\u2019s insurance carrier, and\nthat they are now reducing this debt to $0.\n1.n. This overdue debt to Creditor 14 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $260.\nApplicant testified that she has reached an agreement with this creditor, and she will be\npaying this debt in full by the end of November 2007. \n1.o. This overdue debt to Creditor 15 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $56.\nApplicant testified that she has reached an agreement with this creditor, and she will be\npaying this debt in full by the end of November 2007. \n1.p. This overdue debt to Creditor 16 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $105.\nApplicant testified that she has reached an agreement with this creditor, and she will be\npaying this debt in full by the end of November 2007. \n1.q. This overdue debt to Creditor 17 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $388.\nApplicant is unaware of the basis for this debt so she has contacted the creditor\nrequesting verification. \n1.r. This overdue debt to Creditor 18 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $140.\nApplicant testified that she has reached an agreement with this creditor, and she will be\npaying this debt in full by the end of November 2007. \n1.s. This overdue debt to Creditor 19 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $481.\nApplicant testified that she is current on this debt. Exhibit G shows that she makes\npayment of $61 on this debt and 1.t., below. \n1.t. This overdue debt to Creditor 20 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $3,719.\nApplicant testified that she is also current on this debt. Exhibit G shows that her\npayment of $61 is for this debt. \n1.u. This overdue debt to Creditor 21 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $414.\nApplicant is disputing this bill which she feels is incorrect. She has contacted the\ncreditor and the collection agency and received some documentation (Exhibit H), but it\ndoes not resolve Applicant\u2019s question of this debt.  She believes that she owes the\ncreditor $94 on this debt, and she has attempted to pay the creditor this amount, but\nthey would not accept it. \n\n5\n1.v. This overdue debt to Creditor 22 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $243.\nApplicant testified that this medical bill was not submitted to her insurance carrier as it\nshould have been. Exhibit F indicates that this debt should have been billed to\nApplicant\u2019s insurance carrier, and that they are now reducing this debt to $0.\nApplicant testified that over the last 15 years, with the exception of three years,\nshe was a single parent. Her primary financial problems occurred in 2003 when her\nhusband at the time, was involved in an automobile accident that resulted in a fatality\nand considerable legal bills. Ultimately he moved out, and their marriage was dissolved\nin 2004.  \nIn the last six months Applicant\u2019s financial situation has improved because she\nand her boyfriend are living together, along with her two children, and since he now\npays a third of the rent, $540, she now has more disposable income. Exhibit A is a\nPersonal Financial Statement prepared by Applicant. It shows a net remainder each\nmonth of $240.\nApplicant did purchase a 2004 Ford Mustang in 2005 for $19,000. She is making\npayments of $528 a month on the vehicle. \nFinally, Applicant submitted a 2006 and a partial 2007 performance evaluation\nfrom her current employer. They were both quite positive. \nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel\nare afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n6\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG & 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG & 19 (a), an Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG & 19 (c), a history of not meeting financial obligations\n\n7\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and was\nunable to pay some obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties.\nUnder AG & 20 (b), it may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. As noted above, some of\nthe financial problems arose from Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s fatal impact collision, his loss\nof employment and ultimately their dissolution of marriage. Applicant  acted responsibly\nin continuing to take care of her two children and in more recently identifying and\nattempting to resolve these debts. I find this potentially mitigating condition is a factor\nfor consideration in this case. \nSimilarly, AG & 20 (d) applies where the evidence shows the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. Applicant has\nbeen attempting to resolve all the delinquent debts, either by payment or settlement.\nShe is now more financially sound and better prepared for future contingencies. I\nconclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant\u2019s financial problems\nlargely resulted because she was a single parent for a number of years with a limited\nincome.  She also accumulated debt due to circumstances largely beyond her control.\nSignificantly, she has taken affirmative action to pay or resolve most of the delinquent\ndebts. Of course, the issue is not simply whether all her debts are paid. It is whether her\nfinancial circumstances raise concerns about her fitness to hold a position of public\n\n8\ntrust. I find that while some debts remain unpaid, they are insufficient to raise\ntrustworthiness concerns. \nOverall, the record evidence is favorable as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability\nfor a public trust position under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: \nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o.: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p.: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q.: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r.: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s.: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t.: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u.: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.v.: \nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition.

He also has failed to timely file income tax returns for many \nyears. Moreover, he made a false statement to a government investigator. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 13, 2004, Applicant submitted a security clearance application. On \nMay 21, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as modified and \nDecember 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \nrevised.1 The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The SOR \ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under \nthe Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him, and it recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked. \n \nOn July 1, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 12, \n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 26, 2009. The hearing was convened \nas scheduled on September 14, 2009. The government offered Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 7, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 and 2, which were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 18, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 2.a through \n2.e, and 3.a. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. He failed to address the allegation under \nSOR \u00b6 3.b, and I considered it denied. His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings \nof fact. \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old project manager working for a defense contractor. He \ngraduated from college in 1991, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English \nLiterature. He completed his master\u2019s degree (business management and computer \nscience) in 1995. He has never been married and has no children.  \n \nIn 1992, Applicant received an active duty officer commission in the U.S. Air \nForce. He achieved the rank of captain, and was honorably discharged in December \n2002. While in the service, Applicant held a top secret security clearance. His security \nclearance was continued when he was hired by a government contractor in September \n2004. Applicant has held access to classified information for approximately 17 years. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has ever failed to follow security procedures or that \nhe has compromised classified information. \n \nDuring 1997, Applicant consumed alcoholic beverages to excess. He attributed \nhis excessive consumption of alcohol to several events: the end of a four-year \nrelationship, a failing business that caused him to file for bankruptcy protection, and a \n \n1  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines in all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \npermanent change of duty station. Because of his failed business, Applicant filed for \nChapter 13 bankruptcy protection in October 1996. The bankruptcy was discharged in \nabout December 1996.2 \n \nIn 1997, Applicant realized he had a problem controlling his alcohol consumption \nand started to accept himself as an alcoholic. He was consuming a six pack of beer and \na bottle of wine frequently. Because of his concerns, Applicant voluntarily entered into a \n28-day impatient alcohol treatment program sponsored by the Air Force. He was \ndiagnosed as alcohol dependent and suffering from depression.  \n \nApplicant successfully completed his alcohol impatient treatment program. He \ncontinued his aftercare treatment and participated in group therapy once a week for one \nyear. During that same year, he attended approximately 100 Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) \nmeetings. Applicant testified he completed the AA 12-step process and continued \nattending AA regularly until 2001. He was abstinent from 1998 to 2005. \n \nApplicant has been living with his girlfriend since 2003. However, he anticipates \nhe will have to move out soon. Applicant has been treated for depression since around \n1996. During 2004, Applicant was treated for depression at a Veterans Administration \nmedical center and placed on medication. He is currently not taking antidepressants. \nApplicant and his doctor mutually agreed to stop the medications on a trial basis. \nApplicant believes he is doing well without the medications. Applicant informed his \ndoctors that he started to consume alcoholic beverages again around 2005. The doctors \nadvised Applicant against consuming alcohol.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2004 medical records indicate he was considered an alcoholic in \nremission. He was diagnosed with depression and alcoholism (alcohol dependent). His \nprognosis was deferred. Applicant testified that he sought treatment in 2004 because of \ndepression problems and only received depression-related treatment. He denied \nreceiving any alcohol-related treatment. However, from about May 2005 to about \nOctober 2006, Applicant received psychiatric treatment, in part, for his use of alcohol. \n \nApplicant claimed that he currently consumes one drink a day or approximately \ntwo drinks three times a week. He only drinks socially. He considers himself to be a \nrecovering alcoholic and does not drink to the point of intoxication. Applicant is currently \nnot attending AA meetings because he moved from one state to another and lost the \nhabit of attending AA meetings. Applicant also believes he has heard AA\u2019s message \nsufficiently and does not need to continue attending AA meetings. He believes he has a \ngood handle on his personal situation. Applicant did not provide a current alcohol \ndiagnosis or prognosis. \n \n \n2  Since his 1996 bankruptcy, Applicant has repaired his financial situation. He is current on all of \nhis debts, has a high credit score, and has established a record of financial responsibility. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant noted that he has never had any legal problems or alcohol-related \nmisconduct on or off work. Applicant averred he always tries to do the right thing as \ndemonstrated by his volunteering for alcohol treatment in 1997, and seeking depression \ntreatment in 2004. He promised to resolve his tax problems with the assistance of his \naccountant, and to drink in moderation. \n \nIn August 2006, Applicant underwent a security clearance interview during which \nhe denied consuming alcoholic beverages since his 1997 alcohol-related treatment. \nDuring a second interview in June 2007, Applicant admitted he lied to the investigator \nduring his August 2006 interview (GE 6). He deliberately failed to disclose that he had \nstarted consuming alcoholic beverages in 2005.  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant expressed remorse for lying to the investigator. He \nunderstands the seriousness of the security clearance process and knows he should \nhave been honest and truthful with the investigator. He explained he was facing a \nstressful situation and had a momentary lapse of judgment. He averred he has been \nhonest and forthcoming to his doctors about his alcohol consumption (Tr. 33-34). \nApplicant considers himself to be trustworthy, honest, and reliable. He believes he has \nmatured and is now a different person. He is enjoying a good life and he believes he \nhas no reason to drink excessively. \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his state and federal income tax returns for tax years \n2004, 2005, and 2006. In 2007, he hired an accountant to assist him to resolve and stay \non track with his taxes. He filed his state and federal income tax returns for tax years \n2004, 2005, and 2006 in 2008. As of his hearing date, Applicant had not filed his state \nand federal income tax returns for tax years 2007 and 2008. He attributed his failure to \ntimely file his taxes to his procrastination and disorganization. He also believed it was \nokay for him not to timely file his tax returns because he knew he did not owe any taxes. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \n\n \n5 \n \n \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and \nshall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See \nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication that the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n  \nUnder Guideline G the government\u2019s concern is that excessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. AG \u00b6 21. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nThe government established its case under Guideline G by showing that on or \nabout 1997, Applicant consumed alcohol to excess. Both in 1997 and 2004, Applicant \nwas diagnosed with alcohol dependence and depression. He was abstinent from 1998 \nto 2005. Applicant relapsed in 2005, and has continued to drink alcoholic beverages to \npresent. Guideline G disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 22(d): \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified \nmedical processional of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence,\u201d AG \u00b6 22(e): \u201cevaluation \nof alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a \nstaff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program,\u201d and AG \u00b6 22(f): \u201crelapse after \ndiagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation \nprogram,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has ever been involved in any alcohol-related \nmisconduct. He has continued consuming alcohol after his diagnosis of alcohol \ndependence in 1997 and 2004, and against his doctors\u2019 advice. He intends to continue \nconsuming alcohol in the future.  \n \n  \nThere are four Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 23 \npotentially applicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);  \n \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \n  \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in this case, I find none of the \nGuideline G mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s initial diagnosis of alcohol \n\n \n7 \n \n \ndependence was in 1997. However, Applicant\u2019s alcohol dependence diagnosis was \naffirmed in 2004. Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption appears to be tied to his depression. \nHe consumed alcohol to excess around 1997 because of emotional and personal \nproblems. At his hearing, Applicant indicated he is going through emotional and \npersonal problems with his current girlfriend. Without a current diagnosis and prognosis \nconcerning his alcohol dependence and depression, Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence is \nnot sufficient to show it is unlikely his questionable behavior will recur. Under the \ncircumstances, Applicant\u2019s behavior raises questions about his reliability and judgment. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nApplicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 1996, because of financial \nproblems related to a failed business and the end of a four-year relationship. He also \nfailed to timely file his state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2004, 2005, \nand 2006. He filed his state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2004, 2005, \nand 2006 in 2008. As of his hearing date, Applicant had not filed his state and federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2007 and 2008. He attributed his failure to timely file his \ntaxes to his procrastination and disorganization. He also believed it was okay for him \nnot to timely file his tax return because he knew he did not owe any taxes. AG \u00b6 19(a): \n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(g): \u201cfailure to file annual federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns as required,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nConcerning the 1996 bankruptcy, Applicant established circumstances beyond \nhis control contributing to his inability to pay his debts, i.e., his failed business and the \nend of his four-year relationship. Applicant is current on his debts, has high credit \nscores, and is financially stable. Since 1996, he has established a track record of \nfinancial responsibility. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and (b) apply, but do not fully mitigate the \nfinancial considerations concerns.  \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file annual \nfederal and state income tax returns as required by law (AG \u00b6 19(g)). As of his hearing \nday, Applicant had not filed his 2007 and 2008 state and federal taxes because of his \nprocrastination and disorganization. His behavior is recent and frequent, and casts \ndoubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, judgment, and ability to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nIn August 2006, Applicant willfully lied to a government investigator to cover his \nalcohol relapse. He also failed to timely file his state and federal income tax returns for \ntax years 2004, 2005, and 2006. He filed his state and federal income tax returns for tax \nyears 2004, 2005, and 2006 in 2008. As of his hearing date, Applicant had not filed his \nstate and federal income tax returns for tax years 2007 and 2008.  \n \nHis falsification is material and triggers the applicability of disqualifying conditions \nAG \u00b6 16(b): \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant \nfacts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other \nofficial government representative,\u201d and AG \u00b6 16(e): \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment \nof information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \n\n \n9 \n \n \nmanipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect \nthe person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d His failure to timely file his \nstate and federal income tax returns also triggers the applicability of AG \u00b6 16(e). \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nAfter considering the above mitigating conditions, I find that none apply to the \nfacts of this case. Applicant\u2019s behavior is recent. His falsification constitutes a felony \noffense under 18 USC Section 1001, and it casts doubt on his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature and well-\neducated man. He honorably served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force for \napproximately 10 years, and has held access to classified information for approximately \n17 years. He has successfully worked for government contractors since 2004. There is \nno evidence he has ever compromised classified information or committed any security \nviolations. Nor is there evidence that he has been involved in any alcohol-related \nmisconduct on or off work. These factors show responsibility, good judgment, and \nmitigation. \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant was diagnosed with depression and alcohol \ndependence in 1997 and 2004. He successfully underwent alcohol rehabilitation in \n1997, and participated in aftercare treatment. He was abstinent from around 1998 to \n2005. His excessive alcohol consumption was related to personal and emotional \nproblems. In 2004-2005, Applicant required treatment for depression and shortly \nthereafter, he started consuming alcoholic beverages again. Notwithstanding his \ndiagnosis as alcohol dependent and his physicians\u2019 recommendations against his \nconsumption of alcohol, Applicant has continued to consume alcoholic beverages to the \nday of his hearing. Applicant failed to present a current diagnosis and prognosis \nconcerning his alcohol dependence. \n \n \nApplicant also failed to timely file annual federal and state income tax returns as \nrequired by law because of his procrastination and disorganization. Moreover, in August \n2006, Applicant willfully lied to a government investigator to cover his 2005 alcohol \nrelapse. \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nOn balance, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence is insufficient to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from his alcohol consumption, financial \nconsiderations, and personal conduct. Overall, the record evidence fails to convince me \nof Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a &1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c - 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.b - 2.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a - 3.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

On April 9, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 22, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Michael H.\nLeonard denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to\nthe Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board\naffirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nThe Judge made the following findings pertinent to the issues raised on appeal: After retiring\nfrom a 30-year career as an active duty military member, Applicant obtained employment with a\ndefense contractor.  He worked in Iraq from 2005 to 2006.  While there, he came into possession of\ntwo nine-millimeter pistols.  He did not purchase the firearms, but obtained them from an unknown\nmember of the U.S. military.  Applicant\u2019s possession of the firearms was wrongful because\npossession of privately-owned firearms was a prohibited activity in violation of a general order,\nwhich applied to Applicant in his capacity as a civilian serving with the U.S. armed forces while\nunder the operational control of the military command in Iraq.  While in Iraq, Applicant was\ninvolved in an incident while off-duty where he shot two Iraqi nationals with one of his weapons.\nApplicant and others in his party were approached by two Iraqis, one of whom displayed a pistol,\nand proceeded to pull back the pistol\u2019s slide and release it.  Applicant then withdrew his pistol and\nshot the armed Iraqi and then turned and shot the other Iraqi, who was able to flee on foot.  Applicant\nand his companions left the scene and returned to the U.S. embassy compound, where they went their\nseparate ways.  Applicant did not report the shooting to any civilian or military authority at the\nembassy.\nApplicant claims he reported the shooting to some Marines the next day at his workplace,\nbut he was unable to provide any corroborating information on that point.  Some months later, while\non a trip back to the U.S. to attend to some personal business, Applicant recounted the shooting\nincident informally to a fellow employee while at his company\u2019s headquarters.  The information was\npassed along to the company\u2019s management officials, who held a meeting with Applicant about the\nincident.  The company concluded that Applicant had been forthright and cooperative during the\ninterview.  The company placed Applicant on administrative leave with pay, and subsequently told\nhim he was being laid off.  He was given 30 days severance pay.  Applicant was subsequently\ninterviewed by other government agencies and gave detailed accounts of the shooting incident,\nmaintaining that he acted in self-defense.  During the course of these interviews, Applicant indicated\nthat he did not notify anyone the night of the shooting because \u201cnobody wanted to get anyone else\nin trouble.\u201d  Applicant also stated that if he thought he had committed a crime then he would have\nreported it, but he didn\u2019t think he had committed a crime.\nThe Judge concluded that, with regard to the possession of firearms, Applicant knew, or\nshould have known, that his actions were unlawful.  The Judge concluded that it was difficult to\nbelieve that Applicant was not briefed on the prohibited activities listed in the general order.  The\n\n3\nJudge also concluded that Applicant willfully withheld information about the serious shooting\nincident, despite numerous opportunities to report it.  The Judge concluded that given his\nbackground and experience, Applicant knew or should have known a full report to his employer or\nan appropriate U.S. authority was required for such a serious incident.  Applicant elected not to take\naction (other than the unofficial action of mentioning it to some of the Marines he worked with)\nbecause he was concerned about the potential for negative consequences to himself and others\ninvolved.  The Judge concluded that, taken together, Applicant\u2019s conduct amounts to inappropriate\nworkplace behavior that calls into question Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nThe Judge stated that he gave due consideration to Applicant\u2019s military career and civilian service\nin light of the whole-person concept, but any credit due him is not enough to overcome the security\nconcerns.       \nApplicant asserts that the Judge\u2019s decision is not supported by the evidence.  He points out\nthat he had an exemplary military career without a blemish on his record.  Applicant also contends\nthat he was not aware of the general order or its contents, and he had not been briefed concerning\nthe issue of privately-owned firearms.  He claims that he did not intentionally disregard any order\nand it was common knowledge and practice that contractor employees were carrying weapons in\norder to protect themselves.  Regarding the shooting incident, Applicant asserts that the only way\nthe government has any information regarding the shooting incident is from himself.  Applicant\nstates that he did, in fact, report the incident in a timely manner and to appropriate authorities, and\nat no time did he intentionally withhold any information concerning the incident.  Applicant\u2019s\narguments do not establish error.\nAfter a review of the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s conclusions are\nsustainable.  Applicant testified that he was aware of the general order and knew that his employer\ndid not favor private possession of handguns in Applicant\u2019s duty area in Iraq.  These facts undercut\nApplicant\u2019s assertion that his possession of the handguns was innocent and reasonably support the\nJudge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s actions constituted lack of judgment. Likewise, the Judge\u2019s\nconclusions that Applicant did not properly inform the authorities through official channels about\nhis involvement in the shooting of two Iraqi civilians and that his failure to do so constituted poor\njudgment and lack of trustworthiness are also supported by the record.\n \nAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the\nfavorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-\n10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He discussed the applicability of the mitigating factors listed under Guideline\nE, but indicated why those mitigating conditions could not be invoked in this case to alleviate the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.   \n\n4\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.

Sykstus, Esq.  \n                     \n           \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. The record shows\nApplicant, a retired Marine with 30 years of military service, wrongfully possessed two\nnine-millimeter pistols while working as a civilian employee of a Defense Department\ncontractor supporting the U.S. Armed Forces in Iraq in 2006. In addition, in January\n2006, he was involved in an incident where he shot two Iraqi nationals, although it\nappears his actions were in self-defense. Applicant did not report the shooting to his\nemployer or to an appropriate U.S. authority. The shooting incident was discovered in\nJune 2006, when his employer learned of it indirectly; the employer then reported it to\nthe Defense Department. In May 2008, a law-enforcement investigation determined\nthere was insufficient evidence to prove or disprove the death of an Iraqi national and\nthe aggravated assault of a second Iraqi national did or did not occur. Taken together,\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s wrongful possession of the\nFebruary 22, 2010\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to\nthis case. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. \n2\nfirearms and his failure to timely report the shooting incident to his employer or\nappropriate U.S. authorities raise unanswered questions about his suitability or fitness\nfor a security clearance. Accordingly, as explained below, this case is decided against\nApplicant.\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on April 9, 2009,\n1\nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of\nreasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a\ncomplaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guideline\nknown as Guideline E for personal conduct. The SOR also recommended that the case\nbe submitted to an administrative judge to decide whether or not to deny or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance. \nIn summary, the SOR alleges Applicant possessed firearms (two pistols) while\nworking as a civilian employee in Iraq during 2005\u20132006; he failed to report to\nappropriate authorities an incident in January 2006, when he shot two Iraqi nationals;\nand his subsequent departure from the company after the shooting incident became\nknown in June 2006. Also, the SOR alleges two other matters under personal conduct.\nFirst, it alleges Applicant had a son out of wedlock in 2004, and that his spouse is\nunaware of the child or Applicant\u2019s relationship with the child\u2019s mother. Second, it\nalleges Applicant has had an ongoing relationship with a woman in Thailand since about\n2001.   \nApplicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on September 1, 2009. The hearing took place October 29,\n2009. The transcript (Tr.) was received November 6, 2009.  \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a federal contractor. Before working as a\ncontractor, he served 30 years in the U.S. Marine Corps. He married for the first time in\n1980, and the marriage ended in divorce in 1985. He married his current wife in 1985. \nWhile on active military duty in 2001, Applicant established a relationship with a\nwoman he met while deployed in Thailand. He has since traveled to Thailand on\nmultiple occasions, usually once a year. Applicant maintains his relationship with the\nThai woman is not sexual, and that his wife is aware of this relationship. Applicant\n\n Exhibit 3. \n2\n Exhibit X. \n3\n Exhibit 3. \n4\n Exhibit C. \n5\n Exhibits E\u2013R. \n6\n Exhibits A, B, and D. \n7\n Exhibit 7. \n8\n3\nvoluntarily disclosed his relationship with the Thai woman during a background\ninvestigation in 2005.  His most recent visit to Thailand, during which he spent time with\n2\nthe Thai woman, was in October 2009, shortly before the hearing in this case. \nWhile on active military duty in 2004, Applicant had an affair with another woman\nin the U.S. resulting in a son being born. Applicant voluntarily pays child support for his\nson,  but he no longer has a relationship with the child\u2019s mother. Applicant\u2019s wife is\n3\nunaware of the affair or the child. Applicant volunteered this information during a\nbackground investigation in 2005.  He is willing to tell his wife about the affair and his\n4\nchild if necessary, but prefers not to do so as he does not want to hurt his wife.\nApplicant\u2019s service in the Marine Corps ended in February 2005, when he retired\nat the highest enlisted grade of master gunnery sergeant (pay grade E-9).  He served,\n5\nwith distinction, in multiple positions of increasing responsibility in his primary specialty\nof field artillery. His fitness reports and other official documents show that Applicant had\nan outstanding career in the Marine Corps.  He continues to be an excellent duty\n6\nperformer, as shown by two recent performance appraisals and a letter of\nrecommendation from a Special Forces officer who has oversight responsibilities for\nApplicant\u2019s current employment in Afghanistan.  \n7\nAfter his retirement, Applicant obtained employment with a defense contractor.\nHe then worked in Iraq from about June 2005 to June 2006 to support a program on\nbehalf of his employer. While there, Applicant came into possession of two nine-\nmillimeter pistols. He did not purchase the firearms, but obtained them from an unknown\nmember of the U.S. Armed Forces. Applicant believes the Marine unit he supported\nknew he had firearms, as Applicant reports the unit provided ammunition to him.  \nApplicant\u2019s possession of the firearms was wrongful because possession of\nprivately-owned firearms was a prohibited activity in violation of a General Order (GO),\nissued by the Commanding General of the Multi-National Corps \u2013 Iraq, in February\n2005.  The GO applied to Applicant in his capacity as a civilian serving with, employed\n8\nby, or accompanying the U.S. Armed Forces while under the operational control of the\ncommand and present for duty in Iraq or Kuwait. The GO is a punitive order, meaning\n\n Exhibit 5. \n9\n Exhibit 2. \n10\n4\nthat a civilian could face criminal prosecution or adverse administrative action for\nviolating the GO. \nApplicant was working in Baghdad for a short time in about January 2006, when\nhe was involved in an incident where he shot two Iraqi nationals. The incident took place\nwhen Applicant and two other individuals were on an evening sightseeing trip in\nBaghdad. The group stopped the vehicle they were traveling in and got out to look\naround. A young Iraqi man then approached the group and had a conversation with the\ndriver of the vehicle. During the conversation, the Iraqi displayed a pistol and at the\nsame time another Iraqi man approached the group from the rear. At some point, the\narmed Iraqi pulled back the pistol\u2019s slide and released it. In turn, Applicant withdrew his\npistol and shot the armed Iraqi who fell to the ground and appeared to be dead.\nApplicant then turned and shot the second Iraqi who was able to flee on foot.  \nApplicant and the others in the group left the scene and returned to the U.S.\nEmbassy compound in Baghdad where they went their separate ways. Applicant did not\nreport the shooting to any civilian or military authority at the Embassy. The next day\nApplicant left the Embassy compound and returned to the camp where he was normally\nassigned. Applicant says he reported the shooting to some Marines he worked with at\nthe camp, but he was unable to provide any corroborating information on that point.  \nIn June 2006, Applicant returned to the U.S. to take care of some personal\nbusiness. While at his company\u2019s headquarters, Applicant recounted the shooting\nincident informally to another employee. The information was passed along to the\ncompany\u2019s management officials who held a meeting to question Applicant about the\nincident. In doing so, the company concluded Applicant was forthright and cooperative\nduring the interview. The company placed Applicant on administrative leave with pay.\nThe company subsequently told Applicant he was being laid off and given 30 days of\nseverance pay. On June 23, 2006, the company submitted to the Defense Department\nan adverse information report concerning the incident.  \n9\nThe following month, Applicant found new employment with another defense\ncontractor. He has worked for this company, or its successor in interest, since then, and\nhe is currently working in Afghanistan. \nAs a result of the adverse information report, Applicant was interviewed by an\nauthorized investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in\nJanuary 2007. Applicant gave a detailed account of the shooting incident to the OPM\ninvestigator in which he described shooting the Iraqis in self-defense.10\nThereafter, the shooting incident was reported to the Defense Criminal\nInvestigative Service, which forwarded the matter to the U.S. Army Criminal\n\n Exhibit 4. \n11\n Exhibit 4 at 16.\n12\n Exhibit 4 at 17. \n13\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to\n14\na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n15\n5\nInvestigation Command (CID) in about April 2007. The Army CID undertook a criminal\ninvestigation and completed its report of investigation in May 2008.  During the criminal\n11\ninvestigation, Applicant provided a ten-page written statement in May 2007, describing\nthe shooting and responding to various questions. The statement was provided after\nApplicant was advised of his rights and waived the same. This statement is like the\nothers in that Applicant described a scenario where he acted in self-defense. Asked if\nhe notified anyone of the shooting, he replied: \nNot that night. Nobody wanted to get anyone else in trouble and when I\ngot back to [the camp] the usual questions came up and I told them. I am\nnot sure if they believed me or not. They did not say they did not believe\nme. It seemed as if it did not matter.  \n12\nLater in his written statement he said that, \u201cIf I thought I had committed a crime then I\nwould have reported the crime but I don\u2019t feel that I committed a crime.\u201d  \n13\nIn summary, the Army CID investigation concluded with a determination that\nthere was insufficient evidence to prove or disprove the death of an Iraqi national and\nthe aggravated assault of a second Iraqi national did or did not occur. In other words,\nthe investigation could not substantiate or refute that the offenses occurred. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n14\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n15\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  \n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n16\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n17\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n18\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n19\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n20\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n21\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n22\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n23\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n24\n6\nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n16\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n17\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n18\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n19\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n20\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n21\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.22\nThe Agency\u2019s appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.23\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n24\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 15.\n25\n Exhibits S, T, and U. \n26\n7\nAnalysis\nGuideline E includes issues of false statements and credible adverse information\nthat may not be enough to support action under any other guideline. In particular,\nsecurity concerns may arise due to:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n25\nAlthough the SOR alleges five different matters under Guideline E, this case\ninvolves two main issues. The first is whether Applicant\u2019s relationships with women\nother than his wife pose undue security concerns. The second is whether Applicant\u2019s\nwrongful possession and use of firearms in Iraq in 2006, and his failure to timely report\nthe shooting incident to his employer or appropriate U.S. authorities, pose undue\nsecurity concerns.  \nThe first issue is resolved for Applicant. Although it appears that Applicant has an\nunconventional marriage and is withholding information from his spouse, his\nrelationships with other women do not rise to the level of undue security concerns. The\naffair terminated and Applicant\u2019s contact consists of making monthly child-support\npayments, for which he is commended. Also, we would not know about the affair or the\nchild but for Applicant\u2019s willingness to disclose this information during his background\ninvestigation in 2005. The same can be said of Applicant\u2019s long-term and ongoing\nrelationship with the Thai woman, because we know about it only because Applicant\ndisclosed it during the 2005 background investigation. Given his willingness to disclose\nthese matters of a highly personal nature, they do not create a vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress in a security-clearance context. Accordingly, SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e are decided for Applicant. \nThe second issue is resolved against Applicant. In broad terms, it concerns\nApplicant\u2019s workplace conduct, albeit in a war zone where the threat to life and limb was\npresent,  as follows: (1) his wrongful possession of two firearms while employed by a\n26\nDefense Department contractor in Iraq; and (2) his failure to timely report the January\n2006 shooting incident to his employer or an appropriate U.S. authority. The record\nshows Applicant engaged in activity that he knew or should have known was unlawful\nby possessing two firearms while a civilian employee in a war zone. Indeed, it is\ncommon for incoming personnel to receive briefings on multiple subjects when\ndeploying in support of U.S. Armed Forces. It is difficult to imagine Applicant was not\n\n Exhibit 7 at \u00b6 2.a. \n27\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d).\n28\n8\nbriefed on the prohibited activities of the GO, the first of which addressed the issue of\nprivately-owned firearms.  \n27\nAlso, the record shows Applicant was willing to withhold information about a\nserious incident when he failed to timely report the January 2006 shooting to his\nemployer or an appropriate U.S. authority. Applicant had several opportunities to report\nwhen the incident was still fresh. For example, he could have reported it to civilian or\nmilitary officials at the Embassy when he returned there after the shooting. Likewise, he\ncould have reported it the next day, again at the Embassy, or to his employer via e-mail\nor another communication method. Instead, Applicant, at best, mentioned it to some of\nthe Marines he worked with when he returned to his camp. Again, given his background\nand experience, he knew or should have known a full report to his employer or an\nappropriate U.S. authority was required for such a serious incident. Instead, he elected\nto take no action (other than mentioning it to some of the Marines he worked with)\nbecause he was concerned about the potential for negative consequences to himself or\nothers involved. Taken together, the totality of facts and circumstances raise two\ndisqualifying conditions, as it amounts to inappropriate workplace behavior that calls into\nquestion Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \n28\n \nAll of the mitigating conditions under \u00b6 17 of Guideline E were considered and\nnone, individually or in combination, are sufficient to mitigate the security concerns.\nAccordingly, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, as related to the workplace matters, are decided\nagainst Applicant. And SOR \u00b6 1.c, as related to the workplace matters, is decided for\nApplicant because the allegation does not allege disqualifying conduct, it merely pleads\nproof by setting forth the employer\u2019s action in light of the January 2006 incident.\nPleading proof (in this case, the consequences of the underlying events) should be\ndiscouraged. \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate a\nperson\u2019s eligibility by considering the totality of the person\u2019s conduct and all the\ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine factors listed in the\nRevised Guidelines as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9). \n29\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 15.\n30\n9\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n29\nI gave due consideration to Applicant\u2019s case in light of the whole-person concept,\nand any credit due him is not enough to overcome the security concerns. In reaching\nthis conclusion, I gave substantial weight to Applicant\u2019s 30-year career in the Marine\nCorps, for which I have great respect. I also gave substantial weight to his willingness to\nserve in harm\u2019s way, in and out of uniform, on behalf of the U.S. And I gave substantial\nweight to the undisputed fact that Applicant was living and working in a dangerous place\n(Iraq during 2005\u20132006) where he likely felt the need to arm himself with a firearm.\nNevertheless, I took into account that the U.S. Armed Forces operate in a highly\nregulated way for reasons that go beyond the interests of a single individual. This\nregulation extends to dictating who may carry a firearm consistent with the principles of\nthe law of war. And it certainly extends to regulating the possession of privately-owned\nfirearms in a war zone.\nQuestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations are core policy concerns under the personal conduct\nguideline.  Here, the record demonstrates that Applicant possessed two firearms when\n30\nhe knew or should have known it was wrongful and contrary to the GO. And the record\ndemonstrates that Applicant did not report the January 2006 shooting incident to his\nemployer or an appropriate U.S. authority, because he was no doubt concerned about\nnegative consequences from the shooting or from his possession of the firearms or\nboth. Taken together, these matters raise unanswered questions about his judgment,\ncandor, honesty, or willingness to comply with rules and regulations. Following the\nprinciples of Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, those unanswered questions are\nresolved against Applicant. To conclude, Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.b: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c\u20131.e:\nFor Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.        \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom he has worked, with a security clearance, for 32 years. He and his wife of twenty years were divorced in December 2003. They have three children, ages 22, 19, and 15. (GE 1 at \u00a7\u00a7 2, 11, 13, 14(8-10).) In his original Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1, except for those listed in \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.l. The 11 debts to which he admitted total $105,115.38. Some of these debts became delinquent during each year from 2003 to 2006. They include a federal income tax debt of more than $18,000, toward which he is making monthly payments of $234, and a child support payment delinquency alleged in the amount of $71,477 that had increased to $75,353 by November 2007. His February 2008 credit bureau report (CBR) (GE 8.) showed an outstanding balance of $69,068 in delinquent child support with monthly payments by payroll deduction. He testified that he formerly paid $300 per month toward his tax debt, 3 but negotiated the lower amount because it was all he could afford. The only payment for which he submitted any evidence was one in February 2008. Neither a copy of his settlement agreement nor his current balance were provided despite a statement that he would do so. (AE C; AE D; Tr. at 44-47.) The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h resulted from the voluntary repossession of Applicant\u2019s former automobile. He was unclear about the details of this transaction, but recall",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant\u2019s has substantial delinquent debt that he cannot afford to repay. He\nfalsified information about his debts on his security clearance application. Based upon a\nthorough review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access\nto classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86), on\nOctober 20, 2005. On August 14, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns\nunder Guidelines F, E, and J. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \nJune 9, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 23, 2007. After being\ngranted an extension of time to respond, he answered the SOR in writing on October\n12, 2007, and requested a hearing before an administrative udge. On November 28,\n2007, DOHA informed Applicant that he had failed to admit or deny the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6\n2.a through 2.c of the SOR. Applicant responded again on January 17, addressing\nthose allegations but failing to formally admit or deny either the falsifications alleged in\nthose paragraphs or the criminal conduct aspect of them alleged by reference in SOR \u00b6\n3.a. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 25, 2008, and DOHA\nassigned the case to me on February 28, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 11, 2008, and Applicant\nacknowledged receiving it at least 15 days before the hearing. (Tr. at 12.) During a\nthree-way telephone conference with Applicant and Department Counsel on March 19,\n2008, I denied Applicant\u2019s verbal request for a 30-day continuance. He said he was\nscheduled to work on the day of the hearing, but would also be scheduled to work a\nmonth later, so he did not demonstrate good cause for the delay. He did not have\ndifficulty arranging the time off to attend the hearing, and was ready to proceed. (Tr. at\n16-17.)  I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 27, 2008. Department Counsel\noffered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9, which were admitted without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through\nE, which were admitted without objection. I granted  Applicant\u2019s request to leave the\nrecord open until April 10, 2008, in order for him to submit documentation supporting his\nclaims to have made some payment arrangements and paid some of the alleged debts.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 4, 2008. On April 7, 2008,\nApplicant submitted a note and copies of two pay record documents, one from each of\nhis jobs, to Department Counsel. He did not submit any further evidence, and\nDepartment Counsel forwarded Applicant\u2019s submission without objection to its\nconsideration on April 10, 2008. These documents were marked AE F, and the record\nwas closed.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom he has\nworked, with a security clearance, for 32 years. He and his wife of twenty years were\ndivorced in December 2003. They have three children, ages 22, 19, and 15. (GE 1 at \u00a7\u00a7\n2, 11, 13, 14(8-10).) \nIn his original Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the delinquent\ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1, except for those listed in \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.l. The 11 debts to\nwhich he admitted total $105,115.38. Some of these debts became delinquent during\neach year from 2003 to 2006. They include a federal income tax debt of more than\n$18,000, toward which he is making monthly payments of $234, and a child support\npayment delinquency alleged in the amount of $71,477 that had increased to $75,353\nby November 2007. His February 2008 credit bureau report (CBR) (GE 8.) showed an\noutstanding balance of $69,068 in delinquent child support with monthly payments by\npayroll deduction. He testified that he formerly paid $300 per month toward his tax debt,\n\n3\nbut negotiated the lower amount because it was all he could afford. The only payment\nfor which he submitted any evidence was one in February 2008. Neither a copy of his\nsettlement agreement nor his current balance were provided despite a statement that\nhe would do so. (AE C; AE D; Tr. at 44-47.) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h resulted from the voluntary repossession of\nApplicant\u2019s former automobile. He was unclear about the details of this transaction, but\nrecalled returning the vehicle to the dealer when he could not afford to make the\npayments. He testified that it was a used 1999 Chrysler Sebring convertible, and the\ndealer resold it soon after he turned it in. The record CBRs show that he borrowed\n$23,219 to buy the car in February 2002. On September 14, 2004, his CBR reported\nthat he was 60 days and two payments past due, in the amount of $1,679, with an\noutstanding loan balance of $21,541. (GE 2 at 1.) After the car sold, Applicant\u2019s\noutstanding balance due on the loan was $12,648, which was eventually charged off in\nJanuary 2005. (GE 3 at 2.) His reason for denying the debt in his Answer was that he\nwas trying to settle the matter with the lender, and he supplied no evidence of any\npayment toward the debt.\nApplicant claimed that he had paid the $384 delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l,\nand provided a copy of an offer to settle the debt for $230. (GE 6 at 21.) When\nquestioned about proof of payment, he said it had been a money order and he had a\nreceipt that he would provide. (Tr. at 57-59.) He did not provide any proof of payment,\nand his most recent CBR shows the debt as an unpaid collection item. (GE 8 at 1.)\nApplicant\u2019s second Answer discussed his resolution of the one debt that he had\nlisted as being delinquent more than 90 and 180 days in \u00a7 28 of his SF 86, but did not\naddress his failure to list any of his other debts that had been or were so delinquent at\nthat time. His September 2004 CBR reflects numerous delinquent debts that remained\ndelinquent on his January 2006 CBR, including about $44,000 in delinquent child\nsupport that grew to about $58,000 during that period. (GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 2.) These\ndebts should have been listed when he completed his SF 86 in October 2005. When\nspecifically asked, during the hearing, why he did not list the other delinquencies in \u00a7 28\nof his SF 86, he stated:\nWell, the reason why, because I thought I was meeting some of those\nobligations at the same - - at the time, you know. I was getting in contact\nwith the peoples [sic] and I was trying to make arrangements to pay them.\nSo it wasn\u2019t like I was trying to - - you know, I might have been delinquent\non them but it wasn\u2019t I was trying not to pay them.\n(Tr. at 62-63.) Applicant also responded \u201cNo\u201d to the question in \u00a7 27 of his SF 86 asking\nwhether any of his property had been repossessed during the past 7 years. He\nexplained in his second Answer and in testimony at the hearing that he did not reveal\nthe repossession of his car because he turned it in before it was repossessed and was\ntold it would not be reported as a repossession. (Answer, dated Jan. 17, 2008, at 1; Tr.\nat 59-61.)     \n\n4\nApplicant submitted a letter from his union president and another letter from his\ndepartment Chief, both attesting to his consistent and trustworthy performance of his\nresponsibilities. (AE A and B.) He also submitted a creditor list and proposed payment\nplan that was prepared for him by a credit counseling service and included eight debts\ntotaling $12,274. (AE E.) He testified that he had not implemented the proposed\nrepayment plan because his available assets are consumed by payments toward his\ndelinquent taxes and child support. (Tr. at 31, 36-37.) Finally, Applicant submitted pay\nrecords showing biweekly net pay of $851 for Applicant\u2019s main job, and $361 for his\nsecond job, which would average $2,626 per month. His gross biweekly pay from these\ntwo jobs is $3,662, but a combined $1,400 is deducted from that for court-ordered child\nsupport payments, in addition to other taxes and dues. (AE F.) In his personal financial\nstatement, he listed $2,870 in regular monthly expenses, not including debt repayments.\n(GE 6 at 16.) \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate\nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \n\n5\nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Of these nine different disqualifying conditions, the Government asserted\nthat two were raised by Applicant\u2019s financial circumstances (Tr. at 82.): \u201c(a) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nThe evidence shows that Applicant has incurred at least 13 outstanding, SOR-\nlisted delinquent debts totaling in excess of $118,000. His monthly net income falls\nabout $240 short of being sufficient to pay his reported regular living expenses, which\ndid not include any debt repayments. These debts became delinquent between 2003\nand 2006, with the only demonstrated repayment being small amounts going toward his\n$18,000 tax lien and roughly $70,000 in delinquent child support. Substantial security\nconcerns are raised under both AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The five\npotentially pertinent conditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\n\n6\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented roof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts arose during the last five years, and a substantial\nnumber and amount remain delinquent at present. His family budget is such that he\ndoes not have the means to repay them, and is likely to incur additional delinquent debt.\nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties to his divorce, but that was more than 5\nyears ago and his situation has steadily worsened. Applicant offered no evidence that\nhe followed the minimal financial counseling he sought, or that he has any\ncomprehensive plan to address his debt. He has not contacted most of his creditors to\narrange repayments despite statements of intent to do so. He said that he disputes the\namount claimed after his car was repossessed, but showed no evidence that he\nfollowed through with the creditor about that liability. There is no indication in this record\nthat his financial issues are either under control or likely to improve in the foreseeable\nfuture.\nThis evidence establishes minimal mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through (e).\nApplicant remains financially over-extended to a significant extent. He is well regarded\nat work, but that is insufficient to overcome other record evidence concerning his\ntrustworthiness, reliability and good judgment. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\n\n7\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The disqualifying condition alleged in the SOR and raised by the evidence\nin this case is:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nGiven his level of financial and legal sophistication, Applicant testified credibly\nthat he did not realize the voluntary surrender/repossession of his vehicle was a\nrepossession that would meet that definition as used in \u00a7 27 of his SF 86. Accordingly, I\nconclude that his omission of that information was not a deliberate attempt to conceal or\nfalsify relevant information. However, he obviously understood his obligation to report\ndelinquent debts under parts a and b of \u00a7 28, since he did list one small debt. He\nprovided no credible explanation for the omission of a very large number and level of\ndelinquent debt. Based on the evidence, including his demeanor and testimony, I\nconclude that he deliberately omitted that information in an attempt to conceal it and\ndeceive the Government about its existence. He has held a security clearance for\ndecades, and neither asserted nor demonstrated ignorance of the security significance\nof his financial situation.  \nTwo personal conduct mitigating conditions might apply to security concerns\nraised by this deliberate omission. AG \u00b6 17(a) (\u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith\nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with\nthe facts\u201d) does not apply in this case because Applicant made no effort to correct his\nomission of debt information. AG \u00b6 17(c) (\u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) also does not apply, since the falsification\noccurred on the security clearance application currently under adjudication and it\ncontinues to create doubt about his reliability and trustworthiness. Given his 5-year\nhistory of significant delinquent debt, his willingness to falsify his SF 86 about that\nsituation establishes significant concerns about his candor, judgment and willingness to\nfollow rules and regulations. On balance, any mitigating effect supported by Applicant\u2019s\nevidence is insufficient to overcome those concerns. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\n\n8\nrules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying, including: \u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses;\u201d and \u201c(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether\nthe person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\nstates: \n \n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter\nwithin the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the\nGovernment of the United States, knowingly and willfully--\n(1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a\nmaterial fact;\n(2) makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or\nrepresentation; or\n(3) makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to\ncontain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry;\nshall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years...\nApplicant\u2019s deliberate omission and concealment of his substantial delinquent\nindebtedness, as discussed above, constituted a violation of this statute. This, as a\nfelony, is a serious offense within the meaning of AG \u00b6 31(a), and does call into\nquestion Applicant\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nApplicant neither asserted nor introduced any evidence that would support application\nof any criminal conduct mitigating condition as set forth in AG \u00b6 32.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n9\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern involves substantial delinquent debts that he cannot afford to repay, and\nfalsification about those debts on his security clearance application. Applicant is a\nmature, experienced adult who is accountable for his decisions and conduct. His debts\narose over a lengthy period, and persist to date. There is ongoing potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation or duress since he remains financially overextended. \nApplicant\u2019s  good reputation at work and within his union is commendable, but\ninsufficient in itself to mitigate security concerns arising from his conduct. His\nfalsification concerning his debts took place on his present application for a clearance,\nand was done to conceal relevant negative information. His indebtedness is quite likely\nto continue in the foreseeable future. In light of his lengthy indebtedness and continuing\nfinancial over-extension, recurrence of attempts to conceal adverse matters was not\nshown to be unlikely.  \nOn balance, Applicant presented insufficient evidence to mitigate reliability and\ntrustworthiness security concerns arising from his failure to satisfy debts, history of not\nmeeting financial obligations, and falsification on his clearance application. Overall, the\nrecord evidence leaves substantial doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations, personal\nconduct, and criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\n           AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:                                 For Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:                                   Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:                                   Against Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:                       AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:                                   Against Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

HENRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJeff A. Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in 2003. He continues to maintain his Swedish citizenship\nand hold an active Swedish passport, which he uses for travel to Sweden. He declines to renounce\nhis Swedish citizenship or destroy, return, or otherwise invalidate his Swedish passport. Applicant\nhas not mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline C. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nThe Department of State Reports are: 1) Sweden, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2006; and 2)\n1\nBackground Note: Sweden, Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, August 2007.\nGovernment Exhibit 3 (Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, dated June 25, 2007) at 1.\n2\nId.\n3\nGovernment Exhibit 4 (Applicant\u2019s Security Application (S-86), dated March 31, 2006) at 1-3; Government\n4\nExhibit 5 (Interrogatories and answers, dated April 24, 2007) at 5.\n2\nOn May 23, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not\nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the SOR sets\nforth security concerns arising under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense,\neffective September 1, 2006. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge\nto determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. On June 25,\n2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations. He elected to have his case\ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and provided Applicant\nwith a complete copy on August 10, 2007. Applicant had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file\nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not submit a response\nor additional evidence. DOHA assigned this case to me on October 5, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nIn its submission of relevant material, the government has requested that I take administrative\nnotice of certain facts concerning Sweden based on information contain in two United States\nDepartment of State reports.  I hereby take notice of the information contained therein.\n1\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations under Guideline C, subparagraph 1.a.-1.d. of the SOR.2\nThose admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.  After a complete review of the evidence in\n3\nthe record and upon due consideration, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is 48 years old. When he completed his security clearance application in March\n2006, he listed his job as a field representative for a Department of Defense contractor in the aviation\nindustry. In his April 2007 response to the interrogatories, he indicated that he was again working\nfor an American air line carrier, but did not state when he began this employment. 4\n\nGovernment Exhibit 4, supra note 3, at 1-2, 5-6, 10-11.\n5\nId. at 3-4.\n6\nId. at 1, 5; Government Exhibit 5, supra note 3, at 2, 3, 5. The U.S. and European Union have not yet signed\n7\nan agreement on use of air space and airport landing rights.\nSee footnote 1.\n8\n3\nApplicant was born and raised in Sweden. He received a college degree in mechanical\nengineering in 1979 from a Swedish university. Upon graduation, he served in the Swedish Army\nfor less than a year. For the next eight years, he worked for Swedish companies. His parents are\ncitizens of and residents of Sweden.5\nApplicant married a U.S. born citizen in 1993. They own a house in the U.S. For at least the\nlast 10 years, Applicant has worked for American air line carriers in the U.S. as a pilot, or other\naviation companies as a mechanic or field representative.6\nThe United States (U.S.) granted Applicant citizenship in 2003. He still retains his Swedish\ncitizenship. He holds a Swedish passport issued in 2002 with an expiration date of 2012. Applicant\nalso holds a U.S. passport, issued in April 2003. He traveled to Sweden for pleasure in 2002, 2004\nand 2005, using his Swedish passport. He used his U.S. passport to travel to Iraq for business. He\ndeclines to destroy, surrender or invalidate his Swedish passport or renounce his Swedish citizenship.\nAs his explanation for this decision, he states that he works in the aviation industry, which\ntraditionally has unstable employment. When the \u201cOpen Sky\u201d agreement with Europe becomes\neffective, European air carriers will fly into the U.S. at will. Should he again be furloughed from his\ncurrent employment with an American airline carrier as a pilot, he wants the option to obtain\nemployment with European air carriers. With his Swedish passport, he could more readily find work\nwith a European air carrier, live in the U.S., and commute to work from his U.S. residence.7\nI take administrative notice of the following adjudicative facts from the U.S. Department of\nState reports submitted by the government. Sweden is a constitutional monarchy with a multiparty,\nparliamentary form of government. Legislative authority is vested in the unicameral parliament.\nElections are held every four years, and are free and fair. The king is the largely symbolic head of\nstate. The prime minister is the head of the government and exercises executive authority. The\ngovernment respects the human rights of its citizens. Swedish citizens enjoy many of the same\nfreedoms as American citizens, including freedom of speech, religion, press, and assembly. Sweden\nhas an independent judiciary and arrests are made based on warrants issued by duly authorized\nofficials. Sweden became a member of the European Union in 1995. Sweden and the U.S. have a\nclose and strong friendship, and work with each other on many issues. Sweden is a member of the\nUnited Nations and the NATO Partnership for Peace. Sweden\u2019s foreign policy is one of staying free\nof alliances in peace time so as to remain neutral in war. In 2002, Sweden revised its security\ndoctrine to allow for cooperation in response to threats against peace and security.8\nPOLICIES\n\nDirective, revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\n9\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd., July 11, 1997).\n10\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd., Dec. 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n11\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Instead, acknowledging the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines, are intended to assist the administrative judge in\nreaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. Although the presence or absence of a particular\ncondition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the revised AG should be\nfollowed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. In addition, each security\nclearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-\nperson concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent,\nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral\nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.9\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government\n10\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n11\npreponderance of the evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the\n12\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n13\nclearance decision.14\nNo one has a right to a security clearance,  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n15\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n16\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\n17\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an\nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and\n\nExecutive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n18\nMC \u00b6 11(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United states Government does not apply\n19\nto this case.\n5\npatriotism of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\n18\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\nThe Foreign Preference Guideline identifies the following security concern: When an\nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States,\nthen he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the\ninterests of the United States. (AG \u00b6 9)\nApplicant admitted the four Guideline C allegations in the SOR. Based on his admissions and\nthe facts in this case, a potential security concern arises under one Guideline C disqualifying\ncondition. Applicant retains his Swedish citizenship and holds an active Swedish passport, which\nhe uses when traveling to and inside Sweden. By using his Swedish passport for travel to Sweden\nafter becoming a U.S. citizen, he exercised a right and privilege of foreign citizenship. Thus,\nDisqualifying Condition (DC) \u00b6\u00b6 10(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member and\n10(a)(1) possession of a current foreign passport, a security concern is raised.\nUnder the potentially applicable Guideline C Mitigating Conditions (MC) , Applicant could\nmitigate security concerns by demonstrating that dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019\ncitizenship or birth in a foreign country (MC \u00b6 11(a)), the individual has expressed a willingness to\nrenounce dual citizenship (MC \u00b6 11(b)), exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign\ncitizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor\n(MC \u00b6 11(c)), use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security authority, (MC \u00b6\n11(d)), and the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or\notherwise invalidated (MC \u00b6 11(e)).19\nApplicant grew up in Sweden, his place of birth. After immigrating to the U.S. and becoming\na U.S. citizen, Applicant chose to maintain his citizenship with Sweden and to exercise his rights\nof Swedish citizenship, including the right to possess and use of a valid Swedish passport. He\ndeclined to renounce his dual citizenship, destroy his Swedish passport, surrender his Swedish\npassport to the cognizant authorities, or otherwise invalidated this passport. Because his employment\nwith American airline carriers fluctuates, he has decided to retain his Swedish passport and\ncitizenship because both expand his ability to obtain employment with a European airline carrier,\nshould his current employer furlough him again. The evidence of record fails to reflect that his use\n\n6\nof his Swedish passport for personal travel has been approved by a cognizant security authority.\nConsequently, Applicant has not mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns.\nWhole Person Analysis\nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance decisions are\nnot intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past transgressions. Rather, the\nobjective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\ntrustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Thus, in reaching this decision, I\nhave considered the whole person concept in evaluating Appellant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in\nprotecting our national interests. \nApplicant is not involved with drugs nor does he have problems with his finances or\nexcessive alcohol use. He is married and owns property in the U.S. He lives a normal American life,\nwith one exception. He retains his Swedish citizenship. When he became a U.S. citizen, Applicant\nswore allegiance to the U.S. and no other country. By retaining his Swedish citizenship, his loyalties\nbecame divided between two countries. \nApplicant is unwilling to renounce his Swedish citizen and give up his Swedish passport. His\nsole reason for retaining Swedish citizenship and possession of a Swedish passport is economic.\nWhile his reasoning is clearly understandable because his chosen career does not provide job\nstability, this decision places Applicant in a precarious situation which could result in pressure,\ncoercion, duress, or exploitation by other governments seeking information from the United States.\nBecause he is not willing to abandon his ties to Sweden, he has not mitigated the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns. Accordingly, I find against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline C :\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-d: \nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 13, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\n\n2\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On November 27, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Erin C. Hogan\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did\nnot give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence which showed that his indebtedness\nhad resulted from circumstances beyond his control, that he had acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances and made a good faith effort to repay his overdue creditors, and that there are now\nclear indications that his financial problems are under control.  As part of his argument, Applicant\nnotes that the Judge\u2019s findings could have given a fuller explanation of Applicant\u2019s financial\ncircumstances.  Applicant also provides new evidence which indicates that since the hearing the\ntwelve delinquent accounts totaling approximately $56,729 have now been reduced to four\ndelinquent accounts  totaling approximately $7,300 of consumer debt and $15,343 of mortgage\nrelated debt.   Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred. \nThe Board may not consider new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Therefore,\nthe Board may not consider Applicant\u2019s efforts to reduce his outstanding indebtedness after the close\nof the record.  That evidence does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 06-00799 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 16, 2007). \nThe Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record unless she\nspecifically states otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08623 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 29, 2005).  She\nis not required to cite or discuss every piece of record evidence.  See, e.g, ISCR Case No. 04-01961\nat 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2007).  After reviewing the Judge\u2019s findings, the Board concludes that they\nare supported by \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support\nsuch a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  See\nalso Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).\n \nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant still owed approximately $56,729 on\n\n3\ntwelve delinquent accounts.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App.\nBd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nlength and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of\nrelevant conditions and factors.  She found in favor of Applicant as to some of the SOR allegations.\nHowever, she reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in\nmitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not\nreview a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that\nthe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision,\n\u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle\nMfrs.

Although Applicant has taken steps to resolve some of\nthe debts, his future financial situation remains questionable. He paid some debts by taking out a\n401k loan. He has not started to pay the mortgage foreclosure debt. Applicant's ability to repay all\nof his debtors on a timely basis is uncertain due to his recent history of failed repayment agreements.\nSecurity concerns raised under financial considerations remain.

There was a $786 account with a payday loan company. Applicant claims he took out this\n10\nloan in March 2005 for family member who did not make the payments on the account. As of the\nhearing, he had made no attempts to resolve this debt.  The other debt was an $125 overdue medical\n11\nbill for his son. The bill consists of co-payments between 2001-2005 which were not paid.  After the\n12\nhearing, Applicant indicated that he entered into payment agreements with both creditors.13\nApplicant claims that his financial problems began after September 11, 2001. He claims that\nthe economy of the state where he resided was hit hard.  He ended up with reduced hours on the job.\nHis hours went for 60 hours a week to 40 hours a week.  His salary was approximately $28,000 per\n14\nyear before September 11, 2001. It was reduced to approximately $22,000 after September 11, 2001.\nHis salary gradually increased to $45,000 per year prior to leaving his job.  Applicant incurred most\n15\nof the credit card debt during the time he was a single parent trying to complete his college degree.16\nIn 2005, Applicant was hired by his current employer for $56,000 a year. He currently earns $62,000\na year.  \n17\nApplicant's wife has worked \"off and on\" during their marriage. A month prior to the hearing,\nshe started a job and accepted a new job which starts a week after the hearing. She is going to work\n32 hours a week for $8 an hour.18\nIn 2003, Applicant borrowed $4,000 from his sister in order to help with expenses. He\nborrowed another $1,200 from his sister in January 2005. He borrowed $1,800 from his mother. He\nrepaid both loans in May 2007.19\n\n Tr. at 78. \n20\n Tr. at 41.\n21\n Tr. at 22, 41; AE C. \n22\n Tr. at 24; AE D. \n23\n Tr. at 24. \n24\n AE N at 16. \n25\n AE N at 18-19. \n26\n AE N at 4-11.\n27\n AE N at 3. \n28\n6\nIn 1999, Applicant purchased a house in the previous state where he resided. He started to get\nbehind the mortgage payments in 2002.  From 2002 to 2005, he struggled to keep current on his\nmortgage payments.   When he moved to his new location in February 2005, he knew he would be\n20\nunable to afford paying rent at his new location as well as the mortgage. In April 2005, he leased the\n21\nhouse to his daughter and three of her friends. The lease did not work out.  He unsuccessfully\n22\nattempted to sell his home.  On December 28, 2006, the house was foreclosed.  He intends to start\n23\n24\npayment arrangements pertaining to debt alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.k and 1.l in January 2008 once the\nforeclosure paperwork is finished pertaining to the mortgage debt.  The Veterans Administration (VA)\nis currently finishing the payment process on the claim for the VA guaranteed loan.25\nApplicant's current annual salary is $62,000. Applicant's most recent budget lists a total net\nmonthly income as $4,500; total monthly expenses as $2,725; and total monthly debt payments as\n$1,325. After expenses and debt payments, he has approximately $450 left over each month.  The\n26\nfuture payments towards the two mortgage foreclosure debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l are not\nlisted in this budget.\nApplicant's performance evaluations for 2005 and  2006 indicate that he met or exceeded\nexpectations.   His manager provided a letter indicating that Applicant has worked for him since\n27\nFebruary 2005.  He states Applicant has proven to be reliable and competent. He has been willing to\nwork overtime in order to complete his assignments on schedule.  He was promoted in October 2006\nand continues to meet or exceed expectations.28\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \"the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\n\n Department of the Navy v.

The revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006,\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guideline at issue in this case is: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one's\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.30\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, is set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\"   An administrative judge\n31\nmust apply the \"whole person concept,\" and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7)\nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n32\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.33\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The applicant has the\n\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n34\nRevised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(b).\n35\n8\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.   \"Any doubt\n34\nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.\"  \n35\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a\nclearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. I make the\nfollowing conclusions.\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nApplicant's history of financial irresponsibility raises a security concern. He encountered\nfinancial problems over the past several years, accumulating approximately $16,220 in delinquent\nconsumer accounts and an additional $40,509 debt related to a mortgage foreclosure. Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\nand FC DC \u00b619(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply to Applicant's case.  Applicant\nhas encountered difficulty meeting his financial obligations since 2002.\nThe concern under Financial Considerations can be mitigated. Applicant  has a history of\nfinancial irresponsibility spanning several years. His financial problems remain. Therefore, I cannot\napply Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long\nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment).  Applicant\ncontinues to have difficulty meeting his financial obligations.  Two new debts were listed on his most\nrecent credit report which was issued four months after his SOR was issued. Most of his delinquent\ndebts remain unresolved at the close of the record. His financial problems are current. \nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce, or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) does\nnot apply.  Although Applicant's annual income was reduced by approximately $6,000 after\nSeptember 11, 2001, due to a reduction in his work hours, his income has steadily increased since that\ntime.  When he departed his previous employer in early 2005, his annual income was $45,000, twice\nthe amount of his starting salary at the company. His income increased more than $10,000 when he\naccepted his current position. Applicant did not initiate a plan to resolve his delinquent accounts until\n\n9\n2007. I cannot conclude that he has acted responsibly under the circumstances. The reduction in\nincome occurred over six years ago.  I cannot conclude that there were recent conditions beyond\nApplicant's control which contributed to his financial situation.  FC MC \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) does not apply.\nApplicant has not attended financial counseling.  Although he has taken steps to resolve his\ndelinquent accounts, I cannot conclude that his financial problems will be resolved in the near future.\nHe intends to pay off the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, and 1.h, by taking out a loan against his\n401k. He previously paid other debts by taking out a loan against his 401k. The amount of monthly\npayments Applicant will be required to pay to the two mortgage companies in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l is\nuncertain. Applicant has only $450 left over each month.  There is a question as to his ability to meet\nhis financial obligations. Applicant's inability to make the payments after entering into payment\nagreements in May 2007 with his creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f and 1.j reflects his difficulties meeting\nhis financial obligations. It is unlikely that Applicant's financial situation will be resolved in the near\nfuture.\nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, and 1.g.  Although, Applicant\nintends to resolve three of his debts within a month after the record being closed, he will be paying\nthe debts off by taking out a loan. He hopes to pay off the other debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.i, and 1.j)\nthrough future payment plans. Applicant should be commended for attempting to get his financial\naffairs in order, however, he started too late to demonstrate a sufficient track record of financial\nrehabilitation to mitigate the concerns raised under financial considerations. \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive duties.\nIndeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the\n\u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nworthiness. I considered Applicant's favorable performance evaluations reports and the positive\ncomments made by his manager. However, his financial situation remains questionable. Although his\nevidence of rehabilitation is insufficient at this time, this decision should not be construed as a\ndetermination that Applicant cannot attain a state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify\nthe award of a DoD security clearance. Should he be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security\nclearance in the future and he were to demonstrate that he is able to meet his repayment plans with\nhis creditors and other financial obligations, he may demonstrate persuasive evidence of security\nworthiness. Based on the evidence in the record, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n10\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

Nagel, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nSeptember 24, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLokey-Anderson, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on September 14, 2005.  On June 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on July 20, 2007, and August 20,\n2007,  in which she elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a\nhearing.   Department Counsel submitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material\n(FORM) to the Applicant on June 19, 2007.  The Applicant was instructed to submit\ninformation in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant\nreceived the FORM on July 7, 2007, and she submitted no reply.  The case was\nassigned to the undersigned for resolution on September 15, 2008.  Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 31 years old.  She is employed by a defense contractor and is\nseeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because she is financially overextended and at risk\nof  having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.      \nThe Statement of Reasons sets forth 16 separate creditors and two worthless\nchecks totaling approximately $25,000.00.  The Applicant admits each of the allegations\nset forth in the SOR, except allegation 1(h).  Credit reports of the Applicant dated\nOctober 20, 2005, April 9, 2007 and September 20, 2007, reflect each of the delinquent\ndebts listed in the SOR.  (See Government Exhibits 8, 9, 10 and 11).\nSince receiving the SOR, the following debts set forth in the SOR have either\nbeen paid off by the Applicant, or she has consolidated the debt with the assistance of a\nconsumer credit counselor, and she is making monthly payments to resolve them.  (See\nGovernment Exhibits 3 and 5).\nAllegation 1(a), a delinquent debt for a medical bill in the amount of $57.00 has\nbeen paid.  Allegation 1(b), a delinquent debt for a medical bill in the amount of $86.00\nhas been paid.  Allegation 1(c), a delinquent debt for a medical bill in the amount of\n$44.00 has been paid.  Allegation 1(d), a delinquent debt owed to a creditor in the\namount of $3,927.00 has been consolidated with other debt and is being paid off on a\nmonthly basis.  Allegation 1(e), a delinquent debt owed to a telephone company in the\namount of $317.00 has been consolidated with other debt and is being paid off on a\nmonthly basis. Allegation 1(f), a delinquent debt owed to a creditor in the amount of\n$373.00 has been consolidated with other debt and is being paid off on a monthly basis.\nAllegation 1(g), a delinquent debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $3,927.00 has\nbeen consolidated with other debt and is being paid off on a monthly basis.  The\nApplicant denies allegation 1(h), a delinquent debt owed to a creditor in the amount of\n$669.00, and it remains outstanding.  Allegation 1(i), a delinquent debt owed to a power\ncompany in the amount of $512.00 has been consolidated with other debt and is being\npaid off on a monthly basis.  Allegation 1(j), a delinquent debt owed to a creditor in the\namount of $348.00 has been paid off.  Allegation 1(k), a delinquent debt owed to a\ncreditor in the amount of $904.00 has been paid off.  Allegation 1(l), a delinquent debt\nowed to a creditor in the amount of $506.00 is being consolidated with other debt and\npayment will begin in September 2007.  Allegation 1(m),  a delinquent debt owed to a\ncreditor in the amount of $289.00 is being consolidated with other debt and payment will\nbegin in September 2007.  Allegation 1(n), a delinquent debt owed to a creditor in the\namount of $211.00 is being paid through a consolidation program.  Allegation 1(o), a\n\n3\ndelinquent debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $1,903.00 is being paid through a\nconsolidation program.  Allegation 1(p), a delinquent debt owed to a creditor in the\namount of $1,212.00 is being paid through a consolidation program.  \nIn May 1999, the Applicant wrote a worthless check in the amount of $57.00 and\nin May 2000, she wrote another worthless check in the amount of $150.00.  Both of\nthese debts have since been paid.  The Applicant has made a good faith effort to\nresolve her delinquent indebtedness.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nher personal background during the clearance screening process.\nThe Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) dated September 14, 2005.  Question 28 for the application asked\nher if in the last 7 years had she been over 180 days delinquent on any debts?  The\nApplicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d.  (See Government Exhibit 6).  She failed to list any of her\ndelinquent debts, including those set forth in the SOR.\nThe Applicant falsified material facts on her security clearance application when\nshe failed to list her financial delinquencies.  The Applicant claims that she did not know\nabout the debts when she completed the security clearance application and only\nlearned about them when she was interviewed by the DoD investigator.  (See\nGovernment Exhibit 3).  This is not plausible.  The sheer number of bad debs makes it\nimpossible to believe that she was not aware of her bad debt.  Clearly the Applicant\nknew of her bad debt and intentionally sought to conceal the information from the\ngovernment when she filled out the security clearance application.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \n\n4\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\n20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.(a)  Deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\n\n5\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility and dishonesty which\ndemonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\n\n6\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F) and dishonest (Guideline E).\nThis evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of\nthe Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude\nthere is a nexus or connection with her security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.  Admittedly, the Applicant has made a good faith effort to resolve\nher past due indebtedness.  She has paid off some of her debt.  She has consolidated\nother debt and is paying it off in a systematic fashion, namely on a monthly basis.  She\nplans to continue making payments toward the debts until they are paid in full.  She\nunderstands the importance of paying her bills on time and not living beyond her\nmeans.  Under the circumstances, she has made a good faith effort to resolve her\nindebtedness, and there is evidence of financial rehabilitation.  The Applicant has\ndemonstrated that he can properly handle her financial affairs.\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; 19.(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligation; and 19.(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated\nby excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ration,\nand/or other financial analysis apply.  However, Mitigating Conditions 20.(b) the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances; 20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for\nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control and 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant\nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations).    \nOn the other hand, the evidence shows that the Applicant intentionally falsified\nher security clearance application 2005, when she deliberately failed to disclose her\ndelinquent debts.  This intentional deception goes directly to the Applicant\u2019s credibility.  I\ncannot find that she is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to classified information.\nThe Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty of clearance holders.  It is\na negative factor for security clearance purposes when an Applicant has deliberately\nprovided false information about material aspects of her personal background. \n\n7\nUnder Personal Conduct, Guideline E, Disqualifying Condition 16.(a)  Deliberate\nomission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities applies.  None of the mitigation conditions are applicable.   Accordingly,\nGuideline E is found against the Applicant.   \n \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of poor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, a lack of\ncandor, an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.\n  \nI have considered all of the evidence presented, however, it does not come close\nto mitigating the negative effects of her dishonesty and the effects that it can have on\nher ability to safeguard classified information.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 2 of the SOR.  Paragraph 1 is found for the\nApplicant.  \n     \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nFor the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.g.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.n.:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n8\n    Subpara.  1.o.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.p.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.q.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.r.:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 49-year-old ship fitter employed by a defense contractor. He has been a first class ship fitter, the highest grade within his specialty, for more than six years (Tr. 58). He has worked for his current employer since January 2001 and held a clearance since August 2001 (GX 1 at 11 and 25).

Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Thomas Albin, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal \nConduct). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on August 16, 2006. On \nMay 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, \nciting security concerns under Guideline J. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \nSeptember 17, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 16, 2008; answered it on \nMay 20, 2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received \nthe request on May 27, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on June 30, \n2008, and the case was assigned to me on July 2, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on July 2, 2008, scheduling the hearing for July 24, 2008. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AX) A and B, which were admitted without objection. The record closed upon \nadjournment of the hearing. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on August 8, 2008. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nAt the request of Department Counsel and without objection from Applicant, I \ntook administrative notice of the state statute that was the basis of Applicant\u2019s arrest, \nconviction, and sentencing (Tr. 21; Hearing Exhibit I). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. His \nadmissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old ship fitter employed by a defense contractor. He has \nbeen a first class ship fitter, the highest grade within his specialty, for more than six \nyears (Tr. 58). He has worked for his current employer since January 2001 and held a \nclearance since August 2001 (GX 1 at 11 and 25). \n \n \nIn late 2003, Applicant began a 10-month period of downloading music and child \npornography from a file-sharing website (Tr. 29). Local police identified him as a \nsuspect during a child pornography investigation, and they executed a search warrant at \nhis home on March 3, 2004. They found numerous images of children engaged in \nsexual activity on his home computer (GX 5 at 24-26).  \n \n \nApplicant testified he visited the website four or five times a week, looking for \nboth adult pornography and child pornography. He knew child pornography was illegal \nbut was attracted to the \u201coutlaw\u201d aspect of viewing it, as well as its content (Tr. 78). \nDuring the 10-month period he viewed about 1,000 images and downloaded about 100 \nimages (Tr. 79). He kept some of the images of young sexually-developed girls because \nhe was aroused by them (Tr. 81, 86). He testified he was not attracted by images of \nsexually immature children (Tr. 87). \n \n \nOn October 6, 2005, Applicant was charged with illegal possession of child \npornography, a felony. He pleaded guilty on June 9, 2006, and was sentenced to five \nyears in jail, suspended, and placed on supervised probation for five years. The terms \nof his probation required him to register as a sex offender for ten years, and undergo \nsex offender evaluation and treatment. He is prohibited from possessing a computer, \naccessing the internet, residing near a school, leaving the state, consuming alcohol, \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhaving any contact with minors, and numerous other related activities (GX 4 at 4; GX 6 \nat 5-7; Tr. 83-85).  \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant was upbeat and positive about the conditions of \nprobation (Tr. 73). He did not describe the restrictions on his activities as particularly \nonerous. He testified he began his therapy with the attitude that \u201ceverybody can benefit \nfrom therapy,\u201d and he described his group sessions as interesting, stimulating, and \ninsightful (Tr. 48).  \n \n \nApplicant has never been married. He was in a committed relationship with a \nwoman at the time of his arrest, but they broke up, largely because of his arrest. He now \nlives alone (Tr. 38-39). \n \n \nA psychologist who is the regional supervisor for the state\u2019s Center for the \nTreatment of Problem Sexual Behavior provided a progress report dated July 15, 2008. \nHe reported that Applicant \u201chas appeared genuinely involved both in gaining insight into \nhis specific offense behavior as well as learning about risk reduction in general.\u201d \nApplicant has been granted approval for limited pre-approved contact with minors, with \nhis sister acting as his approved supervisor. The psychologist opined that Applicant \n\u201cdoes not raise significant concern regarding criminality in general and sexual re-\noffending more specifically.\u201d Applicant has done well in treatment and he is moving \ntoward treatment completion, although the end date has not yet been determined (AX \nA). \n \n \nApplicant informed his family and his employer of his conviction. His coworkers \nare aware of his conviction, and they sometimes tease him about it (GX 4 at 5). He was \nnamed \u201cCivilian Craftsman of the Quarter\u201d by his employer in September 2005, and his \naward was signed in December 2005, after his arrest but before his conviction and \nsentencing (AX B; Tr. 50). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \n\n \n4 \n \n \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR contains a single paragraph alleging that Applicant\u2019s home was \nsearched; he was arrested for illegal possession of child pornography, a felony; and he \npleaded guilty and was sentenced to a suspended five-year jail sentence and five years \nof supervised probation. The concern raised by criminal conduct is that it \u201ccreates doubt \nabout a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \n\n \n5 \n \n \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 30.  \n \nA disqualifying condition may arise from \u201ca single serious crime\u201d or if an applicant \n\u201cis currently on parole or probation.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (d). Applicant was convicted of a \nfelony and is currently on probation, thereby raising both disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (d), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). The first prong of \n\u00b6 32(a) (Ahappened so long ago@) focuses on the recency of the criminal conduct.  \nThere are no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The \ndetermination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence.  \nISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  If the evidence shows Aa \nsignificant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ then an \nadministrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates Achanged \ncircumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id. \n \nApplicant\u2019s last offense was in March 2004, more than four years ago, which is a \nsignificant period of time. His criminal conduct ended in March 2004 because of police \naction, not because he voluntarily decided to desist. Since that date his personal \nfreedom has been sharply curtailed and he has been on supervised probation. It is too \nsoon to determine whether he will revert to his former behavior when the restrictions on \nhis lifestyle are lifted. Under these circumstances, I conclude the first prong of AG \u00b6 \n32(a) is not established. \n \n \nWith respect to the remaining prongs of AG \u00b6 32(a), I conclude his conduct did \nnot occur under unusual circumstances, it is too soon to determine the likelihood of \nrecurrence, and his conduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 32(a) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthere is evidence \nof successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without \nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, \ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(d). \nApplicant apparently has continued to perform well on the job and he has cooperated \nfully with the conditions of his probation. On the other hand, he has not expressed \nremorse for the victims of child pornography. As noted above, too little time has passed \nto determine if Applicant is rehabilitated. He will be on probation for at least three more \n\n \n6 \n \n \nyears. The supervisor of his mandatory treatment program observed only that Applicant \nis \u201cmoving toward\u201d treatment completion, but no end date has been established. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 32(d) is not established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, intelligent adult. He is an experienced, talented ship fitter. \nHe has worked for defense contractors and held a clearance for many years without \nincident. He was open and candid at the hearing, and he was upbeat and positive about \nthe conditions of his probation. On the other hand, he was attracted to the \u201coutlaw\u201d \naspect of downloading child pornography. Although the SOR alleges only a single \nconviction, it was based on a 10-month course of conduct in which he downloaded \nimages four or five times a week, downloading a total of about 1,000 images and \nkeeping about 100. He kept images of young but sexually developed girls because he \nfound them sexually stimulating. Although he has complied with all the conditions of his \nprobation, it is too soon to tell if he is rehabilitated. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline J, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on criminal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude \nhe has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

When completing a security \nclearance application, she forgot to list a public intoxication charge, which had occurred \n12 years earlier. Applicant has established a repayment plan with each of her creditors. \nShe has successfully mitigated the financial considerations and personal conduct \nconcerns. Clearance is granted. \n \nHistory of the Case \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke her \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive, 1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nFebruary 15, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on September 20, 2007, detailing the security concerns \nGuideline F for financial considerations based on a history of financial problems as \nevidenced by delinquent debts and Guideline E for personal conduct for falsified \nmaterial on a Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \n \n \nOn October 17, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On November 8, 2007, I was assigned the case. On \nNovember 13, 2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing for a hearing held on November \n28, 2007. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 5, which were admitted into \nevidence. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted documents admitted into \nevidence as Exhibit A. The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional \nmatters, and they were received on December 8, 2007. Department Counsel did not \nobject to the material and it was admitted into evidence as Ex. B. On December 6, \n2007, DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated June 25, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.f. with explanation. She denied the factual allegations in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a of the SOR. The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough review of the record, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old proposal coordinator who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since February 2006, and is seeking to maintain a security clearance. \nSupervisor, coworkers, and friends state Applicant is a loyal, trusted employee, \ndependable, dedicated, conscientious, intelligent, highly capable, organized, diligent, \nthorough, competent, punctual, highly efficient, hard working, has outstanding integrity, \nhonesty, loyalty, an innovative self-starter who rarely needs supervision, who continually \nexceeds expectations and cares deeply about her job and doing the best she can. (Ex. \nA) She sets an extraordinary example for others in the office and has expanded her \nduties and responsibilities. One coworker stated she was better for having known and \nworked with Applicant. (Ex. A) \n \n \nIn 2005, Applicant was in the process of divorcing her husband when he was \ninvolved in a motorcycle accident while driving drunk. (Tr. 31) He suffered brain trauma \naffecting the cognitive portion of his brain. He had the cognitive thinking of a 17-year-\nold. (Tr. 33) He used Applicant\u2019s social security number to open credit and charge \nitems. When she discovered the debts, she closed all credit cards and assumed \nresponsibility for a $23,000 credit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d.) She knew her husband could \nnot pay the debt because his only income was his disability income. Since July 2005, \nApplicant has been paying $200 for this debt on the 26th of each month by direct draft \nfrom her checking account. (Ex. B, Ex. 2, Tr. 33, 44) \n \n \nThe $171 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a was Applicant\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s magazine debt, which \nApplicant does not intend to pay. (Tr. 40) Applicant has made an offer of $570 on the \n$1,175 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant has established a repayment agreement on this \n\n \n \n \n3\ndebt. (Ex. B) She arranged for $200 to be paid in December 2007, $100 in January \n2008, and the balance to be paid from her income tax refund. (Ex. B, Tr. 34)  \n \nThe credit collection agency has offered to settle the $11,163 joint credit card \ndebt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.c for $5,581. (Ex. 2, Tr. 43) Applicant has arranged to pay $100 \nmonthly on this debt. The creditor has offered to settle the $899 debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e \nfor $494. (Ex. 2) Applicant has arranged to make $25 monthly payments on the 11th of \neach month by bank draft this debt. (Ex B, Tr. 34) Applicant provided documents \nshowing payments were made in November 2006, December 2006, February 2007, \nMay 2007, and June 2007. (Ex. B) \n \n \nApplicant has a joint debt with her ex-husband of $6,614 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Applicant \nhas an automatic $125 monthly deduction on the 11th of each month paying this debt. \n(Ex. B, Tr. 34) The repayment agreement started on September 12, 2007. (Tr. 47, 50) \nApplicant provided documents showing payments were made in November 2006, \nDecember 2006, January 2007, February 2007, March 2007, May 2007, and June \n2007. (Ex. B) \n \n \nApplicant had sought financial counseling from Consumer Credit Counseling \nService (CCCS). (Tr. 56) Due to her low income, CCCS did not see how she could \nmake a monthly payment on her debts.  Applicant now maintains a budget. (Tr. 57) She \nhas made a number of moves during the past few years that added to her financial \nburden. (Tr. 68) \n \n \nIn 1994, Applicant was charged with public intoxication. Applicant and her \nhusband were at a bar. Following an argument with her husband, she left the bar and \nwent to a convenience store to call a friend to pick her up. (Tr. 35) When she left the \nstore, her friend and the police were there. The judge dropped the charge because she \nhad called someone to pick her up and was not causing problems when arrested. (Ex. \n2) She forgot about the charge when she asked a question on her Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions about alcohol related arrests.  The charge had occurred 12 \nyears earlier.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n\n \n \n \n4\n                                                          \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F (financial considerations) a security concern typically exists \ndue to significant unpaid debts. Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy \ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.2 \n \n \nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Additionally, an \n \n2 Revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \u00b6 18. \n\n \n \n \n5\nindividual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, \nnegligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified information. \nBehaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how \na person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt \nfree, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant owed approximately $43,000 on six past-due obligations. \nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and \n19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nPrior to Applicant\u2019s divorce, her husband was involved in a motorcycle accident \nthat affected his cognitive thinking. He ran up some large debts on credit cards he had \nopened. When Applicant discovered the debts she cancelled the cards and arranged \nrepayment on the largest of the debts. Since July 2005, she has been paying $200 a \nmonth on debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d. She has also been making monthly payments in on the \ndebts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. She has arranged a repayment plan on the debts \nlisted in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. Repayment plans without a history of payments is often of \nlittle value. However, having complied with the provisions of the repayment plan on the \nother three debts, it is likely she will do so on the two plans she has recently \nestablished. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ When Applicant discovered her \nhusband was running up their debts she acted reasonably in cancelling the credit cards, \nassuming the debt, and starting a repayment plan. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. \n \nAG & 20(b), Athe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances,@ has some applicability. She was divorced \nand her husband\u2019s actions were beyond her control. \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nunder AG & 20(c), applies. She received counseling from CCCS and her obligations are \nunder control. \n \n\n \n \n \n6\nAG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has \nestablished repayment plans on five of the six debts. Applicant\u2019s conduct does not raise \nconcerns about her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nThe remaining $171 debt is her husband\u2019s debt and not her responsibility.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe allegations under Guideline E, (Personal Conduct) are refuted. The \nGovernment has shown Applicant's answer to question 23 was incorrect, but this does \nnot prove the Applicant deliberately failed to disclose information about her 1994 arrest. \nShe was arrested for public intoxication, but the charge was dropped. The event had \noccurred 12 years before she completed her questionnaire. She forgot about the arrest \nwhen she completed the questionnaire. The Applicant has denied intentional \nfalsification.  \n \nDeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written \ndocument or oral statement to the Government when applying for a security clearance \nis a security concern. But every inaccurate statement is not a falsification. A falsification \nmust be deliberate and material. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully. An \nomission concerning a 12 year old arrest is not deliberate if the person had forgotten \nabout it when completing her form. Her actions were not a deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. After hearing her testimony, \nobserving her demeanor, and evaluating all the evidence of record, I found her \ntestimony credible that she will honor the two repayment plans recently established. The \ndebts incurred were not the type that indicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n \n \n7\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. Money was not spent frivolously by \nApplicant.  \n \nApplicant has established repayment plans on her five debts. Of course, the \nissue is not simply whether all his debts are being paid\u2014it is whether her financial \ncircumstances raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance. (See AG & \n2(a)(1).) Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. When she completed her \nsecurity questionnaire she simply forgot about her arrest 12 years earlier. Her action did \nnot show questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from her financial considerations and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.f: \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the SOR. His admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. I make the following findings: Applicant is a 53-year-old electrical engineer. He has been employed as a consultant by a defense contractor since September 2006. He is regarded by his employer as a valuable employee whose ability to contribute to Department of Defense projects would be \u201cgreatly enhanced\u201d if he had a security clearance (AX A). Applicant was born in Israel, and served in the Israeli Air Force from May 1974 to August 1981, attaining the highest enlisted grade, equivalent to a sergeant major in the U.S. Army (Tr. 38-39). He held an Israeli security clearance during his military service (Tr. 39). He came to the U.S. in August 1981, after leaving the Israeli Air Force to complete his college education. He obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree and master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from a U.S. university in May 1985.

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on October 5, \n2006.  On August 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny \nhis application, citing security concerns under Guidelines B (Foreign Influence) and C \n(Foreign Preference). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 6, 2007; answered it \non the same day; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA \nreceived the request on September 10, 2007. Department Counsel was ready to \nproceed on December 7, 2007. The case was assigned to me on December 12, 2007, \nand DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 8, 2008. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on January 29, 2008. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted \nFebruary 27, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nin evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s \nrequest to keep the record open until February 15, to enable him to submit additional \nevidence.  He did not submit any additional evidence.  DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on February 7, 2008. The record closed on February 15, 2008.  On \nFebruary 21, 2008, Applicant notified me by email that he had nothing further to submit \n(AX B).  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nUnauthenticated Report of Investigation \n \n \nDepartment Counsel offered GX 3, a personal subject interview extracted from a \nreport of investigation, without calling an authenticating witness as required by the \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.20.  I explained the authentication requirement to Applicant, and he \naffirmatively waived it (Tr. 30).  Based on his waiver, I admitted GX 3. \n \nRequest to take Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout Israel. The request and all but one of the documents attached as enclosures were \nnot admitted in evidence but are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I.  I \ndeclined to take administrative notice based on a Congressional Research Service \nreport on Israel (Enclosure VI to HX I), because there was no evidence the analysis and \nopinions of the author were accepted by the U.S. government as not subject to \nreasonable dispute (Tr. 22).  I admitted the Enclosure VI, without objection from \nApplicant, as GX 4 (Tr. 28). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the \nSOR. His admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact.  I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old electrical engineer. He has been employed as a \nconsultant by a defense contractor since September 2006. He is regarded by his \nemployer as a valuable employee whose ability to contribute to Department of Defense \nprojects would be \u201cgreatly enhanced\u201d if he had a security clearance (AX A). \n \nApplicant was born in Israel, and served in the Israeli Air Force from May 1974 to \nAugust 1981, attaining the highest enlisted grade, equivalent to a sergeant major in the \nU.S. Army (Tr. 38-39). He held an Israeli security clearance during his military service \n(Tr. 39).  He came to the U.S. in August 1981, after leaving the Israeli Air Force to \ncomplete his college education. He obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree and master\u2019s degree \nin electrical engineering from a U.S. university in May 1985.  He became a U.S. citizen \nin October 1989. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n \nIn September 1974, while in military service, Applicant was married to an Israeli \ncitizen.  His wife became a U.S. citizen in September 2000 and resides with him in the \nU.S.  She is a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen.  His wife was a high school teacher in Israel, and \nshe is now a university professor of literature in the U.S. (Tr. 40, 43). They have three \nchildren who are dual citizens and reside in the U.S.  The oldest was born in Israel and \nthe other two were born in the U.S. (Tr. 42, 45). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are deceased and he has no siblings. He inherited an \napartment in Israel from his parents. The apartment is managed by his father-in-law, is \nworth about $120,000, and generates monthly rental income of about $500 (GX 2 at 20; \nTr. 53-54).  At the hearing, Applicant denied that he kept his Israeli citizenship to protect \nhis property, and Department Counsel conceded the point (Tr. 73).  All of his other \nassets are in the U.S., except for about $9,000 in a bank account in Israel, used to \nmanage the apartment (Tr. 58-59).  He estimates his net worth at about 2 million dollars \n(Tr. 61). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law, father-in-law, and brother-in-law are citizens and \nresidents of Israel.  His father-in-law is the only relative connected to the Israeli \ngovernment (GX 2 at 5).  He was employed as a publications manager for the Israeli \nMinistry of Defense from about 1965 to 1995 (GX 2 at 4).  His mother-in-law was a bank \nclerk until she retired about 10 years ago (Tr. 51).  His in-laws visited him and his wife in \nthe U.S. about a year ago and stayed for two weeks (Tr. 51-52).  Applicant and his wife \nvisited his in-laws in Israel about two weeks before the hearing (Tr. 52).  Applicant and \nhis wife talk to his father-in-law and mother-in-law once or twice a week, with the calls \nusually initiated by his wife (Tr. 57). \n \n \nApplicant retained his Israeli passport after becoming a U.S. citizen, and he used \nit to travel to Israel in March 1998, July 1998, December 1999, March 2004, January \n2005, January 2006, and November 2007.  He used his U.S. passport for all other \nforeign travel (GX 3 at 1; Tr. 35).   \n \nIn January 2007, Applicant told a security investigator he was willing to renounce \nhis Israeli citizenship and surrender his passport if it was a condition for obtaining a \nclearance (GX 3 at 2).  In response to DOHA interrogatories executed in May 2007, \nApplicant stated he was willing to destroy, surrender, or invalidate his Israeli passport if \nit was necessary to obtain a clearance (GX 2 at 15).  At the hearing, Applicant testified \nhe talked with an official at the Israeli Consulate about the possibility of \u201ckeeping the \npassport there,\u201d and obtaining substitute travel documents from the consulate when he \ntravels to Israel (Tr. 54, 56).  He also testified he would be willing to surrender his \npassport to his facility security officer and obtain a letter stating that the passport had \nbeen surrendered (Tr. 55).  Finally, he testified he did not intend to renew his Israeli \npassport (Tr. 64).The passport\u2019s expiration date was February 8, 2008.   \n \n \nApplicant testified he would be willing to renounce his Israeli citizenship (Tr. 56).  \nHe had discussed the procedure for renouncing his citizenship with the Israeli \n\n \n4 \n \n \nConsulate but had not taken any action to do so (Tr. 66).  When the record closed on \nFebruary 15, 2008, Applicant had not provided any documentation regarding his Israeli \ncitizenship or the disposition of his passport. \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts about Israel. Israel is a \nparliamentary democracy with a diversified, technologically advanced economy.  Almost \nhalf of Israel\u2019s exports are high technology, including electronic and biomedical \nequipment.  The U.S. is Israel\u2019s largest trading partner.  Israel has been identified as a \nmajor practitioner of industrial espionage against U.S. companies.  Israel generally \nrespects the rights of its citizens.  When human rights violations have occurred, they \nhave involved Palestinian detainees or Arab-Israelis.  Terrorist suicide bombings are a \ncontinuing threat in Israel, and U.S. citizens are advised to be cautious.  The U.S. and \nIsrael have close cultural, historic, and political ties. They participate in joint military \nplanning and training, and have collaborated on military research and weapons \ndevelopment.  Commitment to Israel\u2019s security has been a cornerstone of U.S. Middle \nEast policy since Israel\u2019s creation in 1948. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . \n. . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether \nan individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person \naccess to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of \nDefense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. \nOr. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information.  This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.  The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-\n0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law, father-in-law, and brother-in-law are \ncitizens and residents of Israel, and his father-in-law was employed by the Israeli \nMinistry of Defense from about 1965 to 1995 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c). It also alleges \nApplicant\u2019s wife and three children are dual U.S.-Israeli citizens residing in the U.S. (\u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d, 1.e).  Finally, it alleges Applicant owns property worth $120,000 in Israel and earns \nrental income from the property (\u00b6 1.f).  The security concern relating to Guideline B is \nset out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \n\n \n6 \n \n \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nA disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(a).  A disqualifying condition \nalso may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect \nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, \ngroup, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b).  Finally, a security concern \nmay be raised if an applicant is \u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons, \nregardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(d).  Applicant\u2019s wife and three \nchildren are dual citizens, and his wife has three immediate family members who are \ncitizens and residents of Israel.  Based on this evidence, AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (d) are \nraised. \n \n \nA security concern also may be raised by \u201ca substantial business, financial, or \nproperty interest in a foreign country . . . which could subject the individual to \nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(e). The value of the \napartment building, $120,000, is a relatively small part of Applicant\u2019s total assets.  \nNevertheless, its value is sufficiently \u201csubstantial\u201d to raise AG \u00b6 7(e). \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), (d), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a).  The totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well \nas each individual family tie must be considered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. \nBd. Sep. 22, 2003). \n \nA[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, the immediate family members of the person's spouse.@   ISCR Case No. \n01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).  The presumption has \nnot been rebutted in this case. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-\n0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. \n \n \nAll members of Applicant\u2019s immediate family are citizens and residents of the \nU.S.  His brother-in-law\u2019s specific occupation is not reflected in the record, but none of \nhis in-laws are currently connected to the Israeli government or armed forces.  His \nmother-in-law and father-in-law were not involved in high technology industries likely to \nbe involved in industrial espionage. While his father-in-law and mother-in-law are \ndependent on the Israeli government for their pensions and medical care, the Israeli \ngovernment does not have a record of abusing its own citizens as a means of \nconducting industrial or military espionage.  I conclude the mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 \n8(a) is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(b).  \nApplicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing tended to show his willingness to sever his ties to \nIsrael.  As such, his testimony tended to support this mitigating condition.  However, his \nfailure to provide documentation of his stated intentions to surrender his Israeli passport \nand renounce his Israeli citizenship undermines his testimony at the hearing.  I conclude \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns arising from ownership of foreign property can be mitigated by \nshowing that \u201cthe value or routine nature of the . . . property interests is such that they \nare unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, \nmanipulate, pressure the individual.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(f). Applicant\u2019s ownership of property in \nIsrael is not dependent on being an Israeli citizen, and Israel does not have a record of \nusing foreign-owned property as leverage for industrial espionage.  Applicant appeared \nto have little personal attachment to the rental property, and he has considered \n\n \n8 \n \n \ndisposing of it, perhaps by giving it to his children. The evidence regarding this \nmitigating condition is inconclusive, meaning that Applicant has not carried his burden of \nproof.  AG \u00b6 8(f) is not established. \n \nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant currently possesses an Israeli passport that will \nexpire on February 8, 2008 (\u00b6 2.a), he used his passport to travel to Israel on numerous \noccasions (\u00b6 2.b), he maintained his Israeli citizenship to protect his property in Israel (\u00b6 \n2.c), and he served in the Israeli Air Force from May 1974 to August 1981 (\u00b6 2.d).  The \nconcern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 9 as follows: \u201cWhen an individual acts in \nsuch a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then \nhe or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the \ninterests of the United States.\u201d   \n \n \nDual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient to warrant an adverse security \nclearance decision.  ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5, 2000 WL 1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, \n2000).  Under Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an applicant is a dual national, but \nrather whether an applicant shows a preference for a foreign country through actions.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 15, 1999). \n \nA disqualifying condition may arise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or \nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited \nto \u201cpossession of a current foreign passport.\u201d  AG \u00b6 10(a)(1).  At the time of the hearing, \nApplicant possessed a \u201ccurrent foreign passport,\u201d which he had used many times to visit \nIsrael.  The passport had an expiration date of February 8, 2008.  Although Applicant \npromised to provide documentation that the passport had been surrendered to an Israeli \ndiplomatic official or his facility security officer, he provided nothing.  On this record, I \ncannot determine whether Applicant surrendered, destroyed, obtained an extension of \nits expiration date, or renewed it.  I conclude AG \u00b6 10(a)(1) is not established because \nthere is no evidence Applicant has a \u201ccurrent foreign passport.\u201d   \n \nNevertheless, the record also established he exercised his Israeli citizenship on \nnumerous occasions by using his Israeli passport.  Thus, the general disqualifying \ncondition under AG \u00b6 10(a) is raised, even though none of the illustrative examples in \nAG \u00b6 10(a)(1)-(7) are applicable.  \n \nDepartment Counsel conceded that Applicant did not maintain his Israeli \ncitizenship to protect his property interests.  Thus, I resolve SOR \u00b6 2.c in his favor. \n \nApplicant\u2019s military service in the Israeli Air Force does not raise a disqualifying \ncondition because it occurred before he became a U.S. citizen.  Thus, I resolve SOR \u00b6 \n2.d in his favor. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nBecause the disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 10(a) is raised, the burden \nshifted to Applicant to rebut, explain, mitigate, or extenuate the facts.  Several mitigating \nconditions are relevant. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cdual \ncitizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d  AG \u00b6 \n11(a).  This mitigating condition is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by if \u201cthe individual \nhas expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(b).  Applicant has \nstated numerous times, including at the hearing, that he is willing to renounce dual \ncitizenship, if it is a condition for obtaining a clearance.  He has discussed the \nprocedure for renouncing his Israeli citizenship with appropriate Israeli official, but he \nfailed to produce evidence that he acted on his stated intention.   \n \n \nIn response to my questions, Applicant repeated his willingness to surrender his \nIsraeli passport and renounce his Israeli citizenship if it was necessary to obtain a \nclearance.  Applicant appeared to believe he could agree to surrender his passport and \nrenounce his Israeli citizenship and obtain a clearance contingent upon carrying out \nthose promises.  I explained that possession of an Israeli passport was \u201ca major \nobstacle to overcome,\u201d and he needed to decide what to do.  I kept the record open, \nexplaining, \u201c[T]his will give you time to consult with people if you want to talk with family, \ndecide what you want to do, and if you decide to take any actions to provide \ndocumentation to me and to Department Counsel.\u201d  I emphasized, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell \nyou what my decision is, but I\u2019m telling you that [the passport is] a major consideration, \nwhich is why we\u2019re here.\u201d  (Tr. 70-71.)  At the conclusion of the hearing, I reminded \nApplicant, \u201cI\u2019ll leave it up to you what documentation you want to present, but we\u2019ve left \nopen some unanswered questions, and in part you need to decide what you want to do, \nand then you need to document it.\u201d  (Tr. 80.)   \n \nApplicant apparently wanted to be assured he would receive a clearance before \nsurrendering his passport or renouncing his citizenship.  An administrative judge does \nnot have authority to grant a conditional clearance.  ISCR Case No. 99-0901, 2000 WL \n288429 at *3 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000).  A conditional willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship is insufficient to establish AG \u00b6 11(b). \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on possession or use of a foreign passport may be \nmitigated if \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(e).  Applicant has produced no evidence \nregarding disposition of his passport.  An expired passport is \u201cotherwise invalidated.\u201d  \nHowever, on this record, I cannot determine whether he surrendered it, destroyed it, \nrenewed it, or kept it with the intention of renewing it when he needs it.  I conclude AG \u00b6 \n11(e) is not established. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated, very intelligent adult.  However, he \nappeared to have difficulty understanding he could not be promised he would receive a \nclearance before disposing of his Israeli passport.  He said the right words about \nsurrendering his passport and renouncing his citizenship, but he failed to provide \ndocumentation that he carried out his stated intentions. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines B and \nC, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence, but he has not \nmitigated the security concerns based on foreign preference. Accordingly, I conclude he \nhas not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nParagraph 2, Foreign Preference:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nThe Applicant is a dual citizen of Iran and the United States.  He has expressed a willingness\nto renounce his Iranian citizenship and he has surrendered his Iranian passport.  Despite this, he has\nsignificant family ties in Iran that could raise a security concern.  Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n2\nOn May 2, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on May 24, 2007, and he requested a hearing before a\nDOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the undersigned on July 11, 2007.  A notice\nof hearing was issued on August 9, 2007, scheduling the hearing for August 29, 2007.  At the hearing\nthe Government presented six exhibits.  The Applicant presented six exhibits and testified on his\nown behalf.  The record was left open until September 18, 2007, to allow the Applicant an\nopportunity to provide additional evidence.  The Applicant submitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit that\nwas admitted into evidence and the record was closed on September 19, 2007.  The official transcript\n(Tr.) was received on September 12, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the testimony\nand the exhibits.  The Applicant is 25 years of age and has a Bachelor\u2019s of Science in Computer\nEngineering.  He is employed as a Software Engineer for a  defense contractor.  He seeks a security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in such a way as to show a preference for\nanother country over the United States.\nThe Applicant was born in the United States to dual citizens of Iran and the United States.\nIranian law declares that if the Applicant\u2019s father is an Iranian citizen, the Applicant is automatically\nan Iranian citizen.  Thus, the Applicant is a dual citizen of Iran and the United States.  The Applicant\nlived in the United States his entire life until June 2006, when he moved to France for a work\nassignment for a defense contractor.  He has never resided in Iran.    \nAs a child, the Applicant traveled to Iran with his parents on a number of occasions to visit\nrelatives and entered the country by using his parent\u2019s passport.  After the age of eighteen, he\nobtained his own Iranian passport that was issued to him on February 11, 2001.  He has used that\npassport on one occasion to travel to Iran to visit relatives.  This Iranian passport expired on\nFebruary 11, 2006, and the Applicant does not know where it is.  He further states that he has no\nintention to renew it.  He indicates that he has contacted the Iranian embassy in Paris and requested\nto renounce his Iranian citizenship.  They referred him to Article 988 indicating that Iranian national\ncannot abandon their nationality except under certain conditions that he is unable to meet.      \n\n3\nSince 1998, the Applicant has traveled to Iran on three separate occasions.  During his most\nrecent trip to Iran, from December 19, 2005 through January 8, 2006, he used his own Iranian\npassport.\nBy letter dated August 30, 2007, the Applicant requested to renounce his Iranian citizenship\nand surrender his Iranian passport.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit).\nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts that could create the potential\nfor foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.\nThe Applicant\u2019s father, mother, uncle, two aunts, grandparents and extended family members\nare citizens of and reside in Iran.  The Applicant has a close bond and loving relationship with his\nparents in Iran.  They are also dual citizens of Iran and the United States.  His mother is 59 or 60\nyears old.  She is a retired housewife.  His father is 60 or 61 years of age and was a computer\nengineer in the United States before moving to Iran.  Based upon the nature of his work and past\nexperience his father has the capacity to understand what the Applicant is doing for the United States\ndefense department.  His father permanently resides in Iran because of his obligations to stay and\ntake care of the Applicant\u2019s grandparents.  The Applicant\u2019s mother travels back and forth between\nIran and the United States.  His parents plan on eventually returning to the United States, but they\nare not certain when.  The Applicant maintains regular contact with his parents in Iran.  He contacts\nhis mother in Iran about once a week and  his father about twice a week by e-mail or telephone.  The\nApplicant\u2019s father served in the Iranian military during the Shah\u2019s regime.  His parents own property\nin Iran that they have inherited.  His parents both know that he has applied for a security clearance.\nThe Applicant has an older brother who is a citizen and resident of the United States.       \nThe Applicant contacts his grandparents in Iran about once a year.  They own property and\nan apartment building in Iran. \nThe Applicant has no assets in Iran at the present time.  Bank statements of the Applicant\nshow that he has significant financial assets in the United States.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing\nExhibit).  In the United States, he has about $100,000 dollars in his 401(k) retirement account, and\nabout another $100,000 dollars in other investments which include stocks , mutual funds and bank\naccounts.  He also has a bank account in France, that enables him to handle his regular monthly\nexpenses while working abroad.  He owns no property in the United States or in Iran.  \nThe Applicant was a member of the Iranian Student foundation while he was a student at the\nUniversity of Maryland.  He explained that the organization was not political or affiliated with the\nIranian government in any way.  It was a cultural or social group and was sponsored by the\nUniversity.   \nI have taken administrative notice of the current political conditions in Iran.  The fact that\nIran has no diplomatic relations with the United States.  Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons\nand other weapon of mass destruction, its support for and involvement in international terrorism, it\u2019s\nsupport for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process, and it\u2019s dismal human rights records\nI have considered the fact that Iranian Government officials at all levels commit serious abuses of\n\n4\ntheir power and authority.  The fact that Iran has terrorists activities, and is rampant with crime and\ninstability.  The overall deteriorating security situation in Iran, the human rights abuses, and the\ngovernment corruption elevates the cause for concern in the case.  The United States may face no\ngreater challenge from a single country than from Iran.    \nLetters of recommendation submitted on behalf of the Applicant attest to his professional\nskill, team spirit and outstanding performance on the job.  He is also considered forthright, honest,\nhardworking and easy to get along with.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit).\nApplicant\u2019s performance development summaries reflect that he has done an excellent job,\nexceeding expectations for his position with the company.  He is a quick learner, team player,\nexcellent communicator and self trainer.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit).    \nThe Applicant\u2019s Facility Security Officer indicates that from May 5, 2006 through March 8,\n2007, during the period the Applicant held a security clearance, he did not have any security\nviolations and was very conscientious in carrying out his related duties and responsibilities.\n      \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors and conditions that could\nraise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security\nclearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent\ncriterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any\ncase, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be\nassumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.\nBased on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this\ncase are:\nForeign Preference\n9.  The Concern.  When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the United States, then he or he may be prone to provide information or make decisions\nthat are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n10.  (a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a\nU.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n\n5\n11.  (a) dual citizenship is based solely on parent\u2019s citizenship or birth in a foreign country;\n11.  (b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n11.  (e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority , or\notherwise invalidated.\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is\nlocated, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known\nto target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisks of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general\nfactors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n\n6\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and\nconduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order\n10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting\nthese personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number\nof variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.   The\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence\nwhich is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline C (foreign preference), and\nGuideline B (foreign influence) that establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse\nconduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of\nproof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct, is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign preference and has foreign connections may be\nprone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nThe mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate questions as to whether the Applicant\ncan be counted upon to place the interests of the United States paramount to that of another nation.\nThe Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to\nabide by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal standards and\nfactors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this Administrative\nJudge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nUnder Foreign Preference, Disqualifying Condition 10(a) exercise of any right, privilege or\nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of\n\n7\na family member applies.  However, Mitigation Conditions 11(a) dual citizenship is based solely on\nparent\u2019s citizenship or birth in a foreign country, 11(b) the individual has expressed a willingness\nto renounce dual citizenship, and 11(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the\ncognizant security authority , or otherwise invalidated also apply.\nIt is only by reason of birth that the Applicant is a dual citizen of Iran and the United States.\nAt one time, he possessed a foreign passport in order to travel to Iran to visit his family members\nthere, including his parents, who are citizens of and reside in Iran.  The Applicant has since\nrenounced his Iranian citizenship and surrendered his Iranian passport.  He does not intend to return\nto Iran in the future.  Under the circumstances of this case, I find for the Applicant under Guideline\nC (Foreign Preference). \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) contact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risks of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion applies.  None of the mitigation conditions apply. \nThe Applicant has many family members that include his mother, father, uncle, two aunts,\ngrandparents and other extended family members who reside in Iran.  He is very close to his mother\nand father who reside in Iran and has regular ongoing contact with them by telephone and e-mail.\nAlthough there is no evidence that any of his family members in Iran are associated in any way with\nthe Iranian government, there is a close bond and strong evidence of affection with his immediate\nfamily.  Furthermore, the Applicant\u2019s father was trained and educated as a computer engineer.  He\nis quite capable of understanding what the Applicant does for the defense department, and he knows\nthat the Applicant has applied for a security clearance.  The Applicant\u2019s parents and grandparents\nhave assets in Iran that the Applicant may someday inherit.  Moreover, the current political situation\nin Iran elevates the cause for concern in this case.  The possibility of foreign influence exists that\ncould create the potential for conduct resulting in the compromise of classified information.  I find\nthat the Applicant is vulnerable to foreign influence.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence).\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions of\nGuideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  Accordingly,\nhe has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.  Guideline C is found for the\nApplicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n\n8\nSubparas.\n1.a.: For the Applicant\n1.b.: For the Applicant\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\nSubparas.\n2.a.: Against the Applicant\nSubparas.\n2.b.: Against the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n2.c.: Against the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n2.d.: Against the Applicant\nSubparas.\n2.e.: Against the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n2.f.: Against the Applicant\n \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620\n(1966).  In this instance, even if the challenged findings were changed to reflect Applicant\u2019s\ninterpretation of the record evidence, it would not have undermined the Judge\u2019s conclusions.\nTherefore, any such error would be at most harmless.  See ISCR Case No. 05-08459 at 2, n.1 (App.\nBd. Nov. 16, 2006).  Considering the record as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings with respect\nto Applicant\u2019s circumstances of security concern reflect a sustainable interpretation of the record\nevidence and are supported by substantial evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-21933 at 2 (App.\nBd. Aug. 18, 2006).\nApplicant points to several hearing-level cases by this Judge which he contends support\ngranting him a clearance.  The Board gives due consideration to these cases.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-05903 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2007).  However, the Board has previously noted that decisions\nin other hearing-level cases are not legally binding precedent, even if an applicant can establish close\nfactual similarities between those cases and his case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-04004 at 2 (App.\nBd. Jul. 31, 2006).  Accordingly, the Judge was not legally obligated to reconcile his decision in this\ncase with his decisions in other ostensibly similar cases.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25743 at 2\n(App. Bd. Jan. 10, 2008).  \u201cThe adjudication process is the careful weighing of a number of variables\nknown as the whole-person concept.\u201d  Directive at \u00b6 E2.2(a).  \u201cEach case must be judged on its own\nmerits . . .\u201d Id at \u00b6 E2.2(b).  Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s reading of the Judge\u2019s decision regarding\nApplicant\u2019s age at the time he immigrated to the U.S. is not dispositive.  The Judge may reasonably\nhave been discussing Applicant\u2019s ties to Taiwan prior to his immigration. \n \n\n3\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-09542 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4,\n2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08116 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2007). \nA review of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence\noffered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances, and considered the\npossible application of relevant mitigating conditions and factors.  The Judge reasonably explained\nwhy the evidence presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Judge\u2019s decision exhibits a discerning weighing of a number of variables to reach a\ncommonsense determination. Directive \u00b6 E2.2(c).  It articulated a reasonable concern that Applicant's\ncircumstances could create a conflict of interest or be used to influence, manipulate, or pressure him.\nThat concern is based on close family ties in Taiwan, considered in the context of the overall\npolitical/security profile of that country vis-a-vis the United States.  Applicant offers an alternative\ninterpretation of the record evidence.  However, that alternative interpretation of the record evidence\nis insufficient to render the Judge\u2019s interpretation arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 03-19101 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 13, 2006).  The Judge has articulated a rational\nexplanation for his unfavorable determination and there is sufficient record evidence to support that\ndetermination\u2014given the standard that required the Judge to err on the side of national security.\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(b).\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

TUIDER \n \n \nAPPEARANCES \n \nFOR GOVERNMENT \nEric Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro Se \n \n \nSYNOPSIS \n \nApplicant emigrated from Taiwan to the United States in 1985 and became a U.S. citizen \nin 1994. He was unable to mitigate foreign influence concerns because of his close and frequent \ncontacts with his mother, two brothers and two sisters, who are residents and citizens of Taiwan.  \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n \nOn March 29, 2005, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86).1 On \nJune 20, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nWithin Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 \n \n The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The SOR \ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nIn an answer notarized on July 12, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, \nand elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nAugust 9, 2007. On August 15, 2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case to be \nheard on October 3, 2007.  The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \n  The Government offered two documents, which were admitted without objections as \nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 1 and 2. The Applicant offered four documents, which were admitted \nwithout objections as Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 through 4. I held the record open to afford \nApplicant an additional opportunity to submit additional material.  Applicant timely submitted \nadditional documents, which were admitted without objection as AE 5. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on October 10, 2007. \n \nPROCEDURAL RULINGS \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of the facts in Exhibits (Exs.) I \nthrough X. Without objection from Applicant, I took administrative notice of the documents \noffered by Department Counsel, which primarily pertained to Taiwan. (Tr. 17-18).  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative \nproceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. \n                                                          \n1GE 1 (Security Clearance Application, bears the date of Mar. 29, 2005 on p. 1. The signature page bears \nthe date of Mar. 31, 2005). For convenience, the security clearance application in this decision will be called an SF \n86.  \n2On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum directing \napplication of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive \nand Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, \nas amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The revised Adjudicative Guidelines are \napplicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n\n \n3\n02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, \n2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). \nThe most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are \neither well known or from government reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 \n(Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Various facts \npertaining to Taiwan were derived from Exs. I through X as indicated under subheading \n\u201cTaiwan\u201d of this decision. \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT  \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of \nthe evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 49 years old. He was born in the Taiwan in 1958, where he was raised.  He \nattended college in Taiwan and was awarded a bachelor of science degree majoring in electrical \nengineering in June 1980.  \n \nIn August 1985, at age 27, Applicant emigrated to the U.S. to attend graduate school and \nin December 1986, he was awarded a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering.  In March 1989, \nhe was granted permanent resident alien status (green card), and in August 1994, he became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen. His current U.S. passport was issued to him in August 2004. He married \nhis wife in September 1991. She like him was born and raised in Taiwan. Applicant and his wife \nhave two U.S. born children, a 14-year-old daughter and a 10-year-old son. Applicant\u2019s wife is \nan accountant by profession, but currently is a homemaker. She became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen in June 2000.    \n \nSince March 2005, Applicant has worked for a defense contractor and is currently \nemployed as a principal software engineer. He seeks a security clearance in conjunction with his \nemployment. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, two brothers and two sisters are residents and citizens of Taiwan. His \nfather is deceased and his mother is an 81-year-old retired homemaker. His late father worked for \na private commercial shipping company as a radioman. Applicant\u2019s mother lives in a senior \ncitizen\u2019s apartment community and derives her income primarily from savings and to a lesser \nextent from social security.  \n \nApplicant is the youngest of three brothers.  His oldest brother is a 56-year-old \nmechanical engineer, who works for a state-owned company that is undergoing privatization. He \nis married, his wife is a homemaker, and his only child is a college student. Tr. 23-26, 44-47, AE \n3 and 5. His other brother is a 55-year-old retired technician, who worked for a private railroad \ncompany. He is married, his wife owns a home-based cosmetic business, and they have two adult \nchildren, a son and daughter.

SOR Para. 1.a. Applicant\u2019s mother and four siblings each \nexecuted a statement stating they will not try to acquire job-related information from Applicant. \nAE 3. \n \nApplicant\u2019s contact with his relatives in Taiwan varies, which he described below: \n \nReferring to his contact with his mother: \u201cI manage to call her [] every other week.  And I \ntry to see her once [] every four years.\u201d Tr. 33.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s contact with his four siblings in Taiwan beginning with his 56-year-old \nbrother: \u201cIt really varies. I [have] contact with my oldest brother the most. It\u2019s [on] average, one \nphone call every month. It varies. Sometimes we haven\u2019t talked to each other for months. \nSometimes he may call me, either he call me once, more than once in a month. But we may \nnever talk to each other for four \u2013 five months. . . . My average is [] once, every month.\u201d Tr. 58.  \n \nReferring to his contact with his 55-year-old brother: \u201c[o]nce every four to six months. \nWe don\u2019t talk to each other [a] lot.\u201d Tr. 60. \n \nReferring to his contact with his 51-year-old sister: \u201cIt\u2019s less than once a month. I would \nthink about one, once a month, once every other month. Kind of like that. It really varies. \nSometimes, when something happen[s] to my mom or some other issue would come, she would \ncall me more often. And sometimes we haven\u2019t talked to each other - - \u201c Tr. 59-60. \n \nReferring to his contact with his 46-year-old sister: \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing (referring to the \namount of contact he has with his 55-year-old brother). [I]t was every four months or so. She\u2019s \nvery busy.\u201d Tr. 61. \n \nApplicant also exchanges occasional e-mails with his older brother. Tr. 58-59.    \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are resident citizens of Taiwan. They are \nboth retired.  His father-in-law was a chef and his mother-in-law was a homemaker.

Tr. 62-63.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is one of four children. She has a brother and sister, who live in the U.S. \nand one brother, who lives in Taiwan. Her brother, who lives in the U.S. is a U.S. citizen and her \nsister, who lives in the U.S. has a green card and will soon be eligible for U.S. citizenship. \nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law (wife\u2019s brother), who lives in the U.S. owns a personal computer \nretail business. Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law (wife\u2019s sister) lives in the U.S. and is employed as an \naccountant. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law (wife\u2019s brother) in Taiwan is married and is a school \n\n \n5\nteacher. Applicant \u201crarely\u201d communicates with his in-laws, however, his wife \u201ctalks to them \nmostly.\u201d Tr. 36-37, 55-57. \n \nApplicant and his family traveled to Taiwan in March 1998, February 1999, and \nDecember 2002. Applicant stated during these visits he was never contacted by any Taiwanese \ngovernment official attempting to elicit information from him. AE 3.  SOR Para. 1.c. Although \nnot alleged, Applicant traveled to Taiwan \u201cseven to eight\u201d times since he emigrated to the U.S. \nin 1985, which includes the three trips alleged in the SOR.

He has also taken advantage of the extensive in house training offered by his \nemployer. AE 1 and 2. \n \nTaiwan3 \n \nIn 1949, two million refugees fled from a civil war in mainland China to the island of \nTaiwan and established a separate, provisional capital for a government under Chiang Kai-shek.  \nThat same year, Communists in mainland China established the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC or China).   The PRC does not recognize Taiwan\u2019s independence, and insists that there is \nonly \u201cone China.\u201d \n   \n \nSince in 1949, trade, human rights, and regional issues have dominated U.S.-Sino \nrelations, with particular disagreement on the status of Taiwan.  Although the United States has \nlong recognized Taiwan\u2019s independence, on January 1, 1979, the U.S. formally recognized the \ngovernment of the PRC as the sole legal government of China.  The U.S. does not support \nindependence for Taiwan and is committed to a \u201cone-China policy,\u201d under the Taiwan Relations \nAct, signed into law on April 10, 1979.  \n \n \nChina has an authoritarian government, dominated by the Chinese Communist Party, and \npossesses a large and increasingly sophisticated military, including strategic nuclear weapons \nand missiles.   The Intelligence Threat Handbook notes that \u201c[t]he United States is a primary \nintelligence target of China because of the U.S. role as a global superpower; its substantial \nmilitary, political, and economic presence in the Pacific Rim and Asia; its role as a developer of \nadvanced technology that China requires for economic growth; and the large number of \nAmericans of Chinese ancestry, who are considered prime intelligence targets by the PRC.\u201d  The \nU.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission made the following \u201cKey Finding\u201d in \nits 2006 report to Congress (Ex. IX): \n                                                          \n3 The contents of the Taiwan section are from Exs. I through X. \n\n \n6\n \nChina makes a concerted effort to modernize its military by obtaining military-\nrelated systems and technologies from other countries, particularly Russia.  China \nuses legal and illegal means, including espionage, to obtain such technologies \nfrom the United States. \n \n \nThe PRC\u2019s Military Intelligence Department, First Bureau, is responsible for collecting \nmilitary information about the United States and Taiwan.  The PRC\u2019s Ministry of State Security \nis the \u201cpreeminent civilian intelligence collection agency in China,\u201d and it maintains intelligence \noperations in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, through a bureau utilizing PRC nationals with \nHong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan connections (emphasis added). \n \n \nTaiwan is a multi-party democracy that has significant economic contacts with mainland \nChina, and it has developed a strong economy since its separation from the PRC.  However, \nTaiwan\u2019s own national security remains under constant threat from the PRC, prompting the \ndevelopment of Taiwan\u2019s large military establishment. \n  \n \nTaiwan, also, is an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence.  The 2000 Annual \nReport to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, prepared by \nNational Counterintelligence Center (NACIC), lists Taiwan \u2013 as well as China \u2013  as being among \nthe most active collectors of U.S. economic and proprietary information.   This report highlights \nspecific incidents wherein Taiwan stole proprietary information and engaged in attempts to \nacquire export-restricted products. \n    \n \nThese collection activities are ongoing, as evidenced by the January 2006 conviction and \nfour-year prison sentence of Jonathan C. Sanders on charges related to the theft of sensitive and \nproprietary information by and for Taiwan companies.  Additionally, in December 2005, Donald \nKeyser, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, pled \nguilty to illegally removing classified materials and to providing false statements to the U.S. \nGovernment.  Mr. Keyser was engaged in a personal relationship with an intelligence officer \nemployed by the National Intelligence Bureau, the foreign intelligence agency of the government \nof Taiwan, and he regularly communicated with her by telephone, by email, and in person. \n \nPOLICIES \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security or trustworthiness suitability, an administrative \njudge must consider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to \nClassified Information\u201d (AG(s)). The AGs include brief introductory explanations for each AG, \nand provide specific disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. \n \n \nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. AG \u00b6 2. An administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. Because the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person \n\n \n  \n \n7\nconcept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. AG \u00b6 2(c). \n \n \nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AGs \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the \nconduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the \npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d  \n  \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final \ndecision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for access to classified [or sensitive] information will be resolved in \nfavor of national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. \nLikewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d4 demonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access \nto classified information. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a \ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and \n[applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5 \n \nA person seeking access to classified or sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. It is because of this special \nrelationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those \nindividuals to whom it grants access to such information. Decisions under this Directive include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail \nto protect or safeguard classified or sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree \n                                                          \n4 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. \nAug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the \npossibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from \nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n5\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, \nevaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] \nwhether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 \n(App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n  \n \n8\nof legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of such \ninformation. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision \nshould be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express \nor implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order \n10865, \u00a7 7.  \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n  \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate \nlegal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the \nfollowing with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \n  \nAGs \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating, \u201cif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or she] may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \nthat is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. \nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain \nprotected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d \n \nAGs \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \nin this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that \ncontact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; and, \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a \npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect \nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a \nmatter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign \ncountry, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create \nthe potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-\n0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). Applicant has frequent contacts with his mother and siblings, who \nare resident citizens of Taiwan.  Applicant visited his family \u201cseven to eight times\u201d since he \nemigrated to the U.S. in 1985. His wife also has frequent contacts with her parents and sibling in \n\n \n  \n \n9\nTaiwan. Applicant\u2019s close relationship with his immediate family creates a significant risk of \nforeign pressure or attempted exploitation because Taiwan has an active collection program.  \n \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions as \nit pertains to Applicant\u2019s family, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. As previously indicated, the burden of disproving a mitigating \ncondition never shifts to the Government. \n \n  \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AGs \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable \nto these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country \nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or \ngovernment and the interests of the U.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty \nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, \nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nU.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that \nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \nAGs \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) do not apply to his relationships with his parents and four siblings in \nTaiwan. Applicant maintains frequent contact with these immediate relatives, some more than \nothers, and this frequent contact supports the conclusion his relationship with them is close. He \nhas also visited his family seven to eight time since he emigrated to the U.S. in 1985. These facts \nare indicia of the nature of his relationship with these family members, and that such contact is \nnot casual and infrequent.    \n \nApplicant did not establish \u201cit is unlikely [he] will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of [his immediate family members] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d \nHis frequent contacts with them could potentially force him to choose between the United States \nand Taiwan. He did not meet his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his \nrelationship with his immediate family members] could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation.\u201d   \n \nAGs \u00b6 8(b) partially applies because Appellant has developed a significant relationship \nand loyalty to the U.S. He has continuously lived in the United States since 1985. He and his \nwife are U.S. citizens. His two children are U.S. born citizens. He received a graduate degree in \nthe U.S. He is heavily vested in the U.S., financially and emotionally. \n   \n \n\n \n  \n \n10\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as discussed \npreviously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person \nconcept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge \nmust not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life separately, in a piecemeal manner. \nRather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances.\u201d6 The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors \n(APF) which are used for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  Because foreign influence does not involve \nmisconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the eighth \nAPF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.8, is the \nmost relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.7 In addition to the eighth APF, other \n\u201c[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.  Ultimately, the clearance \ndecision is \u201can overall common sense determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.     \n \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s \npersonal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the U.S. relative to his \n[or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the U.S.; and many others \nraised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).  \n  \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant has lived in the United States for 22 years, and he has been a naturalized citizen for 13 \nyears. When he became a U.S. citizen, he swore allegiance to the United States. His wife is also \na naturalized U.S citizen and his two children are U.S. born citizens. He has emphasized his \nloyalty to the U.S. and how much he values and enjoys his life in the U.S. There is no evidence \nhe has ever taken any action which could cause potential harm to the U.S. He takes his loyalty to \nthe U.S. very seriously, and he has worked diligently for a defense contractor for two years. All \nhis financial ties are in the U.S. No derogatory evidence was developed against him. The \nevidence points to the fact that Applicant is a decent, honest, loyal and productive member of \nsociety. \n \nFour circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis. First, PRC\u2019s \ngovernment is a rival of the U.S. See discussion under \u201cTaiwan.\u201d More importantly for security \npurposes, PRC and Taiwan actively seek classified and industrial/economic information. PRC \nand/or Taiwan may attempt to use his immediate relatives who live in Taiwan to obtain such \ninformation. This may occur notwithstanding his family members\u2019 assertion that they would \n                                                          \n6 ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2005) (quoting  ISCR Case No. 02-01093 at 4 (App. Bd. \nDec. 11, 2003)); ISCR Case No. 05-02833 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2007) (citing Raffone v. Adams, 468 F.2d 860 \n(2nd Cir. 1972) (taken together, separate events may have a significance that is missing when each event is viewed \nin isolation). \n \n7 See ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. July 17, 2006) (stating that an analysis under the eighth APF \napparently without discussion of the other APFs was sustainable); ISCR Case No. 03-10954 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, \n2006) (sole APF mentioned is eighth APF); ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006) (remanding \ngrant of clearance because Judge did not assess \u201cthe realistic potential for exploitation\u201d), but see ISCR Case No. 04-\n00540 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007) (rejecting contention that eighth APF is exclusive circumstance in whole person \nanalysis in foreign influence cases). \n\n \n  \n \n11\nresist such overtures. Second, Applicant had significant connections to Taiwan before he \nemigrated to the U.S. in 1985 at age 27. He was born there and spent his formative years there. \nThird, he has immediate family members consisting of his mother and four siblings and in-laws, \nwho are residents and citizens of Taiwan. Fourth, Applicant has frequent and non-casual contact \nwith his immediate relatives as evidenced by his frequent telephone and e-mail contact as well as \nhis seven to eight visits to Taiwan since 1985. These contacts are manifestations of his strong \naffection and regard for his immediate family members, especially his mother. \n \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong presumption \nagainst granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . . it is deemed best to err \non the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by denying or revoking [a] \nclearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the \nwhole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign \ninfluence.  This is a close case, but ultimately the evidence leaves me with doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility and suitability. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d8 and supporting evidence, my \napplication of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my \nresponsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. \nFor the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFORMAL FINDINGS \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n        \n  \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nDECISION \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nRobert J.

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 6, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge LeRoy F.\nForeman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant has raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings\nwere supported by substantial evidence; and whether the Judge erred in failing to mitigate the\nGuideline F security concerns in her case.   Finding no error, we affirm.\n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant was discharged in\nChapter 7 bankruptcy in 1997.  The next year, due to her husband\u2019s job loss, Applicant filed for\nChapter 13 bankruptcy protection.  This was subsequently dismissed due to an improvement in\nApplicant\u2019s financial situation.  However, Applicant subsequently lost her job and her husband\u2019s\nbusiness suffered a downturn.

The\nJudge\u2019s material findings of security concern are supported by substantial record evidence.  See\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might\naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d)  The\nJudge properly concluded that Applicant\u2019s case raised security concerns under Guideline F.\nFurthermore, the Judge drew a \u201crational connection between the facts found\u201d and his conclusion that\nneither the Guideline F mitigating conditions nor the whole-person factors support a decision\nfavorable to Applicant.

The Judge\u2019s decision reflects that he considered the entire record, including the\nevidence favorable to Applicant.

On August 22, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision \ndeny her application, citing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations).  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 2, 2007, and answered it \non September 10, 2007.  On September 24, 2007, she requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on October 10, \n2007. The case was assigned to an administrative judge on October 15, 2007, and \nreassigned to me on October 24, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November \n1, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on November 15, 2007.  Government \nFebruary 6, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without objection.  Applicant \ntestified on her own behalf, presented the testimony of one witness, and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through T, which were admitted without objection. I granted \nApplicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until December 7, 2007 to enable her to \nsubmit additional matters.  At her request, I extended the time until January 18, 2007.  \nApplicant\u2019s two requests for additional time and my responses are attached to the \nrecord as Hearing Exhibit (HX) II.  Applicant timely submitted AX U, and it was admitted \nwithout objection. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AX U is attached to the record as \nHearing Exhibit III.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 13, \n2007. The record closed on January 18, 2008.  Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nProcedural Issue\u2014Notice of Hearing \n \nThe hearing was convened within 15 days of the written notice of hearing.  I \nadvised Applicant of her right under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8 to written notice 15 days before \nthe hearing.  She affirmatively waived her right to 15 days notice. (HX I; Tr. at 20-21.)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations and \noffered explanations.  Her admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old configuration/data manager for a federal contractor (Tr. \n95). She has worked for her current employer since February 2006. Her current \nsupervisor described her as extremely reliable, a self-starter, direct, street-smart, and \ndemonstrating strong situational leadership skills (AX B).   \n \nApplicant has an associate\u2019s degree in computer information science.  While \nworking for her current employer, she has completed several professional development \ncourses (AX E, F, and G), and she has received a cash award and several certificates \nfor her exceptional performance of duty (AX D). She held a security clearance from \n1990 to 1997, which was administratively terminated when she changed jobs. She does \nnot currently hold a clearance (Tr. 10). \n \n \nApplicant is married and has three children, a 20-year-old son, a 16-year-old \ndaughter, and a 14-year-old daughter (Tr. 47).  All three children live at home (Tr. 48).  \nApplicant handles the finances for the family (Tr. 48, 82).   \n \nIn 1995, Applicant and her husband contracted to build a new house.  They sold \ntheir townhouse and leased an apartment for six months, the anticipated time for \nconstruction of the new house.  Their house was unexpectedly completed in about three \nmonths, requiring Applicant and her husband to begin making mortgage payments on \nthe new house while continuing to pay rent on the leased apartment for the remainder of \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthe lease term (Tr. 72-73).  At about the same time, Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s pay was cut \nby thirty percent when his employer\u2019s company was sold (AX A at 1; Tr. 74).   \n \nIn July 1996, Applicant was seriously injured in an automobile accident, had no \nmedical insurance, and was unable to work (AX A at 1; Tr. 74).  In April 1997, she and \nher husband filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, receiving a discharge in August \n1997 (GX 2).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband lost his job shortly after they received their bankruptcy \ndischarge (Tr. 77), leaving Applicant solely responsible for supporting the family.  Based \non their attorney\u2019s advice, they filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in November \n1998.  After the petition was filed, Applicant found a new job that increased her income \nby about ten percent, and her husband found work as a sub-contractor for a counter-top \ncompany.  Eight months later she was offered another job that increased her income by \nan additional thirteen percent.  She also took a second job for about four months (AX A \nat 2).  Based on the increases in their income, she and her husband asked their \nattorney to dismiss the Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  The case was dismissed in November \n1999 (GX 3). \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband became the principal sub-contractor for the counter-top \ncompany in 2003. He formed his own company, bought equipment, and hired \nemployees.  He earned a reputation for being honest, reliable, and devoted to his family \n(AX C). Unfamiliar with the tax laws, he reported the income of his company as personal \nincome on their joint return (Tr. 50).  He also caused accounting problems for the family \nby mingling business income and expenses with personal income and expenses (Tr. \n84).  The family account is now separated from the business account (Tr. 85, 96-97). \n \nApplicant was laid off in December 2004.  Her husband laid off some of his staff \nin January or February 2005 due to a business downturn, and he overspent on \npurchases of equipment and materials (Tr. 53-54). They fell behind on the federal \nincome taxes, and a tax lien for $30,219 was filed in March 2005 (GX 4).  A second tax \nlien for $8,261 was filed in December 2005 (GX 5).  After the liens were filed, they \nincurred additional unpaid tax debt of about $40,000, increasing their total tax debt to \nabout $86,000 for tax years 2003 through 2006 (Tr. 65). \n \n \nIn late 2004, Applicant and her husband hired a tax debt consulting agency to \nnegotiate a settlement of the federal tax debt, and they submitted an offer in \ncompromise to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in December 2005. Applicant found \na new job around February 2006 and reported the change in their financial status to the \nIRS.  Because of her increased income, the IRS rejected their offer in compromise (Tr. \n91-92).  They submitted a proposed installment agreement in October 2006 but \nreceived no response (AX M at 2). \n \n \nApplicant and her husband hired a tax lawyer around June 2007.  The lawyer \nsuggested a possibility of using the equity in their home to pay off part of the tax lien.  \nThe proposed plan was to refinance the home, pay off the first and second mortgages, \n\n \n4 \n \n \nnegotiate with the IRS to subordinate the tax liens to the new first mortgage, pay off part \nof the tax liens with the cash proceeds of the refinancing, and pay off the liens under a \nmonthly payment plan (GX 6 at 2).  This plan was expected to yield about $56,000 in \nhome equity that could be applied to the tax debt, leaving about $30,000 to be resolved \nthrough a negotiated payment plan (Tr. 65-66). \n \nBetween August and November 2007, in anticipation of the refinancing and IRS \npayment plan, they paid off two credit card balances of about $7,000 and $3,400, a car \nloan of about $12,000, and a small medical bill (AX T at 1-6). In October 2007, they also \nsold a truck from the counter-top business for $3,000 (AX T at 7). \n \nAs of the date of the hearing, the loan had been approved and they were \nawaiting a decision on the subordination agreement from the IRS (AX I, J, K; Tr. 64).  \nApplicant and her husband were anticipating a closing date on the refinancing within \ntwo weeks (Tr. 66).  However, the closing on the refinancing did not occur as \nanticipated.  Applicant and her husband were required to resubmit their loan application \nafter the hearing.  They subsequently qualified for a loan, but had not received a \ndecision on the IRS subordination agreement as of the date the record closed.  They \nwere, however, paying $500 per month on the tax lien (AX U). \n \n \nApplicant and her husband have hired a professional tax preparer to handle their \n2007 taxes, and they have set aside about $10,000 to pay their federal income taxes \n(AX R; Tr. 67-69).  Around August 2007, Applicant increased the income tax withholding \nfrom her income (AX S; Tr. 98). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current gross annual pay is about $80,000, and her husband earns \nbetween $80,000 and $90,000 annually (Tr. 98). Her husband\u2019s income fluctuates \ndepending on the demand for his services (Tr. 97).  Their monthly expenses are about \n$6,000 (Tr. 97).  They have a net monthly remainder of about $1,100 (Tr. 106).   \n \nApplicant and her husband currently pay $1,000 per month on the first mortgage \non their home and $400 on the second mortgage.  If the refinancing is completed, they \nexpect to pay about $1,600 per month on a single mortgage (Tr. 98).   \n \n \nEven after selling the truck and paying off one car loan, they still have three car \npayments per month.  Applicant has a 2005 Cadillac Escalade that she bought used, on \nwhich her monthly payment is $1,000.  Her husband has a work truck on which the \nmonthly payments are $440.  The monthly payment on their son\u2019s car is $550.  The loan \non their son\u2019s car is \u201cupside down,\u201d because the balance is greater than the value of the \ncar.  The car loan that was recently paid off also was \u201cupside down.\u201d  Applicant \nexplained that, because of their previous bankruptcy filings and resulting lower credit \nrating, they could not finance a car purchase without paying a high interest rate (Tr. 98-\n99). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nFrom January to October 2007, Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law and his children were \nin financial difficulty and lived with Applicant and her husband.  The additional residents \nin the house increased their utility and food expenses (Tr. 101). \n \n \nApplicant has six active credit card accounts, which are all current.  She pays \nmore than the minimum monthly payment, between $800 and $1,000 per month, but \ncarries a total balance between $10,000 and $20,000. These accounts also have higher \nrates of interest because of Applicant\u2019s credit history (Tr. 102-03).   \n \n \nApplicant and her husband have a family savings account with a balance of \nslightly less than $10,000, but no other assets other than the family household \nfurnishings and her husband\u2019s business equipment.  Neither she nor her husband has \nany retirement savings (Tr. 106-07).   \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . \n. . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether \nan individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person \naccess to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of \nDefense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. \nOr. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information.  This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \n\n \n6 \n \n \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.  The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-\n0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant petitioned for and received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \ndischarge in 1997 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and she petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in \nNovember 1998 and it was dismissed in November 1999 (SOR \u00b6 1.b).  It also alleges \ntwo unsatisfied federal tax liens filed against Applicant (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d).  The \nsecurity concern relating to Guideline F is set out in AG & 18: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal acts to generate funds.   \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case.  AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ Applicant\u2019s inability to pay her delinquent \ntaxes raises AG \u00b6 19(a).   \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is raised where there is Aindebtedness \ncaused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of \nwillingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt.@  The \nfirst prong of AG \u00b6 19(b) is raised because Applicant\u2019s purchase of a late model luxury \ncar during a time when she could not pay her taxes was \u201cirresponsible,\u201d and it \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncontributed to her inability to pay her delinquent taxes.  However the second prong is \nnot established because she has demonstrated willingness to pay the debt.   \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not meeting financial obligations.@ \nApplicant\u2019s financial history since 1997 raises this disqualifying condition.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent spending beyond one=s means, \nwhich may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high \ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@  The combination of Applicant\u2019s \nirresponsible purchase of a luxury car, pattern of \u201cupside down\u201d car loans, high credit \ncard debt, and delinquent tax debt raises AG \u00b6 19(e).  Until recently, they had five \nvehicles in the family, of which four were being financed and at least two were \u201cupside \ndown\u201d loans.  They carry a monthly credit card debt between $10,000 and $20,000.   \n \nAG \u00b6 19(g) is raised by Afailure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same.@  This disqualifying condition is \nnot raised because there is no evidence of failure to file income tax returns or fraudulent \nfiling.  The record reflects only a failure to pay the taxes due. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@  AG \u00b6 20(a).  This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong.  It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or Aso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@  If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d \n \n \nThe first prong (\u201cso long ago\u201d) is not established because Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ntaxes are still unresolved. The second prong (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) is not established \nbecause she has a history of financial problems, predating her Chapter 7 bankruptcy \ndischarge and extending through delinquent taxes for several years. The third prong \n(\u201cunlikely to recur\u201d) also is not established.  The tax debt arose because Applicant and \nher husband did not understand or prepare for the consequences of their treatment of \nthe income generated by her husband\u2019s business. They have since obtained the \nassistance of an accountant to manage the financial aspects of the business and a \nlawyer to negotiate a resolution of the tax debt.  While they have reduced the likelihood \n\n \n8 \n \n \nof further tax delinquencies, their unwise purchases, multiple high-interest loans, \nsignificant credit card debt, and the absence of a financial cushion militate against a \nconclusion that further delinquent debts are unlikely to recur.  Finally, the fourth prong \n(\u201cdoes not case doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d) is not established.  Applicant\u2019s decision to incur additional debt to buy a late-\nmodel luxury car while she was seriously behind on paying her federal income taxes \nand carrying significant high-interest debt from other purchases reflects a lack of \nfinancial discipline that causes me to doubt her good judgment.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) \nis not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@  AG \u00b6 20(b).  Both prongs, i.e. conditions beyond the \npersons=s control and responsible conduct, must be established. \n \n \nThe events preceding Applicant\u2019s 1997 bankruptcy, i.e., the unexpected early \ncompletion of their home, her husband\u2019s pay cut, her injuries in an automobile accident \nand inability to work, and her uninsured medical expenses, all were beyond her control.  \nShe and her husband tried to discharge their obligations, sought legal advice, and \ndetermined that a Chapter 7 bankruptcy was the best course of action.  The event \npreceding Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, i.e., her husband\u2019s loss of \nemployment, also was beyond her control.  The later decision to dismiss the bankruptcy \nafter her husband found a new job and she received several pay raises was reasonable.  \nI conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is established for the two bankruptcies alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b. \n \n \nThe business mistakes made by Applicant\u2019s husband were arguably a \ncircumstance beyond her control, because she did not involve herself in her husband\u2019s \nbusiness.  However, she managed the household accounts and knew her husband was \nmingling the accounts.  She filed a joint return with her husband reflecting his business \nincome as personal income, and she knew the amount of taxes they owed.  \nFurthermore, she did not respond reasonably to the consequences of her husband\u2019s \nbusiness mistakes.  She purchased a luxury car and obligated herself to make monthly \npayments of $1,000 on the car at a time when they could not afford to pay their taxes.  I \nconclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is not established for the tax liens alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. and 1.d. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@  AG \u00b6 20(c).  \nApplicant and her husband hired a tax debt consulting agency and a tax lawyer to \nresolve their delinquent income tax debt.  Their lawyer devised a plan, but it has not \nbeen executed and the IRS has not agreed to the plan\u2019s key components, the \nsubordination of its liens to the first mortgage on the home, and an installment payment \n\n \n9 \n \n \nplan.  Thus, the problem is not yet being resolved or under control.  I conclude AG \u00b6 \n20(c) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@  AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@  ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  \nEvidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under \npressure of qualifying for a security clearance.   \n \nApplicant began working or her current employer in February 2006 and submitted \nher SF 86 during the same month.  Her efforts to resolve the tax debts began two years \nbefore she applied for a security clearance.  Clearly, her efforts were not prompted by \nthe pressure of qualifying for a security clearance.   \n \nApplicant and her husband have worked very hard to negotiate a settlement of \nthe delinquent tax debt, but at the same time they continued to incur new debts.  They \nhave done little to scale back their lifestyle and generate additional funds to pay their \ntaxes.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nThe correspondence from Applicant\u2019s tax attorney (AX J and K) indicates that a \nsecurity clearance is essential for her to retain her current position and an essential part \nof her solution to her tax problem.  However, the Appeal Board has made it clear that \n\u201cthe consequences to an applicant\u2019s career and the financial well-being of [herself] or \n[her] family are not a relevant consideration in an adjudication of an applicant\u2019s security \neligibility.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-09220 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 28, 2004). \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nIn addition to her tax debt, Applicant is carrying a significant balance on six credit \ncards and paying three car loans.  Her largest car debt is for her Cadillac Escalade.  Her \nhusband\u2019s income fluctuates with the economy.  She and her husband are supporting \nthree children, two of high school age.  They appear to have been living near their \nfinancial limits for several years.  They have a small savings account and no retirement \nsavings, leaving them with a minimal financial cushion for unexpected expenses and \nmaking further delinquent debts likely.  Although they were optimistic at the hearing that \na solution to their tax problem was imminent, they were unable to reach a solution by \nthe time the record closed more than two months later. \n \n \nApplicant presented herself at the hearing as an exceptionally talented, \narticulate, energetic person. I found her testimony candid and credible.  Her supervisor \ndescribes her in glowing terms both as an employee and as a person.  Unfortunately, \nshe is a deep financial hole, due to a combination of some circumstances beyond her \ncontrol and her own financial indiscipline. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by her Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 1997 \nand her Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition that was dismissed in November 1999, but she \nhas not mitigated the security concerns raised by the unsatisfied federal tax liens.  Her \nsituation may improve over time, but on this record and as of this date I must conclude \nshe has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information.  See ISCR Case No. \n99-0901, 2000 WL 288429 at *3 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000) (administrative judge lacks \nauthority to grant a conditional or probationary security clearance); but see Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.37 through E3.1.39 (reconsideration authorized after one year).  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial): \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn August 23, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. This action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD\nDirective 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended. He answered the SOR on\nSeptember 24, 2007, admitting the allegations. He originally requested a hearing, and\nlater elected to have the case decided on the written record.\nDepartment Counsel mailed the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) to\nApplicant on November 28, 2007. He received it on December 3, 2007. Applicant was\nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation. He did not object to any of the FORM submissions, and filed an undated\ntwo-page response. The case was assigned to me on December 14, 2007.Based upon\na review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFebruary 15, 2008\n\n2\nRulings of Evidence\nAt department counsel\u2019s request, I took administrative notice of the following\nfacts about Pakistan:\n1. Pakistan is home to a number of extremist groups, including the Taliban and\nAl-Qaeda, that target American and other Western interests, high-level Pakistani\ngovernment officials, and members of indigenous minority and religious groups (Item 8,\nat 2-5),\n2. Because of this continuing danger, the U.S. Department of State, in December\n2006, imposed a travel warning for U.S. citizens intending to travel to Pakistan (Item\n10),\n3. Pakistan has a poor human rights record. Security forces have, at times,\ntortured people in custody, politically motivated disappearances are common, and the\njudiciary is not independent (See Generally, Item 9), and,\n4. Pakistan has supplied nuclear technology to other countries (Item 11 at 2, 7).\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admits to the SOR allegations. He is a 51-year-old married man with\nthree children, ages 12, 14, and 16. He is originally from Pakistan, and has been a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen since 1996. He emigrated to the U.S. in approximately 1986\n(Response to FORM, undated). He earned an undergraduate degree in mechanical\nengineering from a Pakistani university in 1984. In 1987, he earned a master\u2019s of\nbusiness administration from an American university. Since then, he has also earned\nseveral information technology certifications (Item 5 at 2). Currently, he works as a\nsystem administrator for a defense contractor.\nApplicant\u2019s mother and father-in-law are citizens and residents of Pakistan. His\nfather and his mother-in-law are deceased. His mother is a homemaker. He talks to her\nby telephone approximately once per week. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is a journalist who\nlives in the same neighborhood as Applicant\u2019s mother (Item 6 at 6). He visits both when\nhe travels to Pakistan. There is no record evidence of any phone contact between\nApplicant and his father-in-law.\nApplicant has five brothers and three sisters. One brother is a naturalized\nGerman citizen and resident. The remaining siblings are all Pakistani citizens and\nresidents. Of the four brothers living in Pakistan, one is a retired military official, and the\nothers are a retired police official, a retired city employee, and an electrical engineer,\nrespectively (Item 6 at 6). All of his sisters are homemakers. He talks to his siblings\napproximately two to three times per year.\n\n3\nApplicant traveled to Pakistan in 1998, 2001, and 2004 to visit family members.\nIn 1998, he traveled alone. He brought his family on the latter two trips. On each trip, he\nstayed with either his mother or his father-in-law.\nWhen Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1996, he initially renounced\nhis Pakistani citizenship. In November 2005, he decided to reinstate his dual citizenship\nstatus so that he could travel to Pakistan quickly in case of a family emergency. That\nmonth, he applied for, and received a Pakistani passport. It remains valid through 2009\n(Item 6 at 5). \nApplicant would renounce his dual citizenship, if asked (Item 6 at 5). All of his\nfinancial interests are in the U.S. His children were born and raised in the U.S.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\n\n4\nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder this guideline, \u201cwhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a\npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United\nStates\u201d (AG \u00b6 9). Here, Applicant\u2019s application for a passport issued by the government\nof Pakistan, nine years after he became a naturalized U.S. citizen, triggers the\napplication of AG \u00b6 10(a)(1), \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember [such as] possession of a current foreign passport.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s willingness to renounce his Pakistani citizenship, if asked, triggers the\napplication of AG \u00b6 11(b), \u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual\ncitizenship.\u201d \nApplicant still possesses a passport issued by Pakistan, and has presented no\nevidence that its possession is approved by the cognizant security authority. Therefore,\nneither AG \u00b6 11(d), \u201cuse of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security\nauthority,\u201d or AG \u00b6 11(e), \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the\ncognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated,\u201d apply. Also, none of the other\nmitigating conditions apply, either.\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if\nan individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interests.\u201d Here,\nPakistan is a haven for extremist, anti-American groups, and has a history of abusing its\ncitizens\u2019 human rights. The presence of Applicant\u2019s relatives in Pakistan, and his\ncontacts with them generates concerns under AG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family\nmember, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of\nor resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, or coercion.\u201d\n\n5\nAlthough Applicant has visited his siblings on each trip to Pakistan, he only talks\nto them two or three times per year. Moreover, since emigrating to the United States in\n1986, he has only traveled to Pakistan three times. However, neither AG \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.,\u201d nor AG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation,\u201d apply. Regardless of how often he talks to his siblings or other relatives,\nApplicant is clearly close to them, as demonstrated by his decision to obtain a Pakistani\npassport to facilitate visits on short notice in the event of a family emergency. Morever,\nthe government of Pakistan demonstrates little respect for the rights of its citizens, and\nterrorists are active in several parts of the country. Under these circumstances, the\npositions or activities of the relatives has little probative value in gauging the likelihood of\nwhether they may be used against Applicant as tools of exploitation.\nApplicant has deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. These\ncannot overcome the potential for coercion generated by his relationship to family\nmembers in Pakistan given the depth of their relationship, the nature of the Pakistani\ngovernment, and the pervasive presence of anti-American extremist groups. Applicant\nhas not mitigated the foreign influence security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the\nultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an\noverall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and\nthe whole person concept.\nApplicant\u2019s longstanding ties to the U.S. are outweighed by his decision to\nexercise dual citizenship with Pakistan, a police state that harbors anti-American\nextremist groups, in order to facilitate visits to his Pakistani relatives. Upon evaluating\nthis case in the context of the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns. Clearance is denied.\n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The Applicant is 42 years old and married. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Senior Technical Specialist, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant has been married three times and divorced twice. As a result, he became indebted from the expenses of the marriages as well as from the costs of the divorces. In 1989, he married his first wife and they had two children. They separated in 1998. In addition to his other bills, that included a credit union loan for $15,000.00, the court ordered that he pay temporary child and alimony support of $2,400 a month.

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nOctober 30, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-86), on\nAugust 28, 2007.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On May 30, 2008, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 25, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.   This Administrative Judge was assigned the\nmatter on July 22, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on August 12, 2008,\nscheduling the hearing for October 2, 2008.  The Government offered sixteen exhibits\nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 16, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted no exhibits. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 14, 2008.  Based upon a review\nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 42 years old and married.  He is employed by a defense\ncontractor as a Senior Technical Specialist, and is applying for a security clearance in\nconnection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant has been married three times and divorced twice.  As a result, he\nbecame indebted from the expenses of the marriages as well as from the costs of the\ndivorces.  In 1989, he married his first wife and they had two children.  They separated\nin 1998.  In addition to his other bills, that included a credit union loan for $15,000.00,\nthe court ordered that he pay temporary child and alimony support of $2,400 a month.\nThe Applicant fell behind on the loan payments and struggled to pay his living\nexpenses.  The child and alimony support amount was eventually reduced, but he still\nhad financial difficulties making ends meet.  In 2002/2003, he married his second wife.\nThey incurred debt, and divorced in 2004.  He married his current wife in 2005.     \nCredit reports of the Applicant dated March 28, 2003, September 24, 2001, April\n3, 2007, May 5, 2008 and July 22, 2008 indicate that the delinquent debts set forth in\nthe SOR remain delinquent and owing.  (Government Exhibits 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6). \nIn regard to the credit union loan for $15,000.00, the Applicant believes that his\nex-wife may have paid it, but he is not sure.  \nIn 2002, the Applicant became indebted to a creditor in the amount of $55.00.\nThis debt remains outstanding.  (Tr. p. 36).  A delinquent debt owed to another creditor\nin the amount of $138.00 also remains outstanding.  (Tr. p. 41).   \nIn order to cover some of his expenses for gas and groceries, in July 2004, the\nApplicant used his company credit card to make unauthorized personal purchases.  He\nwas suspended for three days without pay because of his misuse of the company credit\ncard.\nThe Applicant listed a delinquent credit card debt in the amount of $300.00 on his\nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions.  He stated that it no longer appears on his\ncredit report so he believes that it has been paid.  (Tr. p. 43).\nWhen asked whether he has any other delinquent debts, the Applicant added\nthat he has an outstanding tax debt in the amount of about $1,300.00.  His wife is\ncurrently paying the debt in the amount of $75.00 a month which comes out of her\nsocial security check she receives for disability.  \nParagraph 2 (Guideline - M - Use of Information Technology). The Government alleges\nthat the Applicant is ineligible for a security clearance because noncompliance with\nrules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining to information technology\nsystems may raise security concerns about his reliability and trustworthiness, calling\n\n3\ninto question his willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks,\nand information.  \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because of his questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\nFrom 2004, until at least February 2005, the Applicant used his company\ncomputer to view inappropriate Web sites on the internet.  The sites included pictures of\nwoman in bikinis, lingerie, partially undressed and with their breasts and genitals\nexposed.  This was a violation of company policy.  In July 2004, the Applicant was\nadmonished by his manager for using a company computer to view these inappropriate\nWeb sites on the internet.  (Government Exhibit 9).  However, he continued to view the\ninappropriate sites.  The Applicant testified that he knew it was wrong and was aware of\nthe company policies, the Code of Conduct and the Sexual Harassment policy that\nprohibited such conduct.  Following the investigation of this matter, the Applicant was\nterminated from his employment.  (Government Exhibits 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 and\n16). He testified, however, that he did not know that it would adversely affect his\nsecurity clearance.  He sincerely regrets what he did, and believes that he has learned\nhis lesson.  He states that he will never engage in this misconduct again.    \nAs discussed above, the Applicant also misused his corporate credit card in July\n2004 to purchase groceries and gas because he ran short on cash that particular\nmonth.  The bill reflects that there were 34 charges made by the Applicant that were not\nbusiness-related expenses, but were for his own personal use.  (Government Exhibit 8).\nThe Applicant stated that he paid the bill as soon as he received it.  (Tr. p. 45).  The\nApplicant expressed that he will never engage in this misconduct again.  He currently\nhas an American Express credit card that was issued as a corporate Government card\nand he will not touch it.  (Tr. p. 46).\n \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\n\n4\nalso a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19.(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline M (Use of Information Technology)\n39.  The Concern.  Noncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations\npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness or ability\nto properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and information.  Information\nTechnology Systems include all related computer hardware, software, firmware, and\ndata used of the communication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage,\nprotection of information. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n40.(a) illegal or unauthorized entry into any information technology system or\ncomponent thereof;\n40.(e) unauthorized use of a government or other information technology system.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under ant other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which,\nwhen combined with all available information supports a whole person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\n\n5\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information.  This includes but is not limited to\nconsideration of:\n16.(d)(2) disruptive, violent or inappropriate behavior in the workplace;\n16.(d)(3)  pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the\nfollowing general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\n\n6\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in financial irresponsibility, misuse of information technology\nand rule violations that demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in financial irresponsibility (Guideline F), use of information\ntechnology (Guideline M), and personal conduct (Guideline E).  The totality of this\nevidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the\nApplicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there\nis a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines F, M and E of the SOR.\nThe evidence shows that the Applicant has incurred a number of delinquent\ndebts that he has simply ignored.  Granted, his marriages and divorces have been\ncostly, however, even so, his delinquent debts are not so excessive to prevent him from\ndoing something to demonstrate a showing of good faith or an effort to resolve them.\nHe has not done anything.  Under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying\nConditions 19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and 19.(c) a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations are applicable.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.\nThe Applicant has not made a good faith effort to resolve his indebtedness.  His\nfinancial problems have not been resolved and they remain owing.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline F, Financial Considerations.\n \nWith respect to the Applicant\u2019s misuse of his company credit card in July 2004,\nfor which his pay was suspended for three days, and the misuse of the company\ncomputer, from 2004 through February 2005, by viewing inappropriate Web sites, for\nwhich he was terminated from his employment, the misconduct demonstrates a pattern\nof poor judgment under Guidelines M (Use of Information Technology) and E, (Personal\n\n7\nConduct) that is fairly recent and very troubling.  Under Guideline M, Disqualifying\nConditions 40(a) illegal or unauthorized entry into any information technology stem or\ncomponent thereof, and 40(e) unauthorized use of a government or other information\ntechnology system apply.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  Under\nGuideline E, Disqualifying Conditions 16(d)(2) disruptive, violent or inappropriate\nbehavior in the workplace, and 16(d)(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations also\napply.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. Consequently, his poor\njudgment adversely effects his security clearance eligibility.  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant is 42 years old, but has\nconducted himself in a very immature and irresponsible manner.  Under the particular\nfacts of this case, the totality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed\nas a whole, support a whole person assessment of questionable judgement,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard classified information.     \nThis Applicant has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does not meet\nthe eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations), M, Use of\nInformation Technology and E (Personal Conduct). \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 are found against the Applicant.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \nParagraph 3: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n8\n    Subpara.  3.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except subparagraph 1.a. He is a 45-year-old married man with four children ranging in age from 3 to 13. He works for a defense contractor as a software engineer, and he has a Ph.D in electrical engineering earned in 1994. Applicant emigrated to the United States from Lebanon in 1983 to attend college. He lived in the United States on a student visa from 1983 to 1994. After earning his 3 doctorate, he obtained a worker visa which he held from 1994 to 1997. He obtained permanent resident status in 1997, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2003. (Tr. 45). Although Applicant was born and raised in Lebanon, he has never been a Lebanese citizen. Lebanese law through approximately 1995 prevented anyone who either was not born in Lebanon or whose parents were not born in Lebanon from holding Lebanese citizenship (Exhibit 3 at 1). Because both parents were born in Syria, Applicant held Syrian citizenship through childhood, and emigrated to the United States as a Syrian citizen. Currently, he is a dual citizen with Syria and the U.S. Applicant\u2019s parents and three of his siblings (two brothers and a sister) live in Lebanon. Another sibling is a naturalized U.S. citizen and resident. All of the siblings living in Lebanon are Syrian citizens.

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn June 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines C and B.\nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 15, 2007, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on November 19, 2007.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 21, 2007, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on December 11, 2007. During the hearing, I received three government\nexhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on\nDecember 19, 2007. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nJanuary 28, 2008\n\n2\nRuling on Evidence\nAt department counsel\u2019s request, I took administrative notice of several relevant\nadjudicative facts about Syria and Lebanon. These facts are encapsulated in 19 source\ndocuments admitted into the record. They are, generally, as follows:\n1. The State Department has designated Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism. A\nnumber of the terrorist groups that have offices in Syria oppose U.S. policies in the\nMiddle East, and have the ability and intent to undermine American interests (Exhibit II\nat 2, Exhibit III at 1);\n2. Syria has a poor human rights record. Abuses include lack of fair public trials,\narbitrary arrests and detention, and severe restrictions on civil liberties (see generally,\nExhibit V);\n3. Syrian security forces have at times monitored its citizens\u2019 telephone\nconversations, fax transmissions, and mail addressed to both citizens and foreign\nresidents (Exhibit V at 9);\n4. On May 11, 2004, President Bush signed an executive order implementing\nsanctions against Syria prohibiting the export to Syria of any products other than food\nand medicine (Exhibit II at 4);\n5. Syria has a compulsory military service requirement for all male citizens over\nage 18. This requirement applies to non-resident citizens unless they pay a $2,000\nexemption fee (Exhibit II at 4);\n6. Militias and non-Lebanese forces operating outside of Lebanon\u2019s central\ngovernment authority frequently violated citizen\u2019s privacy rights (Exhibit XV at 5);\n7. Hezbollah, the most technically proficient terrorist group in the world, maintains\noffices in Lebanon, has official liaison officers to the Lebanese security services, and is\nrepresented by elected deputies in the Lebanese parliament (Exhibit 9 at 9); and,\n8. The U.S. remains concerned about the threat of terrorist attacks against\nWestern interests in Lebanon. (Exhibit X at 1). \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except\nsubparagraph 1.a. He is a 45-year-old married man with four children ranging in age\nfrom 3 to 13. He works for a defense contractor as a software engineer, and he has a\nPh.D in electrical engineering earned in 1994.\nApplicant emigrated to the United States from Lebanon in 1983 to attend college.\nHe lived in the United States on a student visa from 1983 to 1994. After earning his\n\n3\ndoctorate, he obtained a worker visa which he held from 1994 to 1997. He obtained\npermanent resident status in 1997, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2003. (Tr.\n45).\nAlthough Applicant was born and raised in Lebanon, he has never been a\nLebanese citizen. Lebanese law through approximately 1995 prevented anyone who\neither was not born in Lebanon or whose parents were not born in Lebanon from\nholding Lebanese citizenship (Exhibit 3 at 1). Because both parents were born in Syria,\nApplicant held Syrian citizenship through childhood, and emigrated to the United States\nas a Syrian citizen. Currently, he is a dual citizen with Syria and the U.S. \nApplicant\u2019s parents and three of his siblings (two brothers and a sister) live in\nLebanon. Another sibling is a naturalized U.S. citizen and resident. All of the siblings\nliving in Lebanon are Syrian citizens. In approximately 1995, after Lebanese law\nchanged to allow longtime residents to obtain Lebanese citizenship, his parents and two\nbrothers applied for and obtained it (Exhibit 3 at 1, Tr. 29). His sister\u2019s application is\npending and she remains solely a Syrian citizen. \nApplicant\u2019s father owns a carpentry factory, and his mother is a homemaker (Tr.\n41). He talks to them approximately once every two weeks (Tr. 48). Since emigrating to\nthe U.S. in 1983, he has returned to Lebanon to visit them six times (Id.). The most\nrecent visits occurred in 2005 and 2006. In 1994 and 2003, Applicant\u2019s parents visited\nhim in the U.S.\nTwo of Applicant\u2019s brothers living in Lebanon manage the carpentry factory. The\nremaining brother living in Lebanon owns a pool-and-patio store, and his sister is a\nhigh-school teacher (Tr. 52).\nApplicant has only seen his siblings living in Lebanon 4 times in 14 years. They\ndo not exchange e-mail correspondence or holiday cards. The only time he talks to\nthem is if any happen to be visiting their parents\u2019 house when he calls (Tr. 49, Exhibit 3\nat 9).\nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in Kuwait and raised in Syria (Tr. 46). She became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen in 2004.\nBoth of Applicant\u2019s in-laws live in Syria. His father-in-law is retired, and his\nmother-in-law is a homemaker (Tr. 54). The father-in-law retired years before Applicant\nmet his wife. Applicant does not know what he did for a living before retiring (Id.). He\ntalks to them approximately once every three to six months (Tr. 55, Exhibit 3 at 5). They\nhave visited his family in the U.S. on past occasions.\nApplicant has travelled to Syria on four occasions. He and is wife wed in Syria in\n1992, and they returned in 2000, 2005 and 2006. These trips corresponded to trips to\nLebanon.\n\n4\nAll of Applicant\u2019s children were born and raised in the U.S. All of his social ties\nexcluding his family are in the U.S. (Tr. 67).\nBefore Applicant became a U.S. citizen, he used a Syrian passport for travel to\nboth Lebanon and Syria. It expired in 2001, and he has not renewed it (Tr. 28). Since\nthen, Applicant has used his U.S. passport exclusively when traveling internationally.\nSOR subparagraph 1.c alleges Applicant told a DoD investigator in February\n2006 that he maintains his Syrian citizenship to facilitate travel to Syria to visit relatives.\nThere is no February 2006 signed, sworn statement in the record evidence. An\ninvestigative agent raised this issue in a May 2007 interview. Applicant, in a signed,\nsworn statement, responded as follows:\n[the investigative agent] informed me . . .that I had stated I maintained my\ncitizenship with Syria to make it easier to travel and visit relatives. . . I\ncan\u2019t explain [this] statement. . . Any red tape associated with carrying a\nU.S. passport is negligible. . . Since acquiring it, it is the only document\nused for all of my trips.\nIn his Answer, Applicant reiterated the explanation given in his May 2007 signed, sworn\nstatement, and asserted that SOR subparagraph 1.b was a mischaracterization of his\nFebruary 2006 statement.\nIn 2005, Applicant paid the Syrian government a $2,000 fee to waive its\ncompulsory military service requirement (Tr. 40). He did so because he did not want this\nissue to present a problem if he returned in the future to visit his wife\u2019s family (Tr. 40).\nAnalysis\nForeign Preference\nUnder this guideline, \u201c[w]hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a\npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United\nStates (AG \u00b6 9). \nHere, the government did not establish that Applicant exercises dual citizenship\nwith Syria and the U.S., as alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.a. For subparagraph 1.b, I\ndo not conclude that Applicant\u2019s decision to pay the Syrian government an exemption\nfee to waive its compulsory military service requirement is indicative of a preference for\nSyria. Instead, this action constitutes persuasive supporting evidence of his contention,\nraised repeatedly throughout the hearing, that he has no preference for Syria.\nFor \nSOR \nsubparagraph \n1.c, \nApplicant \ncontends \nthe \ngovernment\nmischaracterized his statement made to a DoD agent in 2006. Absent either testimony\n\n5\nfrom the interviewing agent, or a signed, sworn copy of the alleged 2006 statement, I\nconclude the government failed to establish SOR subparagraph 1.c. \nNone of the foreign preference disqualifying conditions apply. I conclude there\nare no foreign preference security concerns.\nForeign Influence\nUnder this adjudicative guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests may be a\nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may\nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government\nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any\nforeign interest.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6). Here, Applicant\u2019s parents and four siblings are dual\nLebanese/Syrian citizens who reside in Lebanon, and his in-laws are Syrian citizens and\nresidents. These relationships raise the issue of whether AG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a\nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who\nis a citizen of, or resident in foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d applies. \nThe government presented no evidence that Lebanon is specifically targeting\nU.S. citizens to obtain protected information. In evaluating the potential for coercion,\nhowever, the risk of terrorism within a foreign country is a relevant consideration\nindependent of whether it is known to target U.S. citizens (See generally, ISCR Case\nNo. 05-11292, April 12, 2007). Hezbollah and other terrorist/paramilitary groups have a\npervasive influence on Lebanese politics and civil society. This severely undercuts the\nability its central government to preserve the rule of law. AG \u00b6 7(a) applies to Applicant\u2019s\nrelationship with his family members who are Lebanese citizens and residents.\nMany of Lebanon\u2019s problems stem from Syria, an authoritarian country that\nsupports terrorism and foments political unrest in Lebanon to advance its geopolitical\nobjectives. AG \u00b6 7(a) also applies to Applicant\u2019s relationship with his in-laws living in\nSyria.\nApplicant\u2019s rare communication over the years with his siblings living in Lebanon\ntriggers the application of AG \u00b6 8 (c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is\nso casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\u201d Conversely, Applicant remains close to his parents. Moreover,\nalthough he talks to his in-laws infrequently, he has visited them on each of his past\nthree trips to the region. AG \u00b6 8 (c) does not apply to these relationships.\nThe remaining mitigating conditions that are potentially applicable to Applicant\u2019s\nrelationships with his foreign relatives are AG \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships with\nthe foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or\nactivities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual,\ngroup, organization, or government, and the interests of the U.S.,\u201d and AG \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere\n\n6\nis no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to\nthe foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has\nsuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply to Applicant\u2019s relationship with his parents. Their close\nrelationship, in conjunction with the heightened risk posed by Lebanon, renders the first\ntwo prongs of AG \u00b6 8(a) inapplicable. The third prong is also inapplicable. Neither\nterrorists nor authoritarian governments would be likely to have any qualms about\npressuring individuals to extort sensitive or protected information. Consequently, their\npositions or activities within Lebanon have little probative value. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is similarly inapplicable to Applicant\u2019s relationship with his in-laws.\nAlthough he does not speak with them often, his wife does, and the family has traveled\nto Syria to visit them on each of the past three trips to the region. Moreover, as the\nsource of many of Lebanon\u2019s internal problems, Syria represents a greater risk to U.S.\ninterests than does Lebanon. \nApplicant has lived in the U.S. for 24 years, earning two advanced degrees\nduring that time. His children were born in the U.S. and his social ties are all in the U.S.\nThese ties are not sufficient enough to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 8(b). As country\u2019s\nthat are either terrorist havens or police states that actively support terrorists, the types\nof conflict of interests Applicant may encounter could conceivably have life-threatening\nconsequences for his family. Under these circumstances, the depth of his loyalties and\nlongstanding relationships in the U.S. does not outweigh any potential conflict of interest\nhe may encounter.\nSubparagraph 1.c does not represent a foreign influence security concern for the\nsame reason it does not represent a foreign preference security concern (See Foreign\nPreference section of analysis, supra). \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nI was impressed with Applicant\u2019s sense of familial obligation to his parents and\nhis in-laws. Positive attributes can be exploited by foreign countries as readily as\n\n7\nnegative ones, however. Although he has longstanding relationships and ties in the\nU.S., they are insufficient to overcome the potential to vulnerability created by his\nrelatives living in Lebanon and Syria. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d -2.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

After\nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary\naffirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\n1\nApplicant\u2019s request. On July 27, 2007, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns addressed in the Revised\nMarch 31,2008\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an\nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\n See, Section E3.1.17 of the Directive\u2019s Enclosure 3.\n3\n2\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline F (financial considerations) and\n2\nGuideline E (personal conduct).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on November 1, 2007. After consulting with the parties and taking into\nconsideration pre-existing schedules, I scheduled a hearing to be held on January 22,\n2008. The parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented six exhibits (Gx.\n1 - 6). Applicant testified in his own behalf, offered 28 exhibits (Ax. A - BB), and\npresented five witnesses. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 30, 2008.\nProcedural Issues\n1. On November 28, 2007, Applicant requested that the testimony of one of his\nwitnesses be taken by telephone. Department Counsel objected on grounds doing so\nwould hinder an assessment of the witness\u2019s credibility. After hearing from the parties in\na telephone conference call on December 6, 2007, I granted Applicant\u2019s request. My\nruling is included in the Pre-Hearing Order, dated December 7, 2007, included in the\nrecord as Judicial Exhibit (Jx.) I. In making my ruling, I relied on the provisions of\nSections E3.1.9 (The Administrative Judge may require a pre-hearing conference) and\nE3.1.10 (The Administrative Judge may rule on questions on (sic) procedure, discovery,\nand evidence, and shall conduct all hearings in a fair, timely, and orderly manner) of the\nDirective\u2019s Enclosure 3, and on Rule 611(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence (The court\nshall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses\nand presenting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective\nfor the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3)\nprotect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.)\n2. The allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b originally alleged Applicant had\ndeliberately falsified his answers to question 28 (\u201cYour Financial Delinquencies - 180\nDays\u201d) and question 29 (\u201cYour Financial Delinquencies - 90 Days\u201d), respectively, in the\nSF 86 he submitted on June 16, 2005. A review of that document (Gx. 1) showed the\nallegations correctly quoted the language from SF 86 questions 38 and 39, respectively.\nAccordingly, after the parties completed their cases in chief, I amended the SOR sua\nsponte to conform to the evidence  by striking the inaccurate question numbers from\n3\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b and replacing them with the correct question numbers. (Tr. 263 -\n264)\n\n3\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the government alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.g that Applicant\nwas delinquent on seven debts totaling $11,266, six of which (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d, 1.f, 1.g)\nhad been referred to collection agencies as long ago as December 2003. The debt\nlisted in SOR \u00b6 1.e was allegedly charged off as a business loss in July 2005. The\ngovernment also alleged Applicant had not acted to resolve his debt despite the fact a\nPersonal Financial Statement (PFS) he submitted in May 2007 showed a positive\nmonthly cash flow in excess of $1,200 (SOR 1.h)\nUnder Guideline E, the government alleged that, on June 16, 2005, Applicant\ndeliberately withheld from the government the delinquent debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a -\n1.d when he answered \u201cno\u201d in response to SF 86 question 38 (\u201cYour Financial\nDifficulties - 180 Days. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on\nany debt(s)\u201d) (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and SF 86 question 39 ((\u201cYour Financial Difficulties - 90 Days.\nAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)\u201d) (SOR \u00b6 2.b).\nIn response, Applicant admitted with explanation the SOR \u00b6 1.d allegation of a\ndelinquent Citibank credit card debt for $7,402. He denied with explanation the\nremaining allegations. Applicant\u2019s testimony at hearing was straightforward, credible,\nand offered without reservation. After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and\nexhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is 42 years old and has been employed by a defense contractor since\nJanuary 2004 as a Training Specialist (Gx 1). In 1984, he enlisted in the U.S. Army\nNational Guard, but transferred in 1987 to the U.S. Air Force, where he served until\nbeing honorably discharged for medical reasons in 1999 as a staff sergeant (paygrade\nE-5). He has an associate\u2019s degree in electronics he received while in the Air Force.\nApplicant was married from August 1988 until June 2004, when he and his ex-wife\ndivorced. Their two children, ages 13 and 8, live with his ex-wife.\nWhile they were married, Applicant\u2019s wife worked outside the home until medical\nproblems starting in April 1994 and continuing for several years thereafter limited her\nability to bring in money to supplement Applicant\u2019s income. In 2003, Applicant was laid\noff from the defense contractor he worked for. He was unemployed for about a year\nbefore obtaining his current job. Combined with his wife\u2019s limited earning ability, his\nunemployment soon led to unpaid debts.\nApplicant and his ex-wife separated in June 2004. (Gx. 1) In December 2004,\nthey sold their marital residence and netted approximately $73,000 in profit. They\nagreed that the proceeds would transfer to her account. It was further agreed she would\nuse the funds to pay off their marital debts and to support herself and the children\nthrough July 2005. Thereafter, Applicant was to receive 40% of any remaining\nproceeds. In the spring of 2005, he received $5,000 from his ex-wife. It was his\nunderstanding at the time that his wife had paid their debts as agreed. (Tr. 64 - 66, 195 -\n197)\n\n4\nApplicant has held a secret clearance since 1988 and held a top secret clearance\nbetween 1993 and 1999. He had a secret clearance when he was hired for his current\njob, but he submitted an SF 86 on June 16, 2005, because his employer wanted him to\nbe eligible to work on other contracts. In response to all of the SF 86 questions seeking\nadverse information about his finances he answered \u201cno.\u201d (Gx. 1) He was unaware of\nany delinquent debts for which he was responsible after the divorce, and thought at the\ntime he completed the questionnaire his wife had paid their old debts. Applicant and his\nwife had continued to communicate about their finances after the divorce and there was\nno indication their debts had not been resolved. (Tr., 202 - 204) In an affidavit submitted\nwith Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, his ex-wife confirmed their arrangement and\nclaimed she had paid off accounts with Citibank (SOR \u00b6 1.d), Kohl\u2019s (SOR \u00b6 1.e), Arrow\nServices (SOR \u00b6 1.a), AT&T (SOR \u00b6 1.g) in early 2005.\nThe debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1f are the same debt reported by\ndifferent collection agencies. In late 1996, Applicant paid $500 for a digital camera\nthrough a catalogue company. He returned the camera because it was defective and\npaid another $500 for a replacement. The company told him the account had been\ncredited $500 for the first camera. (Answer to the SOR) Applicant did not know of any\nreported delinquency until DOHA sent interrogatories about this and other debts in April\n2007. This debt has been paid and was removed from Applicant\u2019s credit history. (Ax. J)\nThe $1,504 delinquency listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a was for an unpaid medical account.\nApplicant thought his ex-wife had paid the account in 2005, but he contacted the\ncollection agency and paid the debt in August 2007 out of his own pocket to ensure a\nfinal  resolution of the debt. (Ax. I)\nThe $7,402 delinquency listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d was for an unpaid Citibank credit\ncard account. Despite his ex-wife\u2019s claim in her affidavit that she paid the account in\n2005, he contacted the collection agency after receiving the SOR and made\narrangements to repay the debt through mutually agreed monthly payments. (Ax. K)\nThe $600 debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e was paid in full on August 2007, (Ax. L) as was the\n$74 debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.g (Ax. M)\nIn response to a set of DOHA financial interrogatories, Applicant included a PFS\nthat showed he had a net monthly income of about $4,000. From this he pays about\n$2,800 in monthly expenses, including $1,280 in child support, but excluding any\npayments to the debts listed in the SOR. With one exception, all of the debts listed in\nthe SOR were paid within a month of receiving the interrogatories. Applicant has a\npositive cash flow of $1,200. (Gx. 2) He has two credit cards in his name. One is a\ncorporate card used for business-related expenses, the other is a personal credit card\nwhich he pays off each month. (Tr. 37 - 38; Ax. N - P) He works a second, part-time job\nat an office supply store to bring in extra cash. (Gx. 2) His current finances, as\nsummarized in Ax. BB, show a $100 increase in his net monthly cash flow against no\nnew debts as Applicant continues to live within his means. (Tr. 51 - 52, 153 - 156)\nApplicant\u2019s performance in the military was exemplary. (Ax. Q) Likewise, his work\nin the civilian sector has drawn similar praise from every company he has worked for.\n(Ax. R; Ax. S) He is also active in his community through his work as an amateur radio\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n5\noperator. He and his colleagues were instrumental in emergency responses when his\ncommunity was devastated by tornadoes and other disasters in the past few years. He\nalso volunteers his time and services in support of several community events each year.\nAs an officer in the amateur radio clubs to which he belongs, Applicant established a\nrecord of reliability and trustworthiness through his work as treasurer. (Ax. U; Ax. V;\nTr.138 - 144; 185 - 186) His reputation for honesty, reliability, and trustworthiness at\nwork, in his church, and in the community is uniformly endorsed as beyond question.\n(Tr. 121 - 123; Ax. W - AA)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n4\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, these factor are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nGuideline F (financial considerations), at AG \u00b6 18, and Guideline E (personal conduct)\nat AG \u00b6 15.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n See, AG \u00b616(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\n8\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance  eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities).\n6\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n6\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The\ngovernment, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses\nthe requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the\nnational interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for\naccess in favor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nPersonal Conduct.\nApplicant\u2019s personal conduct may be a security concern because, as stated in\nAG \u00b6 15,\n[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nThe government\u2019s information shows he answered \u201cno\u201d to questions 38 and 39 in\nthe SF 86 he submitted in June 2005. However, to be disqualifying, it must be shown\nApplicant knowingly intended it as a false answer so as to mislead the government by\nconcealing his financial problems.  Because Applicant denied the gravamen of the\n8\nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b, the government bore the burden of \u201cpresenting\nwitnesses and other evidence to establish facts that have been controverted.\u201d\n(Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.14) The record contains no statement by Applicant\nthat would tend to show he deliberately falsified his answers. The record contains no\nsworn statement of subject or summary of a subject interview from his background\ninvestigation, and the government\u2019s cross-examination of Applicant failed to produce\nany information to show he deliberately omitted relevant information from his SF 86.\nFurther, DOHA adjudicators did not inquire about his SF 86 answers when they\ntendered the interrogatories about his finances in April 2007. \nApplicant\u2019s explanation about his lack of knowledge of the debts as of June 2005\nwas plausible. It was corroborated by his testimony from his ex-wife and two witnesses,\nas well as by documents showing the proceeds from the sale were, indeed, transferred\nto his ex-wife\u2019s account. The totality of the information probative of Applicant\u2019s intent at\n\n7\nthe time he completed the SF 86 in question shows he lacked the requisite disqualifying\nintent. Accordingly, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b are resolved for the Applicant. \nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.g that Applicant was responsible for seven delinquent debts totaling\n$11,266. Even though the credit reports in Gx. 4, 5 and 6 show collection referrals and\ncharge offs after Applicant and his wife divorced, the debts were originally incurred\nwhile they were married. Despite the arrangement Applicant and his ex-wife had\nregarding the use of the proceeds from the sale of their house to pay their debts, the\naccounts were not paid or otherwise resolved until 2007. Accordingly, available\ninformation about Applicant\u2019s finances supports application of the disqualifying condition\nlisted in AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).\nIn response to the government\u2019s information, Applicant established that his past\nfinancial problems do not reflect adversely on his judgment or reliability; that although\nthe debts were only recently paid off or resolved, they were incurred at least three years\nago under circumstances (reduced income because of illness and unemployment) that\nno longer exist. Further, as to the SOR \u00b6 1.h allegation that he did not act to resolve his\ndebts despite a significant positive monthly cash flow, he and his wife were aware of\ntheir debts when they separated in 2004. He took action then by essentially forfeiting his\nshare of their home sale proceeds so she could pay those debts. Her apparent failure to\nrepay their marital debts as agreed does not diminish the action he thought he was\ntaking. These facts also show his non-payment of debts was due to circumstances\nbeyond his control.\nAll of the foregoing supports application of the mitigating conditions listed at AG \u00b6\n20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) (emphasis added), AG \u00b6 20(b) (the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's\ncontrol (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances) (emphasis added), AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control) (emphasis added), and AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). More\nspecifically, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies on the strength of the efforts Applicant made to resolve\n\n See footnote 4, supra. \n9\n8\nhis debts when he and his wife separated in 2004. That the arrangement did not work\nthrough no fault of his own does not lessen the mitigation available here. The\nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.h are resolved for the Applicant. On balance, and in\nconsideration of the positive evidence about Applicant\u2019s current finances and instances\nof fiduciary responsibility, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns about his\nfinances. \nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines E and F. I have also reviewed the record before\nme in the context of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 42 years\nold and has spent most of his adult life in either military service or in support of the\ndefense industry. He has held a security clearance without incident since 1988 and his\nrecord of performance in the military and in his civilian has been outstanding. The\ncircumstances that led to his indebtedness are not likely to recur, his current finances\nare sound, and he has established a record of reliability as a fiduciary and through his\nlong-term access to classified information. A fair and commonsense assessment  of all\n9\navailable information shows that the Applicant\u2019s finances do not present an\nunacceptable risk should he be granted access to classified information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.h:\nFor  Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.b\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines B (Foreign \nInfluence) and C (Foreign Preference), arising from Applicant\u2019s connections with Iran. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on February 1, 2006. On \nAugust 20, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines B and C. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJuly 28, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 25, 2007; answered it \non November 8, 2007; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA \nreceived the request on November 13, 2007. Department Counsel was ready to \nproceed on January 30, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on February 4, 2008. \nScheduling the hearing was delayed by the fact that Applicant lives and works outside \nthe U.S. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 17, 2008, scheduling the hearing for \nMay 20, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. At the hearing, Applicant \nrequested additional time to consult with his supervisor and decide whether to retain a \nlawyer or personal representative. I granted his request. DOHA received the transcript \nof this proceeding (Tr1) on June 2, 2008. \n \nOn May 29, 2008, DOHA issued a second notice of hearing, scheduling the \nhearing to reconvene on June 26, 2008. I reconvened the hearing as scheduled. \nApplicant advised me he had consulted with his manager and other company officials \nand decided to represent himself. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted \nin evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through N, which were admitted without objection. I granted \nApplicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until July 14, 2008, to enable him to submit \nadditional documentary evidence and a written closing statement. Applicant timely \nsubmitted AX O, P, Q, and R; and they were admitted without objection. AX P is \nApplicant\u2019s written closing statement. Department Counsel\u2019s responses to AX O, P, Q, \nand R are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibits (HX) II and III. (HX I is discussed \nbelow.) I annotated HX II and III to show which documents were included in each of \nApplicant\u2019s submissions. DOHA received the transcript of these proceedings (Tr2) on \nJuly 9, 2008. The record closed on July 15, 2008. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout Iran. The request and its enclosures were not admitted in evidence but are \nattached to the record as HX I. The facts administratively noticed are set out below in \nmy findings of fact. I declined to take administrative notice based on two reports \nprepared by members of the Congressional Research Service, because the reports do \nnot reflect that the views expressed in the reports were accepted by an agency of the \nU.S. government as not subject to reasonable dispute. The two reports were admitted, \nhowever, as GX 3 and 4 without objection (Tr2 30, 45). \n \nAuthentication of Report of Investigation \n \n \nDepartment Counsel offered GX 2, DOHA interrogatories that included a \npersonal subject interview extracted from a report of investigation, without calling an \nauthenticating witness as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. I explained the authentication \nrequirement to Applicant, and he affirmatively waived it (Tr2 44). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations under Guideline \nB and two allegations under Guideline C. His admissions in his answer to the SOR and \nat the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old senior systems engineer working as an expatriate \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since August \n2000, has been assigned overseas since August 2005, and will return to the U.S. at the \nend of 2008 (Tr2 130). He has held a clearance since August 2000.  \n \n \nApplicant was born in Iran of Iranian parents. He was 18 years old when he came \nto the U.S. in 1978 to complete his education. He left Iran before the revolution, and he \nremembers his parents telling him about the evil forces that were lurking in the country \n(Tr2 68, 124-25). He graduated from college in May 1983 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nelectrical engineering. He received his master\u2019s degree in May 1987 and his doctorate \nin electrical engineering in August 1994. He testified his graduate work was funded by \nthe Office of Naval Research (Tr2 68). While completing his graduate work, he co-\nauthored several scholarly articles on imaging of ocean waves and measuring radar \nbackscatter from the sea (AX E, I and J). He became a U.S. citizen in April 1996. \n \n \nApplicant worked on U.S. Navy projects in the applied physics laboratory of a \nU.S. university from September 1994 to February 1998. His supervisor described him \nas technically competent, completely reliable, pleasant, and cooperative (AX A). While \nat the applied physics laboratory, he co-authored three scholarly articles concerning \nmeasurement of radar backscatter from the sea (AX F, G, and H).  \n \n \nApplicant left the applied physics laboratory in February 1998 to work for a \ndefense contractor. In August 2000, he left this position, where he was highly regarded \n(AX L), to work for his current employer. He is well compensated (AX K), has received \nsolid performance appraisals (AX Q at 2-9), and is respected as an innovator and \ninventor (AX Q at 10). His supervisor for the past three and a half years described him \nas a dedicated, trustworthy, and extensively knowledgeable employee, whose ability to \nwork with foreign partners has been exemplary. His supervisor commented on his \noutstanding ability to guide project teams efficiently and effectively, and specifically \nnoted his willingness to give his time to team members who requested his assistance or \ndirection. His supervisor unequivocally recommended continuation of Applicant\u2019s \nclearance (AX R at 2). \n \n \nApplicant married a U.S. citizen, the daughter of a U.S. service member, in \nFebruary 1985. They were separated in June 2005, but they continue to have contact \nabout once a month (Tr2 81). Applicant made the initial down payment on a home for \nhis wife. (Tr2 84-85). \n \n \nApplicant did not visit his family in Iran from 1978 until 2000, because they were \nhealthy enough to travel to the U.S. (Tr2 65, 83). He visited his parents in Iran in July \n\n \n4 \n \n \n2000, December 2002 to January 2003, and October 2003 to January 2004, because \ntheir health was failing. His mother died on March 2002, and his father died in March \n2004. He traveled to Iran in July 2004, August 2005 to September 2005, and December \n2005 to January 2006, to settle the personal affairs of his parents (Tr2 67). He used his \nIranian passport to enter and exit Iran, but not for any other purpose. He used his birth \ncertificate rather than his Iranian passport to establish his identity when handling his \nparents\u2019 affairs (Tr2 100). \n \n \nAfter his parents died, Applicant\u2019s only family members in Iran were his older \nbrother and an aunt. Applicant\u2019s brother emigrated from Iran to the U.S. to attend \nschool; but he was deported for criminal conduct, now resides in Iran, and sells \ncomputer software (Tr2 62-63, 91). His brother\u2019s wife is from a wealthy family in Iran (Tr. \n92). Until Applicant visited his ailing parents in 2000, he and his brother had not seen \neach other for 15 years. They have only sporadic e-mail and telephonic contact. They \ndid not attend each other\u2019s weddings and have not visited each other while Applicant \nhas been assigned overseas. Applicant believes his brother wants to leave Iran and go \nto Canada (Tr. 92). \n \nEven though Applicant\u2019s brother resides in Iran, Applicant felt responsible for \ntaking care of his parents and settling their affairs because he does not consider his \nbrother a responsible person (Tr2 98). He properly notified his security manager of his \nintended travel to Iran (Tr2 53; AX C). \n \nApplicant\u2019s aunt is about 70 years old and has never worked outside the home. \nApplicant has virtually no contact with her. They last saw each other at Applicant\u2019s \nfather\u2019s funeral (Tr2 93). Based on information from his sister, Applicant believes his \naunt currently resides in the U.S. and may be a U.S. citizen (AX P at 2). His aunt has \nthree children who are U.S. citizens living in the U.S. (Tr2 93). \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister lives in the U.S. (Tr2 97). He testified he is close to her and her \nthree children, and he helped her purchase her home (Tr2 124). Their contact has been \nlimited during his overseas assignment. He also has three cousins living in the U.S., \nwho were born in Iran and became naturalized U.S. citizens (Tr2 62; GX 2). \n \n \nApplicant retained his Iranian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen, and he \nused it to visit his parents in Iran. The passport expired in June 2005, and Applicant had \nit extended in order to settle his parents\u2019 affairs. After learning that the Iranian passport \nraised security concerns, he destroyed it in the presence of his facility security officer \n(AX O). He testified he has no reason to visit Iran now that his parents are deceased \n(Tr2 104). \n \n \nApplicant has no property or financial interests in Iran. He has retirement funds in \nthe U.S. worth about $300,000 (Tr2 85). After his parents died, Applicant inherited some \nproperty, but he transferred his interest in the property to his brother so that his brother \ncould pay his parents\u2019 debts (Tr2 86).  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nNone of Applicant\u2019s family members know he works as a contractor for the U.S. \ngovernment. He tells them he is an engineer and he works on electronic systems (Tr2 \n97).  \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a security investigator in November 2006 about his \nforeign family connections and foreign travel. The investigator concluded his summary \nof the interview with the statement, \u201cSubject cannot be pressured, blackmailed or \ncoerced concerning the above listed information.\u201d (GX 2 at 4.) Applicant commented on \nthis statement in his written closing statement (AX P). Its significance is discussed \nbelow in the analysis of Guideline B. \n \n \nApplicant testified about his gratitude to his parents for selling their property and \nmaking financial sacrifices to send him to the U.S., his gratitude to the U.S. Navy for \nhelping finance his education, and his admiration for the U.S. culture and political \nprinciples, and his strong desire to continue helping to protect the U.S. He testified he \nhas become totally immersed in U.S. culture and political principles, and that his value \nsystem is essentially American (Tr2 73). He votes in state and national elections (Tr2 \n83-84). He compared his experience in the U.S. to experiencing fine wines: \u201c[O]nce you \ntaste them and you acquire that taste, you can never go back to anything else\u201d (Tr2 71). \n \nI took administrative notice of the following facts regarding Iran. Iran is a \ntheocratic Islamic republic dominated by Shia Muslim clergy, with ultimate political \nauthority vested in a learned religious scholar. Iran\u2019s government is hostile to the U.S. \nCurrent U.S. concerns about Iran are based on its efforts to acquire nuclear weapons \nand weapons of mass destruction; support for and involvement in international \nterrorism; support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; and Iran\u2019s \nhuman rights abuses, including summary executions, torture, arbitrary arrest and \ndetention, and restrictions on civil liberties. Iran has provided guidance, training, and \nweapons to Shia political and militant groups in Iraq. It also provides encouragement, \ntraining, funding, and weapons to anti-Israeli terrorist groups in its efforts to undermine \nthe Arab-Israeli peace process, and it advocates the destruction of Israel. The U.S. has \ndesignated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism. The U.S. broke diplomatic relations with \nIran in April 1980, prohibits most trade with Iran, and uses multilateral sanctions and \ndiplomatic pressure to contain the threats posed by Iran. Because Iran does not \nrecognize dual citizenship, Iranian-born, naturalized U.S. citizens are considered solely \nIranian citizens by the Iranian authorities, and they are required to enter and exit Iran on \nan Iranian passport. While traveling or residing in Iran, they are subject to surveillance, \nsearch, harassment, arrest, and imprisonment. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \n\n \n6 \n \n \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s brother and aunt are citizens and residents of Iran \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b), and that he traveled to Iran six times between July 2000 and \nJanuary 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s travel to Iran was solely to care for his ailing parents and to settle \ntheir affairs after they died. Except for the fact that he used an Iranian passport to enter \nand exit Iran, his foreign travel has no independent security significance. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-26978 (App. Bd. Sep 21, 2005). \n \n \nA disqualifying condition under this guideline may be raised by \u201ccontact with a \nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who \nis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a). Under \nthe old guidelines, any risk of foreign influence was sufficient to raise a potentially \ndisqualifying condition. The new guidelines require a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d \u201cHeightened \nrisk\u201d is a relative term denoting a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a \nfamily member living under a foreign government. The requirement for a \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d in Applicant\u2019s case is satisfied by the nature of the Iranian government and its \nhostility towards the U.S.  \n \nThe totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each \nindividual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. \n22, 2003). Although the SOR alleges Applicant has two family members who are \ncitizens and residents of Iran, the evidence reflects that his aunt now resides in the \nU.S., and Applicant\u2019s brother is the only family member remaining in Iran. However, the \npresence of Applicant\u2019s brother in Iran is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 7(a). \n \nA disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \n\n \n8 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n7(b). The presence of Applicant\u2019s brother in Iran is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 7(b). \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, \n2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the U.S. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). In light of \nthe nature of Iran\u2019s government, its disregard for human rights, its hostility to the U.S. \nand its efforts to acquire the technology for nuclear weapons and weapons of mass \ndestruction, Applicant has a heavy burden of mitigating the security concerns raised by \nhis connections to Iran. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(a). Although Applicant considers his brother something of a black \nsheep in the family and they have little contact, the familial sense of obligation remains. \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that contacts with an immediate family member are \nnot casual, and Applicant has not rebutted that presumption. See ISCR Case No. 00-\n0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002). His brother apparently is not connected to the \ngovernment or engaged in a high-technology enterprise likely to engage in industrial \nespionage, but his connection to a wealthy family increases his profile in Iran. Applicant \nhas been careful not to disclose his connections to the U.S. government, but he is the \nwell respected author of numerous scholarly works published in professional journals on \n\n \n9 \n \n \ntopics of interest to any country with a Navy, making him a potential target of espionage \nor attempts at foreign influence, independent of his governmental connection. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b). This \nmitigating condition has no counterpart in the old guidelines. Under the old adjudicative \nguidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign family members could not be \nmitigated unless an applicant could establish that the family members were not \u201cin a \nposition to be exploited.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.1. The Appeal Board consistently applied \nthis mitigating condition narrowly, holding that an applicant should not be placed in a \nposition where he or she is forced to make a choice between the interests of the family \nmember and the interests of the U.S. See ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. \n17, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-24933 at 6 (App. Bd. Jul. 28, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, \n2005). Thus, an administrative judge was not permitted to apply a balancing test to \nassess the extent of the security risk. Under the old guidelines, the heavy burden of \nmitigating security concerns amounted to an impossible burden when Iran was involved. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-12471 (A.J. May 30, 2008) at 9 n. 1-2 (summarizing Appeal \nBoard decisions involving Iran under old guidelines). Under the new guidelines, \nhowever, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to determine if an applicant \n\u201ccan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d   \n \n \nApplicant left Iran before the revolution and has no sense of loyalty or obligation \nto the current Iranian government. He regards the current Iranian government as evil \nand brutal. He has not established that his sense of loyalty or obligation to his brother is \n\u201cminimal,\u201d but he has demonstrated that he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor \nof the U.S., because he willingly destroyed his Iranian passport, making it virtually \nimpossible for him to visit his brother. \n \n \nApplicant has established \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships in the U.S.\u201d He \nmarried a U.S. citizen and daughter of a U.S. service member in 1985. They were \ntogether for more than 20 years, and they remain in contact even though they are \nseparated. Applicant is close to his sister and three nieces, who live in the U.S. He lived \nin the U.S. for 27 years until his foreign assignment in August 2005. He will return to the \nU.S. upon completion of his foreign assignment. He has devoted himself to defense-\nrelated research for his entire career. He has been a U.S. citizen for more than 12 years \nand held a clearance for almost 8 years. He is deeply grateful for the educational \nassistance he received from the Navy and the opportunities he has enjoyed in the U.S. \nAll his financial assets are in the U.S. He admires and respects the U.S. and has \nembraced its values, because of the freedom and opportunities he has experienced. I \nconclude Applicant would resolve any potential conflict in favor of the interests of the \nU.S. Thus, I conclude AG \u00b6 8(b) is established. \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \n \nIn his written closing statement (AX P), Applicant called attention to the security \ninvestigator\u2019s concluding comment that Applicant \u201ccannot be pressured, blackmailed or \ncoerced\u201d because of his foreign family connections. Applicant argues that the \ninvestigator\u2019s comment mitigates the security concerns based on foreign family \nmembers. I do not agree with Applicant\u2019s interpretation of the investigator\u2019s comment. \nThe investigator\u2019s comment is a record of what the investigator believed Applicant said \nduring the interview. It is not the investigator\u2019s evaluation of Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to \nforeign influence. \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant exercises dual citizenship (SOR \u00b6 2.a), he \npossessed, used, and extended an Iranian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen (SOR \n\u00b6 2.b and 2.c), and that he used his Iranian passport to enter and exit Iran (SOR \u00b6 2.c). \nThe concern under this guideline as follows: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as \nto indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may \nbe prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States.\u201d AG \u00b6 9.  \n \n \nDual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient to warrant an adverse security \nclearance decision.  ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5, 2000 WL 1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, \n2000). Under Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an applicant is a dual national, but \nrather whether an applicant shows a preference for a foreign country through actions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 15, 1999). \n \n \nA disqualifying condition may arise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or \nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited \nto \u201cpossession of a current foreign passport.\u201d AG \u00b6 10(a)(1). Applicant\u2019s possession, \nextension, and multiple uses of his Iranian passport raise this disqualifying condition, \nshifting the burden to him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on possession or use of a foreign passport may be \nmitigated if \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(e). This mitigating condition is established \nby Applicant\u2019s destruction of his Iranian passport. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n11 \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above in my discussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (b) , but some \nwarrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant was sincere, candid, and credible at the hearing. His admiration for and \nunderstanding of U.S. values, his embrace of those values, and his expressions of \ndedication to the U.S. national defense at the hearing were impressive. He is not only a \nbrilliant scientist; he also is attuned to the international climate in which he works. He \ncame to the U.S. before the Iranian revolution. He recognizes that Iran\u2019s government is \nhostile to the U.S., supports terrorism, seeks the technology to build weapons of mass \ndestruction, and brutalizes its citizens. He has spent his entire adult life conducting \ndefense-related research for the U.S. He is deeply grateful to the U.S. for the \nopportunities it has given him, and he is deeply committed to U.S. values and \ndemocratic principles. He is devoted to his sister and his nieces in the U.S. His only \nfamily member in Iran is his brother, and he has virtually cut himself off from his brother \nby destroying his Iranian passport.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines B and \nC, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence and foreign \npreference. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C (Foreign Preference): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

She was born in the United\nKingdom and became a naturalized U. S. citizen in 1997. In 2002, she renewed her United Kingdom\npassport and does not intend to relinquish it or her dual citizenship. She did not mitigate the security\nconcerns raised by foreign preference. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 15, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for National Security\n\n2\nPositions (e-QIP). The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. On August 7, 2007, as required by Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign\nPreference) of the Adjudicative Guidelines issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to\nApplicant when the SOR was issued. \nOn August 13, 2007, Applicant filed a response to the SOR, admitting all of the allegations,\nand elected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On October 11, 2007,\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing six Government\nItems (Items), and mailed Applicant a complete copy on October 11, 2007. Applicant received the\nFORM on October 23, 2007, along with notification that she had an additional 30 days in which to\nsubmit additional information. Applicant chose not to submit additional documentation and on\nDecember 13, 2007, DOHA assigned the case to me.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in her response to the SOR, I\nmake the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 32-year-old married woman. She was born in the United Kingdom (England).\nShe became a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 1997. She received a graduate degree from a\nU.S. university in 2003. Since January 2005, she has worked as a business analyst for a federal\ncontractor. Prior to that she worked for other companies. In June 2001, she married her husband, a\nU.S. citizen. (e-QIP).\nIn May 2007, Applicant answered Interrogatories requested by the Government regarding her\ndual citizenship. (Item 6). In her response, she indicated that she has a United Kingdom passport,\nwhich was issued in January 2002, because she was born in England. It expires in January 2012. (Id.\nat 3). She further stated that \u201cShould I wish to work in England a passport more easily facilitates this\nprocess.\u201d (Id. at 4). She indicated that she wished to retain that passport \u201cso the option to work in\nEngland is more easily accessible.\u201d (Id.). She has not taken any actions to surrender or destroy that\npassport. (Id.).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information, sets forth criteria which must be evaluated when determining security\nclearance eligibility. Within the Revised Guidelines are factors to consider in denying or revoking\nan individual\u2019s request for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions), and factors\nto consider in granting an individual\u2019s request for access to classified information (Mitigating\nConditions). By recognizing that individual circumstances of each case are different, the guidelines\nprovide substantive standards to assist an administrative judge in weighing the evidence in order to\nreach a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\n\n3\nGranting an applicant\u2019s clearance for access to classified information is based on a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in the individual. Accordingly, decisions under the Directive must\ninclude consideration of not only the actual risk of disclosure of classified information, but also\nconsideration of any possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently compromise\nclassified information. Any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation must be resolved in favor of protecting classified information. Directive, Enclosure 2,\n\u00b6 E2.2.2. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a judgment about\nan applicant\u2019s loyalty. Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. Instead, it is a determination that an applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines established by the Department of Defense for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information. Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531\n(1988). The Directive presumes a rational connection between past proven conduct under any of the\ndisqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case\nNo. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\ncorresponding burden of rebuttal shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation sufficient to overcome the position of the government. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3\n(App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden\nof demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\nclearance.\u201d Id. \nCONCLUSIONS\nAfter considering all facts in evidence and legal standards, including the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, I conclude the following in regard to the allegations contained in the SOR:\nGuideline C: Foreign Preference\nGuideline \u00b6 9 articulates the Government\u2019s concern regarding foreign preference: \u201cWhen an\nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States,\nthen he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the\ninterests of the United States.\u201d\nBased on the evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions, the Government raised a security concern\nunder one Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition: the \u201cexercise of any privilege or obligation\nof foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. Citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember. This includes, but is not limited to: possession of a current foreign passport.\u201d Guideline\n\u00b6 10(a)(1). Since becoming a U.S. citizen in 1997, Applicant obtained a foreign passport in 2002 that\ndoes not expire until 2012. \nAfter the Government raised a disqualification, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut or\nmitigate the allegations. Six Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions are potentially applicable\n\n4\nunder Guidelines \u00b6 11 (a) through (f). They are as follows:\n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign\ncountry;\n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship\noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual\nwas a minor;\n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security authority;\n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security\nauthority, or otherwise invalidated;\n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States\nGovernment.\nBased on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude none of the above\napplies. Although Applicant\u2019s foreign citizenship is based on her birthplace, she continued to\nacknowledge that citizenship in 2002 when she applied for a passport after becoming a U.S. citizen.\nHence, Guidelines \u00b6 11(a) and (c) do not apply. As Applicant clearly stated that she has no intention\nto renounce her dual citizenship or surrender her United Kingdom passport, Guidelines \u00b6 11(b) and\n(e) cannot apply. There is no evidence to indicate that her possession of the foreign passport was\napproved by a federal authority, as required by Guideline \u00b6 11(d). Under the facts in this case,\nGuideline \u00b6 11 (f) is inapplicable.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis\nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the guideline, the\nadjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable information\nabout the applicant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision.\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1 describes the essence of scrutinizing all appropriate variables in a case as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d In evaluating the conduct of an applicant, an administrative judge should\nconsider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of\nparticipation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nIn the present case, there is some information about positive attributes to Applicant\u2019s life as\na U.S. citizen, such as her university studies and husband who is a U.S. citizens. However, those are\ninsufficient to outweigh the fact that Applicant refuses to relinquish dual citizenship or surrender her\nforeign passport, which she intends to maintain for potential employment in the United Kingdom.\nConsequently, Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate those security concerns\nraised under foreign preference. Accordingly, Guideline C is decided against her.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n5\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph 1: Guideline C (Foreign Preference)\nAGAINST Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1c: \nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly not\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied.\nShari Dam\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nR. Wayne Bromwell, Personal Representative\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 25, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On August 11, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings are based on\nsubstantial evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision under Guideline G is\nsustainable.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings: Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a\ndefense contractor.  He graduated from high school in 1989 and attended college for several years.\nApplicant is divorced with two children.  He served in the U.S. Navy from 1993 until 1997, and has\nheld a security clearance from 1997 until the present.\nApplicant started drinking alcohol while in high school, drinking beer on the weekends. He\ncontinued his drinking while in the Navy, on weekends and during shore leave.\n \nIn 1996, Applicant received a Captain\u2019s Mast under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of\nMilitary Justice (UCMJ) for fighting and drunkenness after returning from shore leave.  He received\na restriction for 30 days.  Applicant claimed he did not realize that the 12-ounce can that held his\ndrink was straight vodka.  In 1997, Applicant received a Captain\u2019s Mast for the offense of\ndrunkenness, suspended for six months, and restriction for 30 days.  \nIn 1998, Applicant completed a sworn statement expressing remorse for his drinking and the\ntrouble that it caused him. He stated that he was mature and learned not to abuse alcohol.  However,\nhe continued to consume alcohol.\nIn 1999, Applicant self referred to a 13-week program (outpatient) and attended Alcoholics\nAnonymous (AA) twice a week.  He was drinking three or four mixed drinks each weekend evening.\nIf he was stressed, he drank two drinks on a weekday evening.  His diagnosis by his therapist was\nalcohol abuse.  After completion of the program, Applicant abstained from alcohol for approximately\nnine months. \nIn the early years of his marriage, Applicant drank hard liquor frequently.  He would have\na shot of whiskey.  He became belligerent when he drank according to his own assessment. \nIn 2004, Applicant was arrested for Driving Under the Influence (DUI) and failure to take\na breath test.  He had consumed six to eight beers prior to the incident.  Applicant pled guilty to the\ncharge of DUI and was sentenced to 30 days in jail and a one year restricted driver\u2019s license.  He was\nordered to attend the driver safety program for counseling and to pay court costs and fines of $550.\nApplicant completed the alcohol classes in 2006. \nIn 2005, Applicant\u2019s court ordered therapist recommended continued abstinence and\ninvolvement with AA.  He was diagnosed as alcohol dependent with a good prognosis.  Applicant\nstill consumes alcohol, is confident that he has control over alcohol, and does not consider himself\nto be alcohol dependent.\nApplicant\u2019s manager at work testified to his long time association with Applicant, and to his\ngood character and professionalism at work, and to his generosity and ability to help others.  He\nrecommends Applicant for a security clearance. \n\nApplicant admitted to both of these allegations in his answer to the SOR.\n1\nAs part of his brief, Applicant\u2019s Personal Representative offers new evidence in the form of his personal\n2\nobservations as to Applicant\u2019s character, loyalty, and excellent job performance.  The Board cannot consider this new\nevidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nSOR paragraph 1(f).\n3\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision should be reversed because the\nJudge erred in finding that the incidents leading to Applicant\u2019s Captain\u2019s Masts in 1996 and 1997\nwere alcohol-related.   He also argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is not supported by the\n1\nrecord as a whole.   The Board does not find these arguments persuasive.\n2\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s findings are based on\nsubstantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the record.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the\ncase.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern\nare sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17691 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul.19,\n2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nlength and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  She found in favor of Applicant as to one\nof the SOR factual allegations.   However, she reasonably explained why the evidence which\n3\nApplicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by\nApplicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record,\n\nthe Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory\nexplanation for her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the\nchoice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,\n463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168\n(1962)). \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with\nthe interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\nAccordingly, the Judge\u2019s ultimate adverse decision under Guideline G is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned; Michael Y.

On March 25, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline G for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department \nof Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.   \n  \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the \ncase assignment on June 13, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 24, 2008, \nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 30, 2008. The Government offered \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his \nown behalf and presented the testimony of one witness. DOHA received the transcript of \n \n \n1 \n \n \nAugust 11, 2008\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nthe hearing (Tr.) on July 9, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, \nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is  denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted to the allegations in && 1.a- 1.h in the SOR under Guideline G. \nThe admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete review of the \nevidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make the following additional findings \nof fact: \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from high \nschool in 1989 and attended college for several years. He is divorced with two children. \nApplicant served in the U.S. Navy from 1993 until 1997 (GE 2). Applicant held a security \nclearance from 1997 until the present. He has been with his current employer since 2005. \n \nApplicant started drinking alcohol while in high school. He was 17 years old and \nspent the time with older friends drinking beer on the weekends (Tr. 32). Applicant \ncontinued his drinking in the Navy on weekends. He would drink when he was on shore \nleave when he was deployed overseas. Applicant drank hard liquor when he visited foreign \nports (Tr. 35). He sampled different beer and alcohol in various countries. \n \nIn August 1996, Applicant received a Captain=s Mast under Article 15 of the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice (UCMJ) for fighting and drunkenness after returning from shore \nleave. He received a restriction for 30 days. He claimed he did not realize that the 12 ounce \ncan that held his drink was straight vodka. He admitted he consumed too much (Tr. 24-25)  \n \nIn 1997, Applicant was in another foreign port. He was drinking and fought with a \nfriend of his in the Navy (GE 3). He received a Captain=s Mast for the offense of \ndrunkenness, suspended for six months and restriction for 30 days. In 1998, Applicant \ncompleted a sworn statement expressing remorse for his drinking and the trouble that it \ncaused him. He stated that he was mature and learned not to abuse alcohol (Id). However, \nhe continued to consume alcohol. \n \nIn 1999, Applicant self referred to a 13-week program (outpatient) and attended \nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) twice a week. He was drinking three or four mixed drinks each \nweekend evening. If he was stressed, he drank two drinks on a weekday evening (Tr. 41). \nHis diagnosis by his therapist was alcohol abuse. After completion of the program, \nApplicant abstained from alcohol for approximately nine months (Tr. 43). \n \nIn the early years of his marriage, Applicant drank hard liquor frequently. He would \nhave a shot of whiskey. He became belligerent when he drank according to his own \nassessment. \n \nOn December 7, 2004, Applicant was returning from a fishing trip. He had consumed \nsix to eight beers (Tr. 28). He was arrested for Driving under the Influence (DUI) and failure \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nto take a breath test (GE 6). Applicant pled guilty to the charge of DUI at court on March 15, \n2005. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail and a one year restricted driver license. He was \nordered to attend the driver safety program for counseling. He had court costs and fines of \n$550. He completed the alcohol classes in February 2006 (GE 4 and 5).  \n \nIn 2005, his court ordered therapist recommended continued abstinence and \ninvolvement with AA (GE 7). He was diagnosed as alcohol dependent with a good \nprognosis. Applicant still consumes alcohol. He does not usually drink hard liquor. He has \nbeer or a glass of wine (Tr. 27). He is confident that he has control over alcohol. He does \nnot consider himself to be alcohol dependent. \n \nApplicant=s manager at work testified to his long time association with Applicant. He \nhired him in 1999. He attests to Applicant=s good character and professionalism at work. He \nknew Applicant when he was going through a difficult time in his marriage and knows about \nhis drinking (Tr. 63) He sees Applicant every day at work. He praises Applicant=s generosity \nand ability to help others. He recommends him for a security clearance (Tr. 68). \n \nApplicant testified at the hearing that his current drinking depends on his activity. On \nweekends, he drinks two, three or four drinks each weekend evening. If there is a social \ngathering, it would be different. On New Year=s eve, he had a shot of hard liquor. He is \nconfident that the 2004 DUI was his wake up call and drinking is not an issue in his life. He \ndoes not drink and drive (Tr. 48).  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative \nJudge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \nApplicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities \nof human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge=s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG & 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the Awhole person concept.@ The \nAdministrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that A[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n \nUnder Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting Awitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .@ The Applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \nApplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be Ain terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.@ See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to \nclassified or sensitive information).  \n  \n \nAnalysis \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set \nforth in the SOR: \n  \nGuideline G(Alcohol Consumption) The Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often \nleads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can \nraise questions about an individual=s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant was \narrested in 2004 for an alcohol related driving incident. He received two Captain=s Masts \nwhile in the Navy in 1996 and 1997 for drinking. He was diagnosed as alcohol dependent \nby a therapist. Consequently, Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (AC DC) AG \n&22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence, \nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, \nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent) applies. Applicant admitted that he consumed alcohol, at times to excess and \nto the point of intoxication from 1988 until the present. Thus, AC DC AG &22(c) (habitual or \nbinge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment regardless of whether the \nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) applies. \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant received treatment for alcohol problems in 1999. He was diagnosed as an \nalcohol abuser. Therefore, AC DC AG &22(d) (diagnosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or \nalcohol dependence) applies in this case. In 2005, Applicant received a diagnosis of alcohol \ndependence after his 2004 DUI. He was diagnosed by a licensed clinical counselor \naffiliated with a treatment program. Thus, AC DC AG &22(e) (evaluation of alcohol abuse or \nalcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a \nrecognized alcohol treatment program) applies.  \n \nApplicant still consumes alcohol, albeit in a more controlled setting. His treatment \nplan in 2005 recommended that he continue with AA and abstinence. However, he \ncompleted the program. AC DC AG &22(g) (failure to follow any court order regarding \nalcohol education, evaluation, treatment, or abstinence) does not apply.  \n \nWith the government=s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present \nevidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. I \nconsidered the Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) AG &23(a) (so much \ntime has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual=s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). There are no Abright line@ rules for \ndetermining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination must be based on Aa careful \nevaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.@ If the \nevidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct,@, then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform \nor rehabilitation.@ AC MC &23(a) has some applicability in this case. Applicant was found \nguilty of DUI in 2004. He has not had another alcohol-related driving incident. However, he \ncontinues to drink beer and on New Year=s eve had a shot of liquor. He does not receive \nfull credit under this mitigating condition. \n \nApplicant does not believe he has a problem with alcohol. He does not believe he is \nalcohol dependent. He has modified his drinking but did not follow a recommendation for \nabstinence. Thus, AC MC &23(b) (the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or \nissues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an \nalcohol abuser)) does not apply in this case.  \n \nApplicant voluntarily completed an alcohol treatment program in 1999 and a court \nordered one in 2005. He completed both programs. He attended AA for a period of time \nand he remained abstinent for a period of time. He now believes his drinking is under \ncontrol and he has no need for treatment or abstinence. He does not drink and drive. AC \nMC & 23(d) (the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or \nrehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, such as participating in Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nand has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment \nprogram) does not fully apply.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant=s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual=s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potential disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems first began, Applicant \nwas a young man, still in high school.  Since that time, Applicant continued his drinking \nwhich led to some problems while he was in the Navy. He received treatment in 1999. After \na period of abstinence and going to AA, he decided that he could drink again. \n \nIn 2004, Applicant was arrested and then convicted for a DUI. He completed a \ntreatment program. His prognosis is good. However, Applicant did not follow a \nrecommendation to remain abstinent or to attend AA. Granted, he has not had any more  \nalcohol-related driving incidents since 2004. He does not drink and drive. He claims he has \nmodified his consumption of alcohol. \n \nApplicant has a good career record. He has had a security clearance for many years \nwithout incident. He was candid in his testimony at the hearing. However, he had a \ndiagnosis twice for alcohol issues and he does not acknowledge any problems with alcohol. \nI have doubts as to his judgment in this area.

On August 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security clearance concerns under\nfinancial considerations (Guideline F), personal conduct (Guideline E), and criminal\nconduct (Guideline J). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\nmade effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was received by DOHA on October 16, 2007. I\nreceived the case assignment on November 13, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing\non December 3, 2007, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on December 18,\n2007. The government presented Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6. Applicant testified on his\nown behalf. He submitted no exhibits. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing\nJanuary 28, 2008\n\n2\non January 4, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for security clearance access is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted all allegations under paragraph 1 (financial considerations).\nHe admitted the three allegations under paragraph 2 (personal conduct). He also\ndenied the personal conduct allegations constitute criminal conduct as alleged by\nparagraph 3 of the SOR.  Applicant is 40 years old and employed as an aircraft\nmechanic with a defense contractor. He has held that position for the last nine years.\nFrom 1986 until his Honorable Discharge in October 1998, he was employed by the\nmilitary. He is married with five children. He seeks a security clearance.\nAfter serving 12 years in the military, Applicant was 28 years old when he\ndiscovered he had a medical condition that mandated his discharge in October 1998.\nHe received a $400.00-medical-disability that was a critical monetary source for bill\npayment while he searched for a job. In late 1998, he found a job, but had to\nimmediately take medical leave when his condition caused temporary blindness for\napproximately a month. While on medical leave, he fell behind in his mortgage. When\nhe returned from leave, his mortgage was raised from $600.00 to $1,000.00 a month,\nmaking it difficult to pay his other bills. \nIn May 2000, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition (subparagraph 1.a.)\nto save his house. According to GE 6, he purportedly received a Chapter 7 discharge of\nhis debts on October 5, 2000, although the amount of liability discharged is unknown\nbecause there are no records. Significantly, Applicant believes all the bankruptcy\npetitions were dismissed, not discharged. \nIn late 2000, Applicant received foreclosure papers on his house indicating the\ntrustee was not receiving sufficient funds to satisfy the mortgage. He then filed a\nChapter 13 bankruptcy petition (subparagraph 1.b.) on December 13, 2000. The\npetition was dismissed on June 22, 2001 after Applicant\u2019s wife had to be hospitalized,\nand he was required to babysit his children during her hospitalization. Applicant filed a\nsecond Chapter 13 petition (subparagraph 1.c.) on July 10, 2001 that was dismissed\nSeptember 20, 2002 by the judge because of a filing mistake by the staff of Applicant\u2019s\nlawyer. Also, Applicant\u2019s wife had to travel from their home on the eastern side of the\nstate to the local area to care for her mother who was suffering from a terminal illness.\nShe missed a critical court date resulting in dismissal of the second Chapter 13 petition.\nOn August 9, 2002 (subparagraph 1.d.), Applicant filed another Chapter 13\npetition. GE 6 reflects the amount of debt declared in the petition was $149,720.82.\nThis petition was dismissed on October 15, 2003 when Applicant could not make the\nmonthly payments. His wife and children then moved to the family\u2019s current location to\nlive with her parents until she was able to find a house to rent. Meanwhile, Applicant put\ntheir house on the market. After a short period of time, he sold the house and moved to\nthe local area with his wife and family.\n\n Applicant testified the hurricane hit in 2005. I have taken official notice that the hurricane hit the area in the\n1\nsummer of the 2004. \n3\nApplicant found a job just before the hurricane struck the area (circa summer\n2004),  completely wrecking his house and ruining the family\u2019s possessions. Then, he\n1\nwas laid off and had to move into emergency housing (trailer) provided by the federal\ngovernment. Living with his wife and four or five children until October 2006 in a trailer\nwas a real hardship for Applicant and his family. It was not long before his federal\nhousing settlement was overrun by criminal activity and a rodent problem that became\nunbearable. \nIn October 2006, Applicant moved out of the federal trailers with the help of an\naffordable housing organization. After finding a house, he paid $3,000.00 down, and\nbegan paying $1090.00 a month mortgage. Unfortunately, Applicant\u2019s success in\nkeeping his mortgage current since October 2006 has meant that the listed debts have\nnot been paid. \nWhen Applicant was interviewed on December 21, 2005, his income was\n$3,200.00 a month with $2,330.00 a month in expenses. Though his net remainder was\ncalculated to be about $870.00 a month, unanticipated bills frequently arose to deplete\nthe remainder. Recently, he has been removed from the flight line to the aircraft parts\nsection, translating to a reduction in his monthly, net pay to $2,844.00. He has not\nmade any payments on the listed debts. Applicant\u2019s other debts, including his utilities\nand regular expenses are also overdue to some degree. Applicant pays half of his\nregular expenses in one pay period and the other half in the next pay period. The\nmortgage continues to be paid on a regular basis every month. \nApplicant\u2019s wife has not been able to work since approximately October 1998.\nShe suffers from a serious medical condition that prevents her from working. She\napplied for disability insurance, but was rejected. Now that Applicant is earning less\nthan he did in December 2005, he is going to retain someone to help his wife reapply\nfor disability insurance. Because he is currently suffering from a blood circulation\nproblem in his legs, related to his primary medical condition, Applicant is having his\ndisability case reviewed to find out whether he is entitled to additional disability\ninsurance. \nThe 13 past due debts in subparagraphs 1.e. through 1.q. belong to credit card\nissuers, collection agencies, and medical providers. Ten of the creditors are medical\naccounts. The total amount of debt is $14,775.00, with the largest delinquency\n($10,992.00, subparagraph 1.e.) a car loan that was charged off in November 2000.\nThe debts became delinquent between 2000 and 2005. Applicant desires to pay the\ndelinquent debts, but is focusing all efforts on the keeping his house. \nThe personal conduct allegations relate to omitted information that did not\nappear on Applicant\u2019s SCA he submitted to the government on September 20, 2005. In\nresponse to the Section 27a. question requiring information about any bankruptcy\n\n Applicant answered \u201cYES\u201d to the Section 27b. question requiring information about repossessions or\n2\ngarnishments. In the explanation section, Applicant disclosed that the property was worth approximately\n$10,000.00, and had been repossessed in January 2004 by the creditor identified in subparagraph 1.e. of the\nSOR.\n4\npetition that was filed in the last 7 years, Applicant entered a \u201cNO\u201d response.  The\n2\nnegative response was provided even though GE 6 indicates he supposedly received a\nChapter 7 discharge in October 2000, and filed three Chapter 13 petitions. The\nnotification of foreclosure proceedings in late 2000 provided by the trustee raises doubt\nabout whether the first Chapter 7 discharge may have been  converted to a Chapter 13\naction. Applicant denied he falsified his answer to Section 27 because he believed the\nquestion called for completed bankruptcies. I find his explanation credible. \nIn response to the Section 28a. question (any debts over 180 days delinquent in\nthe last 7 years) of the same SCA, Applicant answered \u201cNO.\u201d In response to the section\n28b. question (debts currently over 90 days delinquent), Applicant answered \u201cNO.\u201d In\nhis answer, he mentioned misunderstanding, and being preoccupied with the\nconsequences of the hurricane and squalid life in the federal trailer park as reasons\nwhy he did not answer the SCA questions correctly. At the hearing, he did not know\nwhy he answered \u201cNO\u201d to both questions because he remembered the overdue debts\nwhen he filled out the SCA, but intimated he was more concerned about his family\u2019s\nwretched living conditions. I find he exercised poor judgment by intentionally falsifying\nthe answers to both questions of Section 28.\nPolicies\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in demonstrating that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nFinancial Considerations (FC)\nFailure to live within one\u2019s means raises doubt about a person\u2019s\ntrustworthiness. \n\n5\nPersonal Conduct (PC)\nA lack of candor or poor judgment demonstrated during the security\ninvestigation casts doubt on whether an applicant can dutifully comply with\nsecurity regulations. \nCriminal Conduct (CC)\nViolating the law, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged or prosecuted, raises issues about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability\nand trustworthiness. \nAnalysis\nThe concern of the FC guideline is the following: \u201cFailure or inability to live within\none=s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having\nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nFC disqualifying condition (DC) 19.a. Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is\ndisqualifying. Similarly under FC DC 19.c. , Aa history of not meeting financial\nobligations@ may raise security concerns. Considering the circumstances under which\nApplicant was required to terminate his military service and the short time between his\ndischarge and the filing of his first bankruptcy petition in May 2000, it is fair to conclude\nhe was not prepared to handle the sudden transition to civilian life with a wife and five\nchildren. The record reveals that Applicant pursued four bankruptcy petitions between\nMay 2000 and March 2004. Though GE 6 clearly reflects his first bankruptcy petition\nwas filed under Chapter 7, there is some evidence to conclude the Chapter 7 was\nactually converted to a Chapter 13. The dismissal of at least three Chapter 13 petitions\nwith continuing financial problems justifies application of FC DC 19.a. and 19.c. to these\nfacts. \nThe FC guideline also includes conditions that mitigate security worthiness\nconcerns generated by financial difficulties. Applicant obtains limited mitigation from FC\nmitigating condition (MC) 20.a., Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Though\nthe behavior occurred under bizarre circumstances that are unlikely to recur, there is\nevidence of at least one account becoming delinquent in 2005, less than three years\nago. \nUnder FC MC 20.b. Athe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\n\n6\nacted responsibly under the circumstances@ may apply when unforeseen events occur\nthat are outside a person\u2019s control. Applicant receives substantial mitigation from FC\nMC 20.b. beginning in October 1998, when he discovered his very serious illness that\nnecessitated his  discharge from the service. Fortunately, he was able to rely on his\ndisability insurance to support his wife and five children while he looked for a job in late\n1998. Unfortunately, immediately after he found a job, he suffered  temporary blindness\nfor about a month, a byproduct of his primary illness. \nApplicant\u2019s lack of success with his bankruptcy petitions shows how serious he\nwas about keeping his house, yet trying to pay back something to the delinquent\ncreditors. I conclude that, considering his wife\u2019s medical problems, primarily her medical\ncondition that prevented her from working, and his unsuccessful efforts in seeking\nbankruptcy protection from 2000 to March 2004, he acted  reasonably under the\ncircumstances. \nShortly after selling his original house, Applicant moved to the local area in 2004,\nand found a job. However, the hurricane destroyed his family\u2019s house, requiring them to\nquickly move to a federal trailer park on very short notice. It is fair to conclude he was\nnot prepared for the outrageous living conditions he would have to tolerate until October\n2006.  \nThough there is clearly a lack of evidence under FC MC 20.c. \u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is under control\u201d and FC MC 20.d. \u201cthe individual has initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d I conclude that the\ncumulative impact of the medical conditions of Applicant and his wife, as well as\nmeteorological events well beyond their control, contributed substantially to their\ninability to regain control over their financial responsibilities. The financial guideline is\nresolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nThe personal conduct omissions occurred in September 2005. Applicant\u2019s\nnegative answer to Section 27a. was clearly incorrect given the four bankruptcy\npetitions he filed over a four-year period, with the last petition being dismissed less than\ntwo years before he submitted his SCA. But, the insufficient mortgage payment that\nsurfaced in late 2000 suggests the Chapter 7 discharge may have actually been\nconverted to a Chapter 13. Further, Applicant disclosed his largest debt in his response\nto Section 27b. of his SCA, when he identified the delinquent car loan account in\nsubparagraph 1.e. Considering the evidence as a whole, I conclude he misread the\nSection 27a. question and was not trying to conceal his bankruptcies. Subparagraph\n2.a. is found in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nSubparagraphs 2.b. and 2.c. require application of PC DC 16.a. \u201cdeliberate\nomission or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire to\ndetermine security clearance eligibility.\u201d However, the totality of the record persuades\nme to find for Applicant under PC MC 17.d. \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the\nbehavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken positive steps to\nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\n\n7\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d The remorse\nand contrition Applicant demonstrated at the hearing convince me he fully understands\nthe gravity of his dishonest conduct and will not engage in such disqualifying behavior in\nthe future. \nDeliberate falsifications of material information under the PC guideline may also\nconstitute criminal conduct under the CC guideline. CC DC 31.c. \u201callegation or\nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\nformally prosecuted or convicted\u201d applies based on the allegation that Applicant\u2019s\ndeliberate falsification also constitutes felonious criminal behavior under 18 U.S.C.\n1001, even though Applicant was not formally charged. As with my finding for Applicant\nunder the PC guideline, I also find for Applicant under the CC guideline. Read together,\nCC MC 33.a. \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment\u201d and CC\nMC 32.d. \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement\u201d justify a favorable outcome for Applicant under the CC guideline. A bizarre\nset of confluent weather and living conditions played a small part in Applicant\u2019s\ndishonest conduct in September 2005. He recognizes his poor judgment. Because I\nbelieve he will not engage in this kind of behavior in the future, subparagraph 3 is\nresolved in his favor. \nWhole Person Concept\nIn addition to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have also considered\nthis case under the totality of Applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances, otherwise\nreferred to as the whole person concept. Nine adjudicative process factors make up the\nwhole person concept. Those factors are: \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of\nthe conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d The ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the factors of the\nwhole person concept.   \nI have discussed the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts\nand circumstances surrounding this case. In October 1998, Applicant was 30 years old\nwhen he was involuntarily discharged because of his medical condition. While he may\nhave been nine years beyond the age of adulthood when he departed the military, he\nwas clearly unprepared for transition to civilian life and the responsibilities of raising a\nfamily of six or seven. He accumulated debt due to circumstances largely beyond his\ncontrol. Those circumstances have included continuing medical conditions for\n\n8\nApplicant and his wife, his wife\u2019s inability to work because of her medical condition, and\nthe calamitous weather event leading not only to a total loss of their possessions, but\nalso forcing them into intolerable living conditions in the federal trailer park. Though he\ndeliberately falsified the Section 28 questions about his debts, and waffled somewhat in\nhis written answer to the SOR, Applicant\u2019s admission of responsibility for his isolated\ndishonesty, and intention to repay his past due debt is credible and worthy of belief. For\nall these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns triggered by\nthe FC, PC, and CC guidelines. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings pursuant to section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3 (Criminal Conduct, Guideline J):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Blank, Jr.,  Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nMarch 6, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn July 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 29, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on October 29, 2008.  Applicant did not file a\n1\nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on February 13, 2009. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 53 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant used marijuana \u201conce every couple of months with friends\u201d in 1995\n(Exhibit 6).  He used cocaine once in November 2003. His cocaine use was discovered\nduring a random drug screening at his place of employment on the day following his\ncocaine use.  His use of both drugs occurred while he was holding a security clearance\nand/or a special access clearance. Both clearances were suspended following this\npositive drug test.\nIn a signed, sworn statement he gave to an OPM/DOD investigator in October\n2006 (Exhibit 5), applicant stated the following while discussing his cocaine use: \u201cI had\nnever used any illegal drugs before and decided to try it,\u201d and \u201cI have never used any\nillegal drug before this incident and I have not used any since.\u201d  These statements were\nfalse because, as noted above, he had used marijuana in 1995. In his response to the\nSOR, applicant admitted that he deliberately failed to disclose his marijuana use when\nhe made these false statements.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\n\n3\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set forth in\nParagraph 15 of the AG, and is as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nParagraph16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 16.b., \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading\ninformation concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official,\ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative\u201d may be\ndisqualifying. This disqualifying condition is applicable because applicant deliberately\nprovided false material information to the OPM/DOD investigator.\nParagraph 17 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Under\nParagraph 17.a., it may be mitigating if \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to\ncorrect the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the\nfacts.\u201d The evidence establishes that applicant revealed his marijuana use to an\nOPM/DOD investigator in December 2007, a little over a year after he concealed it from\na different OPM/DOD investigator. Even if it is assumed applicant voluntarily came\nclean before being confronted with the facts, waiting over a year to do so hardly\nconstitutes a \u201cprompt, good-faith effort\u201d to correct the facts. Accordingly, this mitigating\ncondition is not applicable.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\n\n4\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature man with a\nrecent history of deliberately providing false material information to the Government. He\nprovided no evidence from independent sources (e.g., family, friends, coworkers,\nneighbors) that would support a finding that this act of dishonesty was out of character\nfor him, or that he is likely to be truthful with the Government in the future. Without such\nevidence, I have no choice but to conclude he failed to mitigate the security concerns\narising from Guideline E.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Daniel S. Alderman, Esquire\nAugust 25, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn December 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline\nE for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on February 18, 2009, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on April 9, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 21,\n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 26, 2009. The Government\noffered Government Exhibits 1 through 9, which were received and admitted. Applicant\ntestified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits A through E, which were\nalso received and admitted. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on June 4,\n\n2\n2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 61 years old. He is married, and he has no children. He received a\nPh.D. in Mechanical Engineering and Material Science.\nApplicant was employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with future employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he engaged in conduct that exhibited questionable judgement, lack\nof candor, dishonesty or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.   \n         1.a. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant was terminated by his employer\n(Company A), for which he had worked from 1997 to 2001, in September 2001, for\nmisconduct.\nIn his RSOR, Applicant denied this allegation. At the hearing, Applicant testified\nthat his termination was not because of misconduct. His testimony was that Company A\nwanted him to patent technology that he had created for them, but he insisted that he\ncould not have it patented, since it was based on another concept, which was already\npatented (Tr at 44-45). He averred that he was not actually terminated, but the company\ngave him the option of patenting this technology or leaving the company, and since he\nfelt it would not be proper to have the technology patented, he chose to leave the\ncompany.\nAt a later date, Applicant attempted to collect unemployment compensation, as a\nresult of his employment at Company A. The company disputed his claim, arguing that\nhe had been terminated for misconduct. Applicant appealed Company A\u2019s decision, and\nthe Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board ruled that Applicant was not terminated for\nmisconduct, and he could receive unemployment compensation (Exhibit 3).  Ultimately,\nhe was rehired by Company A in 2004. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s explanation of the situation, the fact that it was determined\nby the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board that he could collect unemployment\ncompensation because he was not terminated for misconduct, and that he was rehired\nby Company A, the facts indicate that Applicant was not terminated for misconduct from\nCompany A. \n\n3\n1.b. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant was terminated from a second\nemployer (Company B), for which he had worked from September 2003 to January\n2004, for unsatisfactory behavior and performance, and that he is not eligible for rehire. \nIn his RSOR, Applicant denied this allegation. At the hearing, Applicant testified\nthat when he was hired by Company B it was an upper level position that would utilize\nhis knowledge and experience. However, the position was not available by the time he\nbecame employed, and thus he was offered a far less demanding and prestigious\nposition that did not fully utilize his skills, and in fact it was not a position for which he\nwas trained (Tr at 52-54). He accepted this position, but he was informed that\nsomething more appropriate would become available. \nI find that Applicant was terminated from this position. Exhibit 2 includes the\nTermination of Employment letter, dated January 30, 2004, from Company B to\nApplicant. It stated that Applicant failed to complete three tasks that had been assigned\nto him, and they were unable to find another assignment for him. This letter does not\naddress whether Applicant would be available for rehire. However, a follow up letter\nfrom the human resources manager, dated March 5, 2004, makes it clear that Applicant\nis not eligible for rehire (Exhibit 2).\n1.c. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant contacted several managers from\nCompany B in February 2004 in an effort to resume his employment with Company B,\nwhich was contrary to his ineligibility status. \nApplicant testified that he was never informed that he was not to contact\nindividuals at Company B regarding re-employment or that he was not eligible for rehire\n(Tr at 61-62). Additionally, while he was working in his previous position, he met the vice\npresident of Engineering, and he forwarded to him his then current resume, asking if\nthere was a position in the company more suited to his experience. Exhibit 3, page 24,\nhas the email from the vice president in which he stated, \u201cthere should be a large\nnumber of opportunities here for someone like yourself.\u201d Applicant believed that, based\non that email, there would be other positions more appropriate to his skill level, and he\nbelieved it was not inappropriate to attempt to obtain another position within the\ncompany. Applicant stated that the individuals, whom he contacted, indicated to him\nthat they would be interested in discussing with him potential positions with the\ncompany.  \n1.d. Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SCA) which he\ncaused to be electronically submitted on or about July 2, 2004 (Exhibit 1). Question #20\nof the SCA asked whether during the last seven years, Applicant had ever been\nterminated from a job, or lost his job under other than favorable circumstances.\nApplicant replied \u201cYes\u201d to that question and furnished the Government with information\nabout his separation from Company A, as discussed in subparagraph 1.a., above.\nHowever, Applicant failed to supply the information about his employment separation\nfrom Company B, as discussed in subparagraph 1.b., above, alleged. The SOR alleges\nthat Applicant was not truthful because he failed to include his termination from\nCompany B, as discussed in 1. b., above. \n\n4\nAt the hearing, Applicant conceded that he should have included the termination\nfrom Company B (Tr at 51-52). He testified that Exhibit 1 was the first SCA that he had\never completed. He stated that he was told the sooner he completed the application, the\nsooner he could begin working for the company, and therefore he rushed to complete it\non a computer, completing it all in one night, and he was not as careful as he should\nhave been (Tr at 39-42, 111). He received an interim clearance in 10 days. In 2007 he\nsent another copy of the same SCA, after being informed that the DoD did not have a\ncopy of it. He was not made aware of the problems with his responses to the 2004 SCA\nuntil 2008. \nWhile it is clear that Applicant should have reported his employment situation\nwith Company B on the SCA, I find his explanation credible that his failure to include his\nCompany B termination was due to inadvertence and not an attempt to mislead the\nGovernment. \n1.e. On the July 2004 SCA, Question #6 requested that all employment activities,\nwithout breaks, be listed from the last 7 years before the SCA was completed. The\nexception was that all Federal civilian employment was to be listed whether or not it\noccurred within the last 7 years. Applicant listed that he has been employed as a\nconsultant for Company C from 1994 to 1997. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant\ndeliberately failed to list that he was also a consultant for Company C from about\nJanuary 2004 to June 2004.\nApplicant testified that during the period from January 2004 to June 2004 that he\nconsulted for Company C, which was his own company, he did not earn any income, so\nhe believed that it was not correct to include this period for Question #6 (Tr at 63-64).\nIt does appears that Applicant had a reasonable, if not correct, assumption that\nhe was only to list periods of employment when he earned an income. Applicant did list\nnine different employment positions on his SCA. I do not find that he was attempting to\nmislead the Government with this omission.\n1.f. On the July 2004 SCA, in response to Question #6, Applicant listed that he\nhad been employed as a consultant for Company D from 2001 to June 2004. It is\nalleged in the SOR that Applicant deliberately failed to list that he was unemployed for\nabout four months in 2002 and 2003, during which time he received unemployment\nbenefits (Tr at 65-67). \nApplicant testified that the unemployment compensation that he earned for the\nperiod in 2002 and 2003 resulted from when he had been employed by Company A, as\nreviewed in 1.a., above. He stated that he continued to consult for Company D, but for a\nperiod of time he was not receiving any income, and thus he applied for unemployment\ncompensation, which he ultimately received after the challenge before the\nUnemployment Insurance Appeal Board. \nIn reviewing Applicant\u2019s affidavit, signed by him on January 11, 2008, (Exhibit 4),\nApplicant explained what he again reiterated at the hearing, specifically that he did not\n\n5\nunderstand that periods of time when he collected unemployment should be listed under\nthe request for employment activities. He stated that he was not attempting to mislead\nthe Government, and in fact when he was interviewed by a Government investigator, he\nvolunteered that he had received unemployment compensation, as the investigator was\nnot aware of it. \nI find that Applicant again had a reasonable, if not correct, assumption that he\nwas only to list periods of employment, not periods when he collected unemployment. I\ndo not find that he was attempting to mislead the Government with this omission.\nMitigation\nApplicant submitted 15 character letters from many individuals with high level\npositions, including a President/CEO of a company and several Ph.Ds. These\nindividuals all wrote in extremely laudatory terms of Applicant\u2019s technical abilities, his\ncharacter, reliability, and integrity  (Exhibit C).\nThere were also submitted a number of awards received by Applicant and\nnewspaper articles written about him, confirming his significant scientific expertise\n(Exhibit D). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\n\n6\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant furnished to\nthe Government incomplete answers on an SCA that he executed on July 2, 2004. \nThe Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking\naccess to our nation\u2019s secrets. If such an individual intentionally falsifies material facts\nor fails to furnish relevant information to a Government investigator, it is extremely\ndifficult to conclude that he nevertheless possesses the judgment, and honesty\nnecessary for an individual given a clearance.\nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline E, DC 16. (a)\ncould be argued to be applicable if it is determined that Applicant\u2019s omission of relevant\nfacts from a personnel security questionnaire, which was used to determine security\nclearance eligibility, were deliberate. However, after reviewing all of the evidence,\nparticularly the testimony of Applicant and his affidavit ((Exhibit 4), I find his explanation\ncredible that the errors were inadvertent, rather than deliberate.\nRegarding his loss of employment, as alleged in 1.a., and 1.b., above, no\nevidence was introduced to establish that these resulted from questionable judgement,\nor an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \nI find that Applicant\u2019s conduct, considered as a whole, does not exhibit\nquestionable judgement, unreliability, or a lack of candor. I resolve Paragraph 1,\nGuideline E, for Applicant.\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why no disqualifying condition applies in this case, together with the\nextremely laudatory character letters and the awards and news articles admitted into\nevidence, I find that the record evidence leaves me with no significant questions and\ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole\nperson concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcerns.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  clearly\nconsistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On November 1, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement),\nGuideline K (Handling Protected Information) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).

Loughran denied Applicant\u2019s\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable decision under Guideline E is not at issue in this appeal.  \n1\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s conclusion that\nApplicant had failed to mitigate the security concerns in his case was error.   \n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an engineer for a\ndefense contractor.  He has been working with his current employer since 1984.  He first smoked\nmarijuana in his teens and continued to use it \u201csporadically until about 1982.\u201d  Decision at 2.  He\nwas interviewed for a background investigation in 1984 and, admitting his prior drug use, stated that\nhe did not intend to use illegal substances again.  He was granted a security clearance in 1985 and\nhas held one since that date.\nIn about 1987, Applicant began smoking marijuana again.  Subsequently, in 2001, he\nsubmitted a security clearance application (SCA), in which he said that he had smoked marijuana\n\u201cless than 168\" times between May 1985 and May 2001.  Applicant stated in his SCA that his\nmarijuana use was \u201cspiritual or medical\u201d in nature and that he no longer used it.  Id. at 3.  In 2003\nhe was interviewed as part of his background investigation.

Id.    \nIn 2004, Applicant resumed smoking marijuana.  On April 18, 2006, he submitted another\nSCA, in which he stated that he had smoked marijuana 84 times since May 2001.  Again, he stated\nthat he no longer used marijuana.  In 2008, Applicant was examined by a physician specializing in\naddiction medicine.

On none of these occasions was there a compromise of classified\ninformation.  Following each occasion, Applicant received additional training on security\nprocedures.\nThe Board has examined Applicant\u2019s appeal brief in light of the record evidence.  Applicant\nstates in his brief that, while \u201cit is understandable that the Administrative Judge could reach\u201d an\nadverse decision in this case, the Judge \u201ccould have also reached a different decision consistent with\nthe directive.\u201d  Brief at 2.  However, \u201c[a]n applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  ISCR Case No. 07-10454 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 12, 2008).  In light of\nthe record as a whole, the Judge has drawn a rational connection between the facts found and his\nultimate adverse security clearance decision.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun.\n\n2, 2006).  See also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

Green, Esq. \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns raised by his drug involvement \nand security violations. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn November 1, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline H, Drug Involvement; Guideline K, Handling Protected Information; and \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 27, 2007, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to another Administrative \nJudge on March 13, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 9, 2008, \nscheduling the hearing for May 21, 2008. Applicant requested that the hearing be \nJune 26, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nconducted in a different location. The case was reassigned to me on April 15, 2008. \nAnother notice of hearing was issued on May 20, 2008, and the hearing was convened \nas scheduled on June 4, 2008. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nJune 16, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nNotice \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nEvidence \n \nThe Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9, which were received without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called four witnesses, and offered \nExhibits (AE) A through R, which were received without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s \nrequest to keep the record open until June 11, 2008, to submit additional matters \nthrough Department Counsel. One document was submitted immediately after the \nhearing, marked as AE S, and admitted. Applicant submitted three documents after \nJune 11, 2008. The documents were marked AE T though V. AE U and V were admitted \nwithout objection. Department Counsel objected to AE T, a statement by Applicant \ndated June 13, 2008, on the basis that the statement amounted to additional testimony \nby Applicant without affording Department Counsel the opportunity to cross-examine the \nApplicant. The objection to AE T is overruled and it is admitted. The memo from \nApplicant\u2019s counsel is Hearing Exhibit (HE) I; Department Counsel\u2019s memo is HE II.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He has a Master of \nScience degree awarded in 1983. He has been with his current employer since 1984. \nHe is divorced with three children, ages 22, 20, and 15.1  \n \n \nApplicant first smoked marijuana when he was in his teens. He continued to use \nmarijuana sporadically until about 1982. He was interviewed for a background \ninvestigation on October 2, 1984, and provided a signed statement. He admitted his \ndrug use and stated \u201cI do not intend to ever use any illegal substance again.\u201d Applicant \nwas granted a security clearance in about January 1985, and has held once since.2  \n \n \nApplicant started smoking marijuana again some time after October 1984. He \nestimated that he started smoking marijuana again in about 1987. He submitted a \nSecurity Clearance Application (SF 86) on November 19, 2001. He admitted to using \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 79, 86, 100, 128; GE 1, 2. \n \n2 Tr. at 92, 101-102; GE 1, 2, 4. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nmarijuana while holding a security clearance \u201cless than 168\u201d occasions between May 1, \n1985 and May 1, 2001.3  He wrote: \n \n[T]he use was rare and infrequent and more of a spiritual or medical \nnature. I no longer do so. The number of times is an estimated maximum. \nNever was I under the influence during work. I never compromised \nnational security or safety of others. I have diligently worked to promote \nthe safety and security of my country.4 \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation on June 13, 2003, \nand provided another signed statement. He discussed his marijuana use in the \nstatement. He wrote: \n \nMy drug use involved pot and was used to relax and reduce stress. I live \nwhere it is not considered a terrible thing. I no longer smoke and have \nfound other ways to reduce stress and relax. Meditation and yoga work \nbetter and provide more clarity of mind. . . I did not get involved with \ngrowing, transport or sales of pot. If I use pot in the future it would need to \nbe prescribed by my doctor.5 \n \n \nApplicant started smoking marijuana again in about 2004. He smoked marijuana \nabout once a month until April 2006. He would smoke in his house. Some of the \nmarijuana was provided to him and some he purchased. Applicant submitted another \nSecurity Clearance Application on April 18, 2006. He admitted using marijuana on 84 \noccasions between May 1, 2001 and the date of the SF 86. He wrote that the \u201c[u]se was \nrare and infrequent and more of a spiritual/medical nature,\u201d and that he \u201cno longer [did] \nso.6  \n \n \nApplicant was evaluated on May 23, 2008, by a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.), who \nis certified by the American Society of Addiction Medicine. He found that Applicant met \nthe criteria for cannabis abuse without physiological addiction. He wrote: \n \nHe and I discussed this, and he recognizes his responsibility in his \ntreatment. As such, it is very likely that he can succeed in a program of \nrecovery, as highly functioning individuals (doctors and attorneys for \ninstance, for whom there is good data) have an extremely high success \nrate in staying clean and sober. Such a program might require [Applicant] \nto be in weekly psychological counselling for 3-5 years, submit to random \nobserved urine testing, attend 12-step meetings, and of course, agree not \nto use any mind altering substances. \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 103-107; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1. \n \n4 GE 1. \n \n5 GE 4. \n \n6 Tr. at 109, 128; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nIn summary, I believe [Applicant] has an excellent prognosis for recovery, \nas he clearly understands his need to embrace recovery to put his \ncannabis abuse in the past.7 \n \nApplicant stopped drinking alcohol as he is aware that he must stop using all \nsubstances. He submitted to drug tests on April 15, 2008, and May 12, 2008. Both tests \nreported negative for alcohol and controlled substances, including marijuana. He \nregularly attends Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings and is on track to attend 90 \nmeetings within 90 days. He is in treatment with a psychotherapist and will meet every \nother month with the doctor who performed his evaluation. He testified that he no longer \nassociates with anyone who uses drugs. He stated that he will never use illegal drugs \nagain and signed a statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any \nviolation.8   \n \n \nApplicant works in a secured area. The area has four doors, each protected by \ntwo locks. One lock opens with the swipe of a card. The secondary lock is secured by a \ncombination. The area also has an alarm system. When Applicant left the secured area \non the evening of May 25, 2005, the card lock was secured and he engaged the alarm \nsystem, but he left the secondary lock unsecured. Another employee later in the \nevening did the same thing. No classified information was compromised. Applicant \nreceived additional training as a result of the security violation.9  \n \n \nApplicant was the last to depart the secured area on the evening of September 8, \n2005. He set the alarm, but again left the combination lock unsecured on one of the \ndoors. There was no compromise of classified information. He was again directed to \nreceive additional training.10 \n \n \nA Security Monitor and Alternate Security Monitor are assigned to the secured \narea each week. Their duties are to ensure that no classified materials are left \nunattended, verify that the safes are secured, verify that the individual room card \nreaders are activated to prevent entry, secure the closed area by securing the \ncombination spin dial door lock, test the card readers, activate the alarms, and issue the \nlast-one-out badge ensuring the area is secured for the night. Applicant was assigned to \nbe the Security Monitor on December 5, 2005. He again set the alarm, but left the \ncombination lock unsecured on one of the doors. He also failed to issue the last-one-out \nbadge. There was no compromise of classified information. He was again directed to \nreceive additional training. Applicant has not had any subsequent security violations.11 \n                                                          \n7 AE R. \n \n8 Tr. at 93, 118-127; AE N-V. \n \n9 Tr. at 82-85,129; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 6-9. \n \n10 Id. \n \n11 Id. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThree co-workers and Applicant\u2019s sister testified on his behalf. Numerous \ncharacter letters were also submitted. He is described as honest, intelligent, truthful, \ndedicated, trustworthy, and a man of integrity. His performance appraisals are \nexcellent.12  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n                                                          \n12 Tr. at 19-77; AE A-M. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 24:   \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nDrug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates \nfrom approved medical direction.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) any drug abuse;   \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.13  \n \n \nApplicant purchased and used marijuana while holding a security clearance. That \nraises the above potentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \nThree Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n \n \n                                                          \n13 Applicant was diagnosed with cannabis abuse, which could raise AG \u00b6 26(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a \nduly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or \ndrug dependence.\u201d This was not alleged in the SOR and is not considered for disqualifying purposes, but \nwill be considered under the whole person. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional.  \n \n \nApplicant admitted to using illegal drugs up until April 2006. His drug use was too \nrecent and too extensive for him to receive the benefit of AG \u00b6 26(a). He has not used \ndrugs since April 2006. He no longer associates with people who use drugs. He signed \na statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation. AG \u00b6 \n26(b) is applicable. Applicant has not completed a prescribed drug treatment program, \nbut he has a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. AG \u00b6 26(d) is \npartially applicable. \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Handling Protected Information \nis set out in AG \u00b6 33: \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nprotecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an \nindividual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 34 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \nsensitive information; and \n \n(h) negligence or lax security habits that persist despite counseling by \nmanagement. \n \n \nApplicant committed three very similar security violations in 2005. The above \ndisqualifying conditions have been established.  \n\n \n8 \n \nConditions that could mitigate Handling Protected Information security concerns \nare provided under AG \u00b6 35. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; and \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training. \n \nThere is no evidence that the violations were due to improper or inadequate \ntraining. AG \u00b6 35(c) is not applicable. It has been about two and a half years since the \nlast violation. There has not been a recurrence of the problem. There are indications \nfrom the evidence, including the witnesses\u2019 testimony and statements, that Applicant \nnow demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of his security \nresponsibilities. AG \u00b6\u00b6 35(a) and 35(b) have been raised as factors for consideration. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable:  \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n \nApplicant told DoD personnel on several occasions that he would not use illegal \ndrugs in the future, and then went back to using them again while holding a security \nclearance. There is no evidence that he purposely lied in those statements. He simply \nwas unable to keep his promises. It is, however, personal conduct that could create a \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) has been established. \n\n \n9 \n \nConditions that could mitigate Personal Conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nThe discussion under the guideline for Drug Involvement is equally appropriate \nfor this guideline. Because of his repeated broken promises that he would refrain from \ndrug use, I am unable to find the conduct is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) are \nnot applicable. Applicant has been open and honest about his drug use and has not \nused illegal drugs in more than two years. This has reduced his vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 17(e) is applicable.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant used illegal drugs for \nmany years while holding a security clearance. On three separate occasions he stated \nhe would not use drugs again, and then went back to using drugs. He now states for a \n\n \n10 \n \nfourth time that he will not use drugs again. His assertions simply cannot be taken at \nface value. \n \nApplicant committed three security violations in 2005. Security violations are one \nof the strongest possible reasons for denying or revoking access to classified \ninformation, as they raise very serious questions about an applicant\u2019s suitability for \naccess to classified information. Once it is established that an applicant has committed \na security violation, he or she has a very heavy burden of demonstrating that he or she \nshould be entrusted with classified information. Because security violations strike at the \nvery heart of the industrial security program, an Administrative Judge must give any \nclaims of reform and rehabilitation strict scrutiny. In many security clearance cases, \napplicants are denied a clearance for having an indicator of a risk that they might \ncommit a security violation (e.g., alcohol abuse, delinquent debts or drug use). Security \nviolation cases reveal more than simply an indicator of risk.14 The frequency and \nduration of the security violations are also aggravating factors.15 Despite his favorable \ncharacter evidence, Applicant has not met his heavy burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to continue his security clearance.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug use \nand security violations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline K:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n                                                          \n14 ISCR Case No. 03-26888 (App. Bd.

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke her\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on December 13, 2007. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of\nfinancial problems and under Guideline E for personal conduct based on workplace\nmisconduct. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided for Applicant.\nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nMay 29, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s two Answers were received in January and February 2008, and she\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on March 7, 2008. The hearing took\nplace as scheduled on April 17, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 25,\n2008.\nThe record was kept open until May 2, 2008, to allow Applicant an opportunity to\nsubmit additional documentary evidence. She timely submitted post-hearing matters,\nwhich were forwarded by department counsel without objections. The post-hearing\nmatters are admitted as follows: (1) Exhibit B\u2013HUD settlement statement; and (2)\nExhibit L\u2013cover letter with two receipts. \nProcedural Rulings\nAt the close of the evidence, the government moved to withdraw the allegation in\nSOR \u00b6 1.j, which concerns the garnishment for the state tax debt because it was related\nto the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.i, which concerns the lien for the state tax debt (Tr.\n106\u2013107). The motion was granted without objections, and the matters will be\naddressed together. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges a history of financial problems as follows: (1)\na 1994 Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, which was successfully completed and discharged\nin 1999; (2) a 2003 Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, which is ongoing under a five-year\nplan; (3) five collection accounts in amounts ranging from $16 to $208 for a total of\n$419; (4) a 2004 garnishment by her employer for $2,000; and (5) a state tax debt of\n$934, which was satisfied in 2000 and the lien was released in 2001. Under Guideline\nE, the SOR alleges workplace misconduct in 2005 by using a company credit card for\npersonal use. Applicant\u2019s Answer was mixed. Based on the record evidence as a whole,\nthe following facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for\nthe same company for about the last 20 years (Exhibit H). Her current job title is product\ndata management specialist (Exhibit I). She is seeking to retain an industrial security\nclearance that she has held for many years.  \n\n3\nApplicant married in 1990, but she and her husband separated in 1993. A divorce\nwas not finalized until 1997. Applicant is the mother of a nine-year-old son whom she is\nnow adopting via the legal process. The child\u2019s birth mother is a relative who was\nunable to care for the child. Applicant has had physical custody of the child since a few\ndays after his birth and has raised the child as her own. Applicant does not receive any\nchild support for her son. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, which she does not dispute\n(Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). The matters alleged in the SOR are established by\nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the admitted documentary evidence. The Guideline F\nallegations can be organized into five areas or items of concern and each is addressed\nbelow. \nThe first item of concern is the 1994 Chapter 13 bankruptcy case (SOR \u00b6 1.b)\n(Exhibit 6). This event stemmed from Applicant\u2019s separation in 1993. The case\ncommenced in August 1994, the plan was confirmed in December 1994, and the case\nwas concluded to the satisfaction of the court in December 1999. Excluding court costs\nand legal fees, Applicant paid about $31,462 to the trustee for the benefit of creditors in\nthe plan. \nThe second item of concern is the 2003 Chapter 13 bankruptcy case (SOR \u00b6 1.a)\n(Exhibits 2, 3, D, E, F, and G). This event stemmed from Applicant falling behind on\nsome payments (for example, a car loan) as well as a recommendation from an\ninvestigating agent who suggested she consider bankruptcy (Tr. 76\u201379). The plan was\ncommenced in July 2003 and confirmed in October 2003. The five-year plan calls for\nApplicant to pay $134 biweekly for the benefit of several creditors. As of January 2,\n2008, Applicant had paid a total of $15,410 toward the plan, and it appears she is on\ntrack to complete the plan in about October 2008 (Exhibit G). \nNext are the five collection accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c\u20131.g). In general, Applicant\nbelieves she resolved these accounts when she bought and closed on a home in July\n2007. \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f are medical accounts for $48, $16, and\n$87. Applicant maintains she has paid these debts (Tr. 56\u201359, 61\u201363). All three appear\nas collection accounts in a July 2006 credit report (Exhibit 5). The $48 and $16 debts\nappear as collection accounts in a November 2007 credit report (Exhibit 4). And none of\nthe debts appear in the most recent December 2007 credit report (Exhibit C). Applicant\nalso submitted proof-of-payment for $48 and $16 debts (Exhibit L). Accordingly, I find\nthese three debts are resolved. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e is a telephone account for $208. Applicant established this\naccount for her sister, and her sister has paid it (Tr. 59\u201361). This debt appears as a\ncollection account in the July 2006 credit report (Exhibit 5). But it does not appear in the\nmore recent credit reports from 2007 (Exhibit 4 and C). Accordingly, I find this debt is\nresolved.\n\n In general, a garnishment is usually a legal proceeding taken incident to a judgment obtained in a case and\n3\nis used to obtain satisfaction of the judgment by reaching credits or property of the debtor. Ordinarily, an\nemployer cannot garnish an employee\u2019s wages without a court order.  \n4\nThe debt is SOR \u00b6 1.g is a collection account for $60. It was paid when Applicant\nsettled on her house in July 2007 (Exhibit B). Accordingly, I find this debt is resolved.\nThe fourth item of concern is a so-called garnishment  of $2,000 taken by\n3\nApplicant\u2019s employer in 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). This allegation is inaccurate because it is\nbased on Applicant\u2019s mistaken belief that her employer garnished her wages as she\nreported on her security-clearance application in response to Question 34 (Exhibit 1).\nInstead, what took place is her employer deducted money from her salary that it had\nadvanced to pay for education when she did not earn the required grades (Tr. 63\u201365;\nExhibit J). The so-called garnishment is not reflected in any of the credit reports.\nAccordingly, I find this debt was never a genuine garnishment and it is resolved. \nThe fifth item of concern is the state tax debt that resulted in a lien and a writ of\ngarnishment (SOR \u00b6 1.i). Applicant believes the tax debt goes back to 1993 or 1994\nwhen she was going through her divorce (Tr. 65\u201368). The state obtained a judgment\nand filed a lien in 2000 and it was paid via a garnishment of Applicant\u2019s salary (Exhibit\nA). The 2006 credit report shows the lien was released in March 2001 (Exhibit 5).\nNeither the tax debt nor the lien is reflected in the credit reports from 2007 (Exhibits 4\nand C). Accordingly, I find this debt is resolved. \nUnder Guideline E, the concern is the workplace misconduct in 2005 when she\nused a company credit card for personal use (SOR \u00b6 2.a) (Tr. 80\u201388). As a result, she\nwas suspended from work without pay for one week and placed her on probation for\none year. She repaid the money, and she served the suspension and probation without\nincident. No similar incidents have taken place. She received an overall assessment of\naverage (met expectations) in a December 2007 performance assessment (Exhibit I).\nAnd in March 2008, she received a salary increase from $55,800 to $58,100 (Exhibit K).\nIn addition to the pay raise, Applicant\u2019s overall financial condition is relatively\nstable. She qualified for a home loan and completed the transaction in July 2007\n(Exhibit B). She is current with her monthly mortgage payments of $1,143. To earn extra\nmoney, she sometimes works a part-time job making flower arrangements (Tr. 73). She\nhas about $1,400 in a savings account (Tr. 74). Her December 2007 credit report\ndiscloses five accounts, four of which are current. One account is an auto loan that is\nbeing addressed by the Chapter 13 payment plan. She has three credit card accounts,\ntwo with small balances and one with a zero balance. All three are current. A new\ncollection account for $113 opened in September 2007. Applicant believes this debt is\nfor a medical bill and she is working to address it.  \n\n Department of Navy v.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n13\n5\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.4\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n5\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n6\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n7\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n8\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n9\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n10\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n11\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.12\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.13\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n14\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n15\nconditions under Guideline F). \n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n16\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n17\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n18\n DC 4 is \u201cdeceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income\n19\ntax evasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional breaches of trust.\u201d\n6\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n14\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n15\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n16\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. Her history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations\n17\n18\nwithin the meaning of Guideline F. The two Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases, the state tax\ndebt, and the collection accounts are more than sufficient to establish these two\ndisqualifying conditions. In addition, using the company credit card for personal use is a\ndeceptive financial practice within the meaning of Guideline F.  To sum up, the\n19\nevidence as a whole supports a conclusion of financial irresponsibility. \n\n Revised Guidelines at 14. \n20\n7\nThe guideline provides that certain conditions  may mitigate security concerns.\n20\nThe six mitigating conditions are as follows: \nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and,\nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\nMC 2 and MC 4 receive favorable consideration and are discussed below; the others do\nnot apply to the facts and circumstances here. \nMC 2\u2014conditions largely beyond a person\u2019s control\u2014applies in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nThe separation and divorce were factors in Applicant\u2019s financial problems and were\nlargely beyond her control. She has acted responsibly under the circumstances by\npaying off the state tax debt, by paying off the collection accounts, and by resolving her\nfinancial problems via Chapter 13 bankruptcy payment plans as opposed to walking\naway from her debts via a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. She completed the first Chapter 13\nplan in 1999 after paying more than $30,000 to creditors. In about October 2008, she is\nexpected to complete the second Chapter 13 plan after paying about $17,000 to\ncreditors.  \nMC 4\u2014good-faith effort to repay\u2014applies in Applicant\u2019s favor. She paid the state\ntax debt several years ago. She resolved the collection accounts when she bought a\nhome in 2007. She successfully completed the first Chapter 13 payment plan in 1999.\nShe is on track to successfully complete the second in about October 2008, about five\n\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n21\nconditions).  \n Revised Guidelines at 10.\n22\n DC 6 is \u201cviolation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to the employer as a condition\n23\nof employment.\u201d \n See MC 3 is \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it\n24\nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n8\nmonths from now. Assuming she completes both Chapter 13 plans, she will have paid a\ntotal of about $48,000 to creditors, a sizeable sum. She is not overextended as\nevidenced by a monthly mortgage payment of $1,143, which is about 24% of her gross\nincome, a figure that follows the rule-of-thumb that the total mortgage payment should\nnot exceed 28% of pretax income. In addition, she is raising a son as a single parent\nwithout the benefit of child support. Her current financial situation is not pristine (for\nexample, the recent $113 collection account), but it is also clear that she is doing the\nbest she can under challenging circumstances. Taken together, these circumstances\nare sufficient evidence of initiating a good-faith effort within the meaning of the\nguideline. \nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and\n21\ncredible adverse information that may not be enough to support action under any other\nguideline. In particular, a security concern may arise due to:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n22\nAt issue here is Applicant\u2019s 2005 workplace misconduct by using a company\ncredit card for personal use. Although this matter is covered under Guideline F as a\ndeceptive financial practice, it raises security concerns under Guideline E as well. In\ngeneral, her workplace misconduct involves questionable judgment and dishonesty. In\nparticular, when Applicant used the company credit card for personal use she violated\nan agreement between her and her employer within the meaning of Guideline E.  \n23\nSince this event in 2005, she served her suspension and probation without\nincident. She has received a good performance assessment for 2007 and a pay raise in\n2008. She has worked for this employer for 20 years and intends to continue working\nthere. On balance, Applicant\u2019s workplace misconduct in 2005 was an aberration and it is\nmitigated by the passage of time without recurrence.   \n24\n\n See Revised Guidelines at 3.\n25\n9\nTo sum up under the whole-person concept, Applicant is a 44-year-old employee\nwho has held a security clearance for about 20 years. She has a well-established\nhistory of financial problems and a related incident of workplace misconduct. Based on\nthe evidence as a whole, she has: (1) cooperated and voluntarily reported the\ninformation; (2) been truthful and complete in responding to questions; (3) resolved or\nappears likely to resolve the financial problems soon by completing the Chapter 13 plan\nin 2008; and (4) demonstrated positive changes in her workplace behavior as evidenced\nby the 2007 performance assessment and the 2008 pay raise.  These circumstances\n25\nare considered favorable to Applicant.\nAfter weighing the evidence as a whole, I conclude the favorable evidence\noutweighs the unfavorable evidence. Although she did not present a perfect case in\nmitigation, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the security concerns. Applicant met her ultimate burden of persuasion to\nobtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.i:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with national interest  to\ngrant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted. \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nMichael F. Fasanaro, Jr., Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 8, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On December 23, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline H are not at issue in this appeal.  \n1\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to consider record\nevidence favorable to Applicant and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   Finding no error, we affirm.\n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a welder employed by\na federal contractor.  He has held a security clearance since 2004.  \nApplicant was interviewed by security investigators in November 2006 and December 2007.\nDuring the interviews, he admitted testing positive for marijuana use in a random urinalysis\nconducted in March 2006.  However, in the December interview, he attributed the positive result to\npassive inhalation of second-hand marijuana smoke.  In a subsequent interview, and during the\nhearing, Applicant admitted that he had knowingly smoked marijuana prior to the urinalysis.  He\nadmitted that he did not correct the interview summary when he had the opportunity.  \n\u201cApplicant was nervous and sometimes argumentative during the hearing . . .

As stated above, the Judge\nmade findings concerning the esteem Applicant enjoys for his work performance and related\nqualities.  The Judge also mentioned this high regard in the whole-person analysis of the decision.\nHowever, the Judge plausibly explained why these matters were not enough to mitigate a security\nconcern arising from Applicant\u2019s false statement regarding his marijuana use.  \u201c[Applicant\u2019s]\nreaction to repeated questioning raises doubt about his reliability and good judgment.  Given the\ndemanding and sensitive nature of his work, he can expect to be questioned in the future about his\nwork and matters affecting national security.  His reaction to repeated questioning about his\nmarijuana use raises doubt about his willingness to provide full, frank, and truthful answers.\u201d\nDecision at 9.    \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 16, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, \nand 1.f. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings \nof fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old welder employed by a federal contractor. His duties \ninvolve repair work on U.S. Navy submarines (Tr. 22-23). He has worked for his current \nemployer since October 2002. He has held a clearance since February 2004.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s senior project manager rates him as one of the most reliable, \ndevoted, and skilled members of his team (AX B). His project manager describes him as \nhard-working, skilled, and dedicated (AX C). His production manager considers him \nvery mature, exceptionally skilled, responsible, and dependable (AX D at 1). His \nperformance evaluation for the period ending on December 15, 2008, rated him as 4.52 \non a 5-point scale, with top ratings in quality of work, quantity of work, and creativity (AX \nD at 4-5). His most recent project performance review gives him the top rating in all \ncategories AX D at 2).  \n \n \nApplicant was raised in a military family. His father retired from the U.S. Navy as \na master chief petty officer (Tr. 29). Applicant was married in October 2003. He and his \nwife have two daughters, ages six and three (Tr. 22). His wife submitted a statement \ndescribing him as a devoted husband and father, a man of great integrity and high \nmorals, and a person who takes great pride in what he does at work or at home (AX A).  \n \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted he used marijuana about five \ntimes from approximately 1996 until 2000, when he was in high school. At the hearing, \nhe testified he used marijuana a \u201ccouple of times\u201d in high school (Tr. 40). When he \nsubmitted his security clearance application on April 18, 2006, he disclosed that he \nused marijuana once on March 29, 2006, but he did not disclose his marijuana use in \nhigh school. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nDuring an interview with a security investigator in November 2006, Applicant \nstated that he had tried marijuana \u201cin the beginning of high school,\u201d and he had taken a \ncouple puffs of a marijuana cigarette at a family gathering in April 2006, but these were \nthe only times he had used marijuana. He also told the investigator that he underwent a \nrandom urinalysis about a week later and it indicated a very low level of the metabolite \nof marijuana (GX 2 at 8).  \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by another security investigator on December 21, \n2007. The summary of the interview indicates that he told the investigator he used \nmarijuana five times and his last use was during his senior year in high school (GX 5 at \n3). He admitted testing positive for marijuana in a random urinalysis in March 2006, but \nhe attributed the positive results to passive inhalation of second-hand marijuana smoke \n(GX 5 at 2).  \n \nIn May 2008, Applicant was interviewed by a third investigator. Applicant \ndescribed the same sequence of events, except that he stated they occurred in April \n2005 instead of April 2006. He admitted intentional use of marijuana and did not claim \npassive inhalation (GX 4 at 4-5). He told the investigator he decided to stop using \nmarijuana after April 2005 out of concern for his wife and children (GX 4 at 5).  \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified he used marijuana in April 2006, but he denied \nusing marijuana in 2005. He also testified he did not use marijuana between 2000 and \nApril 2006 (Tr. 34). He testified that the interview summary reflecting marijuana use in \n2005 was incorrect (Tr. 44-45). He also testified that the interview summary claiming \npassive inhalation was incorrect, but he admitted he did not correct the interview \nsummary when he had the opportunity. He first testified he probably did not correct it \nbecause he did not read it thoroughly (Tr. 47-48), but he later admitted telling the \ninvestigator that he passively inhaled it (Tr. 55). He admitted that he placed his initials \nnext to the word \u201cinhaled\u201d on the interview summary (Tr. 56).  \n \n \nWhen questioned by his attorney about the passive-inhalation explanation, \nAppellant testified: \u201cI\u2019m saying that I didn\u2019t disclose with [the investigator] that I had used \nmarijuana, because I had already disclosed it with everybody else, numerous times. \nThis was over a year later, and probably five interviews that you don\u2019t even have copies \nof.\u201d On further questioning by his attorney, he testified he told the false passive-\ninhalation story because he felt he had already told the truth to everyone (Tr. 50, 55).  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana on February \n18, 2007, while fishing with friends. He testified the police officer claimed she smelled \nmarijuana, and he said \u201ca couple of smart things\u201d in reply (Tr. 32). Applicant denied \nusing marijuana on this occasion, and there is no evidence in the record to the contrary. \nAccording to Appellant, he hired an attorney and appeared in court, but the charges \nwere dropped for lack of evidence (GX 4 at 4; Tr. 32-33). The court records reflect that \nthe charges were disposed of by nolle prosequi (GX 6).  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant was nervous and sometimes argumentative during the hearing. He \nconfused \u201cpositive\u201d with \u201cnegative\u201d and could not pronounce \u201cinterrogation.\u201d He spoke in \nrambling, sometimes disjointed sentences. His tone and demeanor reflected dislike for \nbeing questioned. He testified he found the whole process embarrassing (Tr. 28-31, 35-\n36, 51, 54). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \n\n \n5 \n \n \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant used marijuana about five times between \napproximately 1996 and at least 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); he used marijuana once in March or \nApril 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); he tested \u201cinconclusive\u201d for marijuana at his place of \nemployment in April 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); he used marijuana once in March 2006 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d); he tested \u201cinconclusive\u201d for marijuana at his place of employment in April 2006 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e); and he was arrested and charged with marijuana possession on February \n18, 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). \n \n \nDuring his closing statement, Department Counsel conceded that Applicant\u2019s use \nof marijuana and \u201cinconclusive\u201d urinalysis did not occur in March and April of 2005 as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, but instead they occurred in March and April of 2006. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s concession is supported by the record. Accordingly, I find for \nApplicant with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s arrest in February 2007 appears to have been prompted by his \n\u201csmart\u201d response to a police officer\u2019s question. It is consistent with the combative \nattitude he demonstrated at the hearing. The ultimate disposition of the charges \ndemonstrates that he was not guilty of marijuana use or possession in February 2007. I \nfind for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.f. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony establishes that the \u201cinconclusive\u201d urinalysis in April 2006 \nwas actually a positive result, but at a low level of concentration. His use of marijuana in \nMarch 2006, while holding a security clearance, and the detection of a low level of \nmarijuana metabolite in April 2006 are sufficient to raise the following disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any drug abuse (defined in AG \u00b6 24(b) as \u2018the illegal use of a \ndrug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction\u201d);  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25(b): testing positive for illegal drug use;  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia; and \n \nAG \u00b6 25(g): any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise these disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(a). The first prong of AG \u00b6 26(a) \n(Ahappened so long ago@) focuses on whether the drug involvement was recent. There \nare no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination \nmust be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. If the evidence \nshows Aa significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \nAchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.@ ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana in high school and then abstained until his one-time \nuse in March 2006. He has abstained from further use. He has a reputation for being \nfamily-oriented and an outstanding employee. He has demonstrated that he is \nrehabilitated. Therefore, I conclude that the first prong of AG \u00b6 26(a) is established.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent use did not happen under circumstances making it \nunlikely to recur, but it was a one-time event, followed by a long period of abstinence. \nUnder all the circumstances, it does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 26(a) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse \nany drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and \ncontacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an \nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b). The evidence establishes AG \u00b6 \n26(b)(3), but not AG \u00b6 26(b)(1), (2), or (4). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges Applicant falsified his security application by failing to disclose \nhis use of marijuana in March or April 2005. SOR \u00b6 2.b alleges he deliberately falsified \nmaterial facts when he told a security investigator that he did not use marijuana in \nMarch 2006, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, but he was in the presence of others using \nmarijuana and inhaled second-hand marijuana smoke. \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \nAG \u00b6 15 further provides that an unfavorable clearance action or administrative \ntermination of further processing will normally result from \u201crefusal to provide full, frank \nand truthful answers to lawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness \ndetermination.\u201d  \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security \nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \nand \nAG \u00b6 16(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information \nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, \ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. \nAn administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine \nwhether an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR Case No. \n03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nAs noted in the above discussion of Guideline H, the marijuana use in March or \nApril 2005, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, did not occur. Therefore, Applicant did not falsify his \nsecurity clearance application by failing to disclose it on his security clearance \napplication. I resolve SOR \u00b6 2.a in his favor. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s denial of voluntary marijuana use in his interview with a security \ninvestigator in December 2007 is more complicated. In an earlier interview in November \n2006, he had already admitted using marijuana with family members in March 2006. \nThe passive-inhalation story occurred during his second interview. In a third interview in \nMarch 2008, he admitted his marijuana use and did not repeat his passive-inhalation \nexplanation. His explanation at the hearing, that he had earlier told the truth, does not \nplausibly explain why he gave the false explanation to the investigator. The record \nevidence and Applicant\u2019s demeanor at the hearing suggest that Applicant was frustrated \nby the multiple interviews, and he gave the passive-inhalation story to the investigator \nfor the same reason he gave the \u201csmart\u201d response to the police officer in February \n2007. His false statement to the investigator in December 2007 raises AG \u00b6 16(b). \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers to an investigator\u2019s \nquestions may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). There is no evidence of any affirmative attempts by Applicant to \ncorrect the information he gave in December 2007. He did, however, correct the \nfalsification in his May 2008 interview, but his truthful answers in May 2008 fall short of \na prompt, good-faith attempt to correct the falsification. Thus, I conclude AG \u00b6 17(a) is \nnot established.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct also may be mitigated if \u201cthe \noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). \nApplicant\u2019s false statements to a security investigator were not \u201cminor,\u201d regardless of his \nmotivation for making them. They were recent and did not happen under unique \ncircumstances.  \n \n \nI am not convinced that Applicant\u2019s passive-inhalation story was his only \nfalsification during his security investigation. He was vague and inconsistent in \ndescribing the extent of his marijuana use from 1996 to 2000, admitting in his response \nto the SOR that he used it about five times during that period, but testifying he used it \nonly a \u201ccouple of times\u201d in high school. He told the investigator in November 2006 that \nhe last used marijuana \u201cin the beginning of high school,\u201d outside the seven-year window \ncovered by the security clearance questionnaire, but he stated in a later interview in \nDecember 2007 that his last use was during his senior year, less than seven years \nbefore he submitted his security clearance application. He did not disclose his high \nschool use of marijuana on his security clearance application. Because his failure to \ndisclose his high school use of marijuana is not alleged in the SOR, I have considered it \nfor the limited purpose of determining if the mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 17(c) applies \nand in my whole-person analysis. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006). \n \n \nUnlike the inconsistencies regarding his marijuana use in high school, Applicant\u2019s \npassive-inhalation story is a clear falsification. His decision to intentionally provide false \n\n \n9 \n \n \ninformation to a security investigator casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment, and it falls squarely into the \u201crefusal to provide full, frank, and truthful \nanswers\u201d contemplated in AG 15. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines H and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant is a relatively young man with a high school education. He has worked \nfor his current employer for more than seven years and is held in high regard. He has \nheld a clearance from almost six years. He is deeply dedicated to his family and his job \nHis use of marijuana in March 2006 has been mitigated, but his reaction to repeated \nquestioning raises doubt about his reliability and good judgment. Given the demanding \nand sensitive nature of his work, he can expect to be questioned in the future about his \nwork and matters affecting national security. His reaction to repeated questioning about \nhis marijuana use raises doubt about his willingness to provide full, frank, and truthful \nanswers.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concern based on his drug involvement, but he has \nnot mitigated the security concern arising from his false statements to a security \ninvestigator. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJames J. McKee, Esq.\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 26,  2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On January 17, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Edward W.\nLoughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is supported by substantial record evidence; whether the Board should take\nofficial notice of certain documents submitted for the first time on appeal; and whether the Judge\u2019s\nadverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Finding no error,\nwe affirm.\nThe Judge made sustainable findings that Applicant had six delinquent debts, totaling\n$19,691.  The record contained no evidence that these debts had been paid.  Applicant admitted each\nof these debts in her answer to the SOR, though for two of them, one for $8,948 and another for\n$4,035, Applicant stated she did not remember the debts.  She had experienced some unemployment\nfrom February 2001 until November 2002.  She has approximately $5,000 in a savings account and\nabout $200,000 in a 401(k).  \n The Board has examined Applicant\u2019s allegations of error in light of the entire record.  We\nconclude that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are based upon substantial record\nevidence.  See Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the record.\u201d)  Applicant has requested that the Board to take official notice of certain\ndocuments.  These documents constitute new evidence, which the Board cannot consider.  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.29.  See also ISCR Case No. 06-22871 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 24, 2008).  In any event, the\nmatters which Applicant has submitted do not constitute newly discovered evidence.  Rather, they\nare documents that were readily discoverable through the exercise of due diligence prior to the close\nof record.  See ISCR Case No. 06-22581 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 2, 2007).  See also Girault v. U.S., 135\nF. Supp. 521, 524 (U.S. Ct. of Cl. 1956).  In view of the fact that Applicant has $200,000 in her\nretirement account and nevertheless has not paid off her remaining delinquent debt, the Board\nconcludes that there is little chance that, had the documents in question been provided to the Judge,\nhe would have issued a different decision.\nViewed in the light of the record as a whole, the Judge\u2019s decision articulates \u201ca satisfactory\nexplanation for [his] conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found\u201d and his\nadverse decision.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  The record supports\nthe Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has not met her burden of persuasion that it is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with national security\u201d for her to have a clearance.  Decision at 7.  See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Accordingly, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s decision\nis not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \n\n3\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn July 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 7, 2007. She answered \nthe SOR in writing on August 23, 2007, and requested a hearing before an \nAdministrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on October 12, \n2007. The case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on November 7, 2007, \nand reassigned to me on November 28, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on \nNovember 28, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 17, 2007, \nat Woodland Hills, California. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9, which \nJanuary 17, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nwere received without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted \nExhibit (AE) A, without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open \nuntil January 4, 2008, to submit additional matters. On January 4, 2008, she submitted \nExhibit B, without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s memo is marked Hearing Exhibit \n(HE) I. The record closed on January 4, 2008. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on January 4, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated August 23, 2007, Applicant admitted all the \nfactual allegations, but stated she believed the debt alleged in \u00b6 1.f was a duplicate of \nthe debt alleged in \u00b6 1.d. She also provided additional information to support her \nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She is a technical \nschool graduate. Applicant has held a security clearance for more than 20 years. She is \ndivorced with no children. She lives with her boyfriend, who shares living expenses with \nher.1 Applicant has an extensive amount of delinquent debt. The SOR alleges six \ndelinquent debts totaling approximately $19,691. There is no evidence that any of the \nlisted debts have been paid. Individual debts are discussed below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a judgment entered against Applicant in about July 2000, for \n$8,948. In her response to interrogatories requesting information about this debt, \nApplicant wrote \u201c[t]rying to get itemization/information concerning this.\u201d Applicant \nadmitted to this debt, but testified she did not remember what the debt was for. It is \nlisted on the credit bureau report (CBR) of February 3, 2007, but not the CBRs of June \n18, 2007, October 12, 2007, or December 17, 2007.2 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is for a $4,035 judgment entered against Applicant in \nabout May 2001. Applicant wrote in her response to interrogatories, \u201c[t]ried to find more \ninformation but unable to find account # or address.\u201d Applicant admitted to this debt, but \nagain testified she did not remember the debt. This judgment is listed on all the CBRs in \nevidence.3 \n \n \nApplicant admitted to owing the $5,981 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c to a company \ncollecting on behalf of a bank which issued Applicant a credit card. Applicant\u2019s last \nactivity on this account was in January 2001. The debt is listed on the CBR of February \n3, 2007, but not the CBRs of June 18, 2007, October 12, 2007, or December 17, 2007.4 \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 34, 36-37; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 44-46; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2-5, 9. \n \n3 Tr. at 46-47; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2-5, 9. \n \n4 Tr. at 47; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1-5, 9. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f allege two medical debts of $328 each. SOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a \nmedical debt of $71. Applicant initially admitted to owing all the debts, but believed the \nsecond $328 debt was a duplicate. In her post-hearing submission, she stated she \ndiscovered that there were two separate debts for two visits to the same hospital. The \ndebts resulted from when she fell and dislocated her elbow on the way to jury duty. She \nwrote that she provided her insurance card but should have filed for workers\u2019 \ncompensation because she \u201cwas technically an employee of the court as a juror at the \ntime.\u201d She wrote that she tried to pay the bill at the hospital the day of her hearing but \nthe hospital was unable to accept payment.5 \n \n \nApplicant worked for a defense contractor, or its predecessor company, from \nabout 1982 until she was laid off in about February 2001. She obtained her technical \ndegree while unemployed. Applicant admitted that she went \u201ca little overboard\u201d in her \nspending before she was laid off. She was unemployed until she was rehired in about \nNovember 2002. She has worked for the same company since her rehire. Applicant \nwithdrew $30,000 from her 401(k) retirement plan when she was laid off. This initiated \nserious tax consequences. She stated she asked for the fees, penalties, and taxes to be \nwithheld in advance, and she asked to withdraw a sufficient amount that she would \nhave $30,000 after the withholding of the fees, penalties, and taxes. It is unclear \nwhether fees or penalties were withheld, but taxes were not withheld. Applicant\u2019s state \nand federal tax responsibilities arising from the withdrawal from the 401(k) were \nsatisfied in about 2005.6  \n \n \nApplicant testified that one of the reasons she has not paid the debts was that \nshe was very busy at work and her first priority was her job. She frequently worked \novertime and had a long commute. Her mother and her boyfriend have been ill, \nrequiring hospital stays and operations. Additionally a family member was killed in a \nnatural disaster on January 1, 2008. She stated she plans on paying her debts. She had \nan appointment with a debt consolidation company after the hearing, but was \nuncomfortable with the person and their fees and did not retain their services. She \nstated she would continue to seek a company to assist her in her debt resolution.7 \n \n \nApplicant has approximately $5,000 in her savings account and about $200,000 \nin her 401(k). Her pay statement from June 2007, revealed $381 deducted every two \nweeks for her retirement account.8 \n \n \n \n                                                          \n5 Tr. at 21-22; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2-5, 9; AE B. \n \n6 Tr. at 22-23, 41-44; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR. \n \n7 Tr. at 20, 25, 30-31; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; AE B. \n \n8 Tr. at 26, 34-35; GE 2. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant is very involved in helping animals. She assisted a number of sick and \ninjured animals over the years and took in several animals in need of rescue. This \nresulted in large veterinarian bills.9 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n                                                          \n \n9 Tr. at 27; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated several delinquent debts and was unable or \nunwilling to pay her obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and, \n\n \n6 \n \n \n (e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant currently has significant delinquent debt. She did not show proof that \nshe disputed or paid any of her debts. She was unemployed for a significant period from \n2001 to 2002, but she had delinquent debt before she was laid off. Her family members \nhave had medical issues. Her unemployment and the medical issues were conditions \nthat were largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control. However, she has been continuously \nemployed for more than five years. She paid her IRS debt but has done virtually nothing \nto pay the listed debts. During this time period she accrued about $200,000 in her \nretirement account, plus about $5,000 in savings, while ignoring her financial \nobligations. That is not acting responsibly under the circumstances. She did not make a \ngood faith effort to repay her creditors. She has made promises to begin a payment \nprogram, but she has not done so. There are not clear indications the financial problem \nis being resolved or is under control. Her overall conduct with her creditors casts doubt \non her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Based on my evaluation \nof the record evidence as a whole, I conclude no mitigating conditions fully apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was unemployed for an \nextended period from 2001 to 2002. She was unable to pay the debts she accrued \nbefore and during this period. However, she has been employed continuously since \n2002, and except for her debt to the IRS, has done very little to pay her debts. During \nthis period, Applicant\u2019s retirement account has grown to about $200,000. Accumulating \na nest egg is a good thing, but not while shirking one\u2019s financial obligations. Applicant \naccumulated personal wealth of approximately ten times the size of the delinquent debt \nshe has ignored. Applicant\u2019s displayed extremely poor judgment and her actions were \nirresponsible.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \nissues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings:  Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a\ndefense contractor.  Applicant was fired by Employer A in 2000 for continued violations of the\ncompany\u2019s internet policy; namely, viewing sexually explicit websites on his company computer.\nHe had previously been counseled about viewing pornographic websites on his company computer\nduring duty hours.\nWhile working for Employer B in 2001, Applicant accessed and viewed pornographic\nwebsites, and downloaded material from those websites, during work hours. His employer never\nfound out about this activity, which was prohibited by company policy.  \nIn 2002, Applicant was counseled by Employer C about his need to work on government\ncontracts instead of accessing pornographic websites on the company computer.  He received this\ncounseling after it was determined he had downloaded approximately 145 pornographic videos onto\nhis computer.  After this counseling, his computer activities were monitored by his employer without\nhis knowledge.  He was subsequently observed accessing pornographic websites and was fired.\nApplicant falsified material facts on an Electronic Questionnaire for National Security\nPositions (EQNSP) he executed in March 2006 when he lied about the reasons he was fired by\nEmployers A and C.  He lied because he was afraid that if he revealed he was fired for viewing\npornography on company computers, it might adversely affect his security clearance.\nApplicant also lied about the reason he was fired from Employer C during an interview with\nan OPM investigator in August 2006.  He lied because he was afraid that if he told the truth, it could\nadversely affect his security clearance.\nIn a signed, sworn statement he gave to a Special Agent of the Defense Security Service\n(DSS) in September 2007, Applicant stated that he could not state \u201cwith 100% certainty\u201d that he\nwould not access pornographic websites at his place of employment.  In response to the\ngovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM), Applicant stated that following his termination\nfrom Employer C, he promised his wife that he \u201cwould not risk losing employment by improperly\nusing company assets to access pornography at any future work place.\u201d  He further stated, \u201cThis\npromise is the main reason I have been successful in only using IT systems as allowed by the rules\nof the organization in which I worked since August 2002.\u201d  He also stated that he has recently started\ncounseling on his \u201cpornography problem.\u201d\n\n3\nOn appeal, Applicant argues that his disqualifying conduct and falsifications were \u201cisolated\nto this particular process,\u201d and resulted from his embarrassment and fear.  Because those events \u201care\nnow in the open and there is no longer any reason for [him] to conceal them,\u201d he requests that the\nJudge\u2019s adverse decision be reversed.  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge erred.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  In this case, Applicant admitted to the\nallegations in the SOR with explanation.  He elected to have his case decided on the written\nadministrative record and then filed a one-page response to the government\u2019s FORM.  As a result,\nthe Judge did not have an opportunity to question him about his conduct and omissions, and evaluate\nhis credibility in the context of a hearing.\nThe Board has examined the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole and concludes\nthat the Judge has drawn a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\u2019 under Guidelines E, M and\nJ and his adverse decision.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 17, 2007, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on December 7, 2007. Applicant filed an\nundated response to the FORM.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and\nexhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 52 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant was fired from his government contractor employer (Employer A) in\n2000 for continued violations of the company\u2019s internet policy; namely, viewing sexually\nexplicit websites on his company computer. He had previously been counseled about\nviewing pornographic web sites on his company computer during duty hours.\nWhile working for Employer B in 2001, applicant accessed and viewed\npornographic websites, and downloaded material from said websites, during work\nhours. His employer never found out about this activity, which was prohibited by\ncompany policy.\nIn May 2002, applicant was counseled by his employer (Employer C) about his\nneed to work on government contracts instead of accessing pornographic websites on\nthe company computer. He received this counseling after it was determined he had\ndownloaded approximately 145 pornographic videos onto his computer. After this\ncounseling, his computer activities were monitored by his employer without his\nknowledge. In August 2002, he was observed accessing pornographic websites and\nwas fired.\nApplicant falsified material facts on an Electronic Questionnaire for National\nSecurity Positions (EQNSP) he executed in March 2006 when he lied about the reasons\nhe was fired by Employers A and C. He lied because he was afraid that if he revealed\nhe was fired for viewing pornography on company computers, it might adversely affect\nhis security clearance.\nApplicant lied about the reason he was fired from Employer C during an interview\nwith an OPM investigator in August 2006. He lied because he was afraid that if he told\nthe truth, it could adversely affect his security clearance.\nIn a signed, sworn statement he gave to a Special Agent of the DSS in\nSeptember 2007, applicant stated that he could not state \u201cwith 100% certainty\u201d that he\nwould not access pornographic websites at his place of employment.\nIn response to the FORM, applicant stated that following his termination from\nEmployer C, he promised his wife that he \u201cwould not risk losing employment by\nimproperly using company assets to access pornography at any future work place.\u201d He\nfurther stated, \u201cThis promise is the main reason I have been successful in only using IT\nsystems as allowed by the rules of the organization in which I worked since August\n2002.\u201d He further stated that he has recently started counseling on his \u201cpornography\nproblem.\u201d\n \nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\n\n3\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set forth in\nParagraph 15 of the AG, and is as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nParagraph16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 16.a., the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\n\n4\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d may be disqualifying. Under\nParagraph 16.b, \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority,\nor other official government representative\u201d may be disqualifying. These disqualifying\nconditions are applicable because applicant intentionally provided false, material\ninformation on an EQNSP and to an OPM investigator.\nParagraph 17 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I\nconsidered each of them and conclude none apply.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set forth in Paragraph 30 of the AG,\nand is as follows:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nParagraph 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying: Under Paragraph 31.a., \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses\u201d may be disqualifying. And, under Paragraph 31.c., an \u201callegation or admission\nof criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted or convicted,\u201d may be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s multiple falsifications were\nfelonies under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Accordingly, these two disqualifying conditions are\napplicable.\nParagraph 32 of the AG sets forth conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. I have considered each of them and conclude none apply.\nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems\nThe security concern for use of information technology systems is set forth in\nParagraph 39 of the AG, and is as follows:\nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining\nto information technology systems may raise security concerns about an\nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the\nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and\ninformation. Information Technology Systems include all related computer\nhardware, software, firmware, and data used for the communication,\ntransmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or protection of\ninformation.\nParagraph 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying. Under Paragraph 40.e., \u201cunauthorized use of a government or other\ninformation technology system\u201d may be disqualifying.  Given applicant\u2019s use of his\n\n5\nemployers\u2019 computers to access pornography in violation of their IT rules and\nregulations, this disqualifying condition applies.\nParagraph 41 of the AG sets forth the conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. None are applicable. \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature man who has\na history of ignoring his employers\u2019 IT policies by accessing, viewing, and downloading\npornography onto his employers\u2019 computers. This conduct resulted in applicant being\nterminated from two employers, information applicant attempted to conceal from the\nGovernment. His conduct was intentional, serious, and frequent. Applicant has taken a\nbig step in the right direction by seeking counseling for what he describes as a\npornography addiction, but as he has admitted, he is not 100% certain he will be able to\ncomply with the IT policies of his employers in the future. Under the circumstances,\napplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from Guidelines E , J and M.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline M:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Sometime later, a\npolice officer approached her with a packet of cocaine and told her that he had found it\nin her purse.  The Applicant told the officer that the packet was not hers.  The\nApplicant\u2019s only explanation for the packet of cocaine that was allegedly found in her\npurse is that given her seating location at the bar earlier that night, the cocaine may\nhave been accidentally dropped into her purse by someone else.  She pled guilty to\nCount (1) with a disposition of Deferred Entry of Judgment for 18 months, and was\nordered to enroll in a drug program.  She pled No Contest to Count (3) and was\nsentenced to 180 days in jail, suspended, placed on three years probation, required to\npay a fine, and was ordered to complete a First Offender Alcohol/Drug Program.  Count\n2 was dismissed.    \nTwo days following the incident, upon returning to work, the Applicant\nimmediately reported the arrest and charges to her Manager.  A copy of the adverse\ninformation report indicates that the Applicant reported all of her charges including her\ncharge for Possession of a Narcotic.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A). \n\n3\nThe Applicant has never been arrested, charged or convicted of any other\noffense.  She expressed that the experience of her arrest was embarrassing, humiliating\nand horrifying.  (Tr. p. 41).  She has never used any illegal drugs in her life.  (Tr. p. 45).\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because she intentionally falsified material aspects\nof her personal background during the clearance screening process.\nThe Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) dated August 28, 2008.  Question 23(d) of the application asked the\nApplicant, have you ever been charged with or convicted of any offenses related to\nalcohol or drugs.  The  Applicant answered, \u201cYES\u201d and listed a DUI in October 2004.\nShe failed to list the charge of Possession of Narcotic.  (See Government Exhibit 1).\nThe Applicant explained that she did not disclose her charge for Possession of Narcotic\nbecause she was told by her attorney and the Judge that after completing her diversion\nclass she would never have to answer \u201cyes\u201d to a question concerning whether she was\never charged with a drug related offense.  The Applicant explained that she answered\n\u201cyes\u201d in response to question 23(d) in regards to her alcohol charge.  (Tr. pp. 38-39).      \n   \nThe Government alleges that during an interview with an investigator from the\nDefense department on November 21, 2006, the Applicant omitted material facts when\nshe stated that he had been arrested and charged with an alcohol related offense in\nOctober 2004, and failed to mention the fact that she was charged with Possession of\nNarcotic.  For the same reason set forth above, the Applicant did not reveal this charge\nto the investigator.  \nTwo witnesses, a co-worker and a long time friend, testified on behalf of the\nApplicant.  They both find the Applicant to be highly trustworthy and reliable.   \nThree letters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s manager, a coworker, and\na friend, indicate that the Applicant is a person of high integrity who is honest and\nresponsible.  She is considered intelligent, diligent, and a conscientious employee.  She\nis an extremely hard worker who can be relied upon to perform a multitude of\nassignments.      \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\n\n4\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n30.  The Concern.  Criminal activity creates a doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n31.(a) a single serious crime or multiple offenses;\n31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n32.(a) So much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n32.(d) There is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.(a)  Deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\n\n5\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2\nof Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nto grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient\nperiod of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an\nacceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon\nthe individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is\nthe careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.\nAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\n\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in criminal conduct and dishonesty that demonstrates poor\njudgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has  engaged in criminal conduct (Guideline J) and dishonesty (Guideline E).\nThe totality of this evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness\non the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's\nconduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with her security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guideline J and E of the SOR.\nThe evidence shows that the Applicant was arrested on one occasion in 2004,\nover four years ago, and that she has never been arrested for any violation at any other\ntime.  On that occasion, she was convicted of drunk driving.  Although she was arrested\nand charged with Possession of a Narcotic, she adamantly contends that she has never\nused any illegal drugs in her life and that the narcotics that were found in her purse\nwere not hers.  There is no evidence in the record to the contrary.  Under Guideline J,\nCriminal Conduct, disqualifying conditions, 31.(a) a single serious crime or multiple\noffenses and 31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether\nthe person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted apply.  However,\nMitigating Conditions 32.(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\nand 32.(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement also apply. \n\n7\nUnder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, disqualifying condition 16(a), deliberate\nomission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities applies. Applicant\u2019s conduct under Guideline E has merit.  She believed\nat the time she answered the questions on her security application and during her\ninterview with the DoD investigator that she was being honest with the Government\nconcerning her arrest history.  She was advised that after completing the diversion\nprogram she did not have to admit to any illegal drug involvement of any sort.  Thus,\nshe did not deliberately try to conceal anything from the Government.  Consequently,\nthis allegation is found for the Applicant.  \nBased upon the evidence presented, I find that the Applicant did not deliberately\nfalsify her security clearance application, nor did she omit material facts during her\ninterview with the defense department.  What is crucial in this case is the fact that the\nApplicant did reveal this adverse information to her company security officer\nimmediately after it occurred.  She was under the reasonable assumption, be it\nerroneous or misinterpreted advice, that she did not have to list her drug charge on her\nsecurity clearance application or in response to questions during a security background\ninvestigation. \n       \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant has worked for the same\ndefense contractor for 32 years.  She has never received a security violation.  She is\nrespected and admired by her friends and colleagues.  Under the particular facts of this\ncase, the totality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole,\nsupport a whole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness, reliability,\ncandor, a willingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may properly safeguard classified information.  \nThis Applicant has demonstrated that she is trustworthy, and does meet the\neligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find for the\nApplicant under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct) and E (Personal Conduct).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR.  \n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required\nby Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Gomez, Esquire \nMcKenna, Long and Aldridge, LLP\nMarch 19, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY-ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF-86) on February 18,\n2005.  On September 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on November 13, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to\n\n2\nthe undersigned on January 9, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on January 31,\n2008, scheduling the hearing for February 19, 2008.  Administrative Notice was taken of\nthe political climate existing in the People's Republic of China.  At the hearing the\nGovernment presented two exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 and 2.  The\nApplicant presented twenty-six exhibits, referred to as Applicant's Exhibits A through Z.\nHe also testified on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on\nFebruary 27, 2008.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 43 years old and has a PhD in Engineering.  He is employed by\na defense contractor as an Engineer and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in\nconnection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant was born in the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1964.  He\nattended a University in the PRC.  At the age of twenty-four, in 1988, he came to the\nUnited States to further pursue his education.  At that time he was on a joint fellowship\nwith a University in the PRC and a University in the United States to do a three month\nresearch project.  The University in the PRC paid for his living expenses and the\nUniversity in the United States paid for his office and equipment.  He then applied to a\nPhD program at a University in the United States and attended there.  He became a\npermanent resident of the United States in 1993, and a naturalized United States citizen\nin 1999.  He possesses a valid United States passport.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit X).  \nIn 1993, he married a citizen of the PRC who later became a naturalized United\nStates citizen.  They have two children who were born in the United States.     \nIn 1996, the Applicant began working for his current employer.  He went through\na rigorous selection process and was selected as a technical fellow which is a fairly\nprestigious position within the company before one becomes an executive of the\ncompany.  Prior to working in the defense industry he was a assistant professor at a\nuniversity in the United States.   \nThe Applicant has several family members who are citizens and residents of the\nPRC that he maintains contact with.  His elderly mother, step-father, sister,\nbrother-in-law, an uncle and two aunts are citizens and residents of the PRC.  The\n\n3\nApplicant's mother, a retired factory worker, with an elementary school degree, also\nholds a green card from the United States.  She had planned on moving to the United\nStates until the Applicant\u2019s step-father was diagnosed with cancer.  She decided to stay\nin China to take care of him.  The Applicant speaks to her about four times a year.  The\nApplicant has strong feelings of affection for his mother.  The Applicant's father passed\naway in 1990.     \nHis step-father is a retired researcher formerly employed by a government owned\nsocial science institute, who was and still may be a member of the Communist Party.\n(See Government Exhibit 2).  The Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law may also be a member of\nthe Communist Party.  (See Government Exhibit 2).  In response to interrogatories\ndated September 4, 2007, the Applicant confirmed the accuracy of a personal statement\nhe provided the DoD on January 10, 2007.  He corrected several inaccuracies in the\nstatement on the addendum page but did not make any corrections concerning his step-\nfather and brother-in-law\u2019s association with the Communist Party.  In the statement, the\nApplicant indicates that his step-father and brother-in-law are members of the\nCommunist Party but that he does not know if they are actively involved in political\nmatters.  (See Government Exhibit 2).  At the hearing, however, the Applicant stated\nthat he had really never discussed the issue with his step-father and brother-in-law and\ndoes not know for sure if they are members of the Communist Party.  (Tr. p. 45).  His\nstep-father is a stranger to him.  (Tr. p. 47).  The Applicant stated that he does not have\nevidence to dispute the statement and he cannot possibly deny that they are not\nCommunist.  (Tr.p. 80).  In essence, they might be, the Applicant does not know.  (Tr. p.\n80).\nHis sister is a retired bus driver and an office clerk who receives a pension from\nher job.  The Applicant speaks to his sister by telephone about two or three times a\nyear.  (Tr. p. 53).  Her husband, the Applicant's brother-in-law is a road construction site\nmanager.   The Applicant does not consider himself to be close to his sister because he\nand his sister were raised separately.  He was raised by his parents and she was raised\nby their grand-parents.  (Tr. p. 54).  His sister and brother-in-law know that the Applicant\nis an Engineer and they know the name of the company he works for.   \nThe Applicant speaks to his uncle on his mom's side and his two aunts in China\nabout once a year or once every two years.  (Tr. p. 56).\nAt most once a year, the Applicant sends several hundred dollars to China to his\nfamily there.  (Tr. p. 44).  The Applicant has no assets or property, bank accounts, nor\ndoes he stand to inherit anything in China. \nThe Applicant has traveled to China on four separate occasions since 2000; in\nFebruary 2000, December 2003, June 2005 and January 2007.  On each occasion, he\ntraveled to China for the purposes of visiting his mother and sightseeing.  He has taken\nhis children to China on three occasions and they speak a little Chinese.  His mother\nhas visited him in the United States on two occasions.\n\n4\nThe Applicant's in-laws reside in the United States and they are naturalized\ncitizens of the United States.  The Applicant owns a home in the United States.  He also\nhas two separate retirement accounts from two different companies and some IRA\naccounts.  He has a banking account that includes both a savings and checking\naccount, and educational accounts for his children.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit R, S, T, U,\nV and W).   \nI have taken official notice of the fact that the People's Republic of China is a\nCommunist country and that its politics, society and human rights records remain\ninconsistent with United States system of democracy and freedom.  It is the most\npopulous country in the world, is economically powerful, and is an important trading\npartner of the United States.  It has strong military forces, and has its own\nforeign-policy.  The PRC engages in espionage against the United States through an\nextensive network of businesses, personnel, and specific programs designed to acquire\nadvanced U.S. military technology.  One approach is to covertly conduct espionage by\npersonnel from government ministries, commissions, institutes, and military industries,\nindependently of the PRC intelligence services.  This is believed to be the major method\nof PRC intelligence activity in the United States.  It also tries to identify ethnic Chinese\nin the United States who have access to sensitive information, and sometimes is able to\nenlist their cooperation in illegal technology information transfers.    \nNumerous letters of recommendation from professional and personal colleagues\nof the Applicant attest to the Applicant\u2019s intelligence, good judgment, reliability,\ntrustworthiness, dedication as an employee, loyalty and adherence to security rules and\nregulations.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A, B, C, D, E and F).   \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations for 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 reflect that\nhe either \u201cmet expectations\u201d, \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d or \u201cfar exceeded expectations\u201d in\nevery category.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibits I, J, K and L).  \nThe Applicant has received numerous awards for his outstanding contributions in\nthe work environment.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibits M, N, O, P and Q).\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\n\n5\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this guideline should consider th identity of the foreign country in\nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to,\nsuch considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States\ncitizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or\ncoercion.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \n\n6\nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \"clearly consistent with the\nnational interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"The adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\"Any determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\"\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence)\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\nand his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates that he has foreign connections may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United\nStates.  The mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate questions as to\nwhether the Applicant can be counted upon to place the interests of the United States\nparamount to that of another nation. The Government must be able to place a high\ndegree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and\nregulations, at all times and in all places.\n\n7\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and\nfactors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this\nAdministrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all\nallegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's foreign contacts have a direct and negative\nimpact on his suitability for access to classified information.  \nWith respect to Guideline B, the evidence establishes that he is vulnerable to\nforeign influence.  Disqualifying Condition 7.(a) contact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident\nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion applies.  None of the mitigating factors\napply. \nThe Applicant was born and raised in the People's Republic of China.  As an\nadult, at the age of twenty-four, he came to the United States to pursue better\neducational opportunities.  He was influenced by, and spent more than half of his life in\nChina.  His mother, step-father, sister, brother-in-law, uncle and two aunts, with whom\nhe maintains contact, are citizens and residents of China.  Although on the surface it\nappears that none of them are closely associated with the Chinese government or any\ngovernment, nor do they appear to be in a position to place foreign influence on the\nApplicant, or are in a position to be exploited by the Chinese Government or any\ngovernment in a way that could force the Applicant to choose between loyalty to them\nand loyalty to the United States, his sworn statement of his personal interview indicates\nthat his step-father and brother-in-law are members of the Communist Party.  This\npresents a risk that the United States cannot afford to take.  The possibility that the\nApplicant could have a close family member who is a member of the Communist Party\nis extremely alarming and places the United States at a heightened security risk.  The\nApplicant could be a target for an attempt at exploitation.  Furthermore, the Applicant\nhas traveled to China on four separate occasions within the last eight years, and has\ntaken his children to China on three occasions to visit their foreign relatives there.\nClearly, he has not cut his ties with China.  \nI have also considered the fact that the PRC is the largest collector of espionage\nagainst the United States in the world.  Their covert methods include extensive\nnetworks of businesses, personnel, and specific programs designed to acquire\nadvanced United States military technology.  The PRC tries to identify ethnic Chinese in\nthe United States who have access to sensitive information, and sometimes is able to\nenlist their cooperation in illegal technology information transfers.  Based on the\nforegoing, the Applicant's foreign contacts raise a significant security concern.\nGuideline B is found against  the Applicant.   \nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions\nof Guideline  B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.\n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:                \n                             \nParagraph 1: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n                     \n                        \nSubparas.     1.a.: Against the Applicant \n   \n   \n1.b.: Against the Applicant\n1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant\n1.d.:    Against the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n                                                                                     \n                                                                                                                                           \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJames N. Apostle, Esq.\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On December 28, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On June 24, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are supported by substantial record evidence; whether the Judge erred in his application of the\npertinent mitigating conditions; and whether the Judge erred in his whole person analysis.  Finding\nno error we affirm.  \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a 52-year-old linguist\nfor a defense contractor.  Born and raised in Sudan, he worked for a civilian business in that country.\nHe immigrated to the U.S. in the 1980s, becoming a U.S. citizen soon thereafter.  He retains dual\ncitizenship with Sudan.\nApplicant has five siblings who are citizens of Sudan.  One lives in a European country and\nrecently became a citizen of that country.  Another lives and works in a middle eastern country.  The\nremaining three reside in Sudan.  Applicant has weekly to monthly contact with his siblings.  He is\nmarried to a Sudanese woman who recently became a U.S. citizen.  Applicant and his wife have\nthree children.  His parents-in-law are Sudanese citizens residing in another country.  Applicant\u2019s\nwife maintains regular contact with them (about two times a month) and Applicant speaks with them\nhimself upon occasion.  Applicant\u2019s wife has six siblings who reside in Sudan.  She has other\nsiblings residing in other countries.  She has monthly contact with her siblings in Sudan.  \nThe U.S. State Department has designated Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism.  It is the\nsubject of trade restrictions.  Sudan has committed numerous human rights violations, and United\nNations peacekeepers report systematic rape of women and children in the Darfur region.  Other\nviolations include arbitrary arrest and detention, denial of due process, and trafficking in persons.\nThe Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are supported by substantial record\nevidence.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the same record.\u201d) To the extent that the Judge\u2019s findings contain error, the Board\nconcludes that such error is harmless.  For example Applicant argues that the Judge erred in stating\nthat Applicant pays $500.00 to his siblings living in Sudan.  This finding appears to have been based,\nat least in part, on Government Exhibit 2, Personal Subject Interview, at 5: \u201cSubject noted that he\nsends his siblings money to help out every month.  Subject noted that he sends $500.00 a month\ntotal.\u201d  Applicant points to his testimony that he had stopped sending the money after his siblings\nmarried.  Tr. at 43.  However, even if the Judge had made a finding on this matter consistent with\nApplicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing, such a finding would not likely have resulted in a favorable\n\n3\nsecurity clearance decision when viewed in light of the record as a whole.  See ISCR Case No. 06-\n23112 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 31, 2007).  \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred by not assigning sufficient weight to matters he\nbelieves favorable to his case, for example that his siblings live in a part of Sudan that enjoys relative\nsecurity.  However, \u201c[a]n applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence . . .\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 07-10454 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug.\n12, 2008).  Furthermore, the \u201cJudge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record\nunless he specifically states otherwise.  He is not required to cite or discuss every piece of record\nevidence.\u201d  See ISCR Case No.07-04504 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2008)(internal citations omitted).\nIn light of the record as a whole, the Judge has drawn a rational connection between the facts\nfound and his ultimate adverse security clearance decision, both as regards the mitigating conditions\nand the whole-person factors.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  See also\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The\nJudge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance\u201d is sustainable on this record.  Decision at 12.  Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)  (\u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted\nonly when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security\u2019\u201d).

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: James N. Apostle, Esq.\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn December 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 25, 2008, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on February 14, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on\nApril 9, 2008.  A hearing was held on April 9, 2008, for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny,\nor revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted\nof two exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and three exhibits.  The\nJune 24, 2008\n\n2\ntranscript (R.T.) was received on April 17, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified information is denied.\nBesides its two exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of 10\ndocuments:  Background Note: Sudan, U.S. Department of State (January 2008);\nCountry Specific Information, U.S. Department of State (August 2007) U.S. Department\nof State (August 2007); Travel Warning, Sudan, U.S. Department of State (September\n2007); The U.S. Response to the Darfur Crisis, U.S. Department of State (October\n2007);  Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2006, Sudan (March 2007); State\nSponsors of Terrorism, U.S. Department of State (November 2007); Country Reports on\nterrorism, Chapter 3 - State Sponsors of Terrorism Overview, U.S. Department of State\n(April 2007); Overview of Treasury and Commerce Regulations Affecting U.S. Exports to\nSudan, U.S. Department of State (March 2007); Blocking Sudanese Government\nProperty and Prohibiting Transactions with Sudan, Executive Order 13067), 62 Federal\nRegister 59989-59990 (November 2007); Blocking Property of and Prohibiting\nTransactions with the Government of Sudan, Executive Order 13412, 71 Federal\nRegister 61369-61371 (October 2006).\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for\nadministrative proceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 2007); ISCR\nCase No. 02-24875 (App. Bd. October 2006).  Administrative notice is appropriate for\nnoticing facts or government reports that are well known.   See Stein, Administrative\nLaw, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006).  For good cause shown, administrative notice was\ngranted with respect to the above-named background reports addressing the geopolitical\nsituation in Sudan.  Administrative notice was extended to the documents themselves,\nconsistent  with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evi.  This notice did  not foreclose\nApplicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the\nreports addressing Sudan\u2019s current state.  \nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged to (a) have a brother and three sisters\nwho are citizens and residents of Sudan; (b) send $500.00 a month to his siblings in\nSudan to assist them; (c) have a father-in-law and mother-in-law who are citizens and\nresidents of Sudan, (d) have a brother who is a citizen of Sudan and resides in the\nUnited Arab Emirates; and (e) have returned to Sudan in 1996 to marry his spouse.  For\nhis answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the allegations in the SOR without any\nexplanations. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 52-year-old linguist for a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted\nas relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant was born and raised in Sudan and attended high school there.  Between\n1973 and 1980, he was a professional soccer player; albeit, he never played for Sudan\u2019s\nnational soccer team (R.T., at 29).  For about 10 years (between 1976 and 1986), he\nworked for a civilian aviation company in Sudan (R.T., at 29, 87).  In 1986, he\nimmigrated to the U.S., and has had no further contact with his former Sudan employer.\nSoon after his arrival in the U.S., he began working part time jobs, and applied for U.S.\ncitizenship.  Applicant was sworn in as a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1990 (R.T., at 30).\nHe retains his dual citizenship with Sudan (see ex. 1).  Applicant has several years of\ncollege credits, but no degrees to date (R.T., at 28).  He expressed interest in returning\nto college at some time, but to date he has not done so.\nApplicant\u2019s parents are deceased (R.T., at 28-29).  He has three brothers and two\nsisters who are citizens of Sudan.  One brother owns a private business and resides in\nSudan (see ex. 2; R.T., at 36).  Another works for a private company, resides in the\nUnited Kingdom, and recently became a British citizen (R.T. at 35-38); and a third works\nfor a government sponsored agency in the United Arab Emirates (R.T., at 31).  Applicant\nmaintains weekly to monthly contact with his brothers and sisters (see ex. 2).  None of\nhis siblings have ever worked for the Sudan government or have any interests in politics\n(ex. 2).  And  no government or military officials have ever tried to exert any pressure or\ninfluence over his family and work (R.T., at 40-41).   Both of Applicant\u2019s two sisters\nreside in Sudan.  One is a kindergarten teacher who is married (R.T., at 32-33).  The\nother is a homemaker who is divorced (R.T., at 32).\nApplicant last traveled to Sudan in May1996 to apply for his spouse (W) to\nimmigrate to the U.S (see ex.2).  W was born and raised in Sudan but moved to Saudi\nArabia with her parents when she was 11 (R.T., at 64).  W attended Saudi schools\nthrough high school.  She earned an accounting degree from an Egyptian college.  After\nearning her degree, she returned to Saudi Arabia to work (R.T., at 65-67).  Applicant met\nW while he was working in Saudi Arabia and married her there in early 1996 (see ex. 1;\nR.T., at 67). \nAfter his marriage, applicant briefly returned to the U.S.  Applicant returned to\nSaudi Arabia in 1996 to file his application papers to bring her to the U.S.   The U.S.\nEmbassy refused to accept his marriage certificate and advised him that he needed to\nobtain a certified marriage certificate from a Saudi court.   Because he could not\nestablish residency in Saudi Arabia, the Saudi court would not certify his marriage\ncertificate either (R.T., at 41-42).  His only open choice at this time was to travel with his\nwife (who had a Sudanese passport) to Sudan to obtain a certified marriage certificate\nthat would enable him to bring her to the U.S.  Applicant obtained the certificate and\nreturned to the U.S. with W.  He has not been back to Sudan since his 1996 trip (R.T., at\n42).   Once W immigrated to the U.S., she applied for U.S. citizenship.  She became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen in June 2002 (ex. 1).\n\n4\nApplicant sends $500.00 a month to his siblings in Sudan for their necessities\n(see ex. 2; R.T. at 42-43).  He owns no real estate in Sudan and has no business\ninterests in the country (R.T., at 43).  He has three daughters from his marriage to W (all\nborn in the U.S.).  They attended public schools for several years, but currently attend\nprivate schools (R.T., at 46).  \nOnce qualified as a linguist for the Army, Applicant located to Iraq to work (in\nNovember 2005).  He worked in Iraq for a little over two years, translating Arabic\ndocuments to English, and English to Arabic (R.T., at 61-62).  He has never been\ncontacted by Sudan officials about taking adverse positions against the U.S. (R.T., at\n48).  He returned to the U.S. in August 2007 after his interim clearance was revoked.  He\nclaims no conflicting loyalties to Sudan, however, and would like to return to Iraq to\nfurther his linguist work.\nW\u2019s parents are Sudanese citizens by birth who currently reside in Egypt.  Her\nfather, once a communications engineer in Sudan, moved to Saudi Arabia in 1984 and\nwent to work for the Saudi military (R.T., at 71-72).  He retired in 2000 and to Sudan for a\nbrief period before moving to Egypt with Applicant\u2019s mother (a homemaker) about 10\nmonths ago (R.T., at 74).  He received a lump sum pension from his Saudi military\nemployer and receives no other pensions to Applicant\u2019s knowledge (R.T., at 75). W\nsends her parents $200.00 a month for necessities.  She maintains regular contact with\nthem (generally around twice a month).  Applicant talks to her parents occasionally when\nhe is at home (R.T., at 75-76).\nW last visited her parents in August 2007 (following their move to Egypt).  She\nvisited her parents in the Sudan only once since she immigrated to the U.S. (in 2001)\n(R.T.., at 77).  W has three brothers and three sisters, all of whom reside in Sudan.  The\noldest brother drives a bus for a private company (R.T., at 78-79).  Another brother is a\nbanker who has resided in Sudan since he moved there from Saudi Arabia in 2000 (R.T.,\nat 79).  A third brother recently graduated from high school in Sudan and is trying to\nopen his own insurance company (R.T., at 79).  W\u2019s remaining two brothers reside with\nher parents in Egypt.  Of W\u2019s three sisters, the oldest lives and works in Saudi Arabia.\nHer other sisters are homemakers who have resided in the U.S. since 2000 and 2002,\nrespectively (R.T., at 81-82).  W maintains monthly contact with her brothers in Sudan\nand Egypt, as well as her sister residing in Saudi Arabia (R.T.,at 83-84)  None of\nApplicant\u2019s brothers ever served in the Sudan military or government (R.T., at 86).  \nBesides his siblings, Applicant has a cousin, two aunts, and an uncle who reside\nin Sudan.  None work for the Sudan government.  He occasionally talks to these\nrelatives (who reside with his brother) when he speaks to his brother (R.T., at 94).\nApplicant has had no involvement in the civil strife that has consumed Sudan ethnic\ngroups for years (R.T., at 95-96).  He described most of the strife as confined to the\nsoutheast sector of the country (the Darfur region).  \nApplicant has no reason to believe any of his siblings and other family members\nresiding in Sudan are at any risk to influence or pressure from the Sudanese military and\n\n5\ngovernment officials (R.T., at 102).  He has not been to Sudan in many years and knows\nnothing about Sudan\u2019s intelligence service (R.T., at 103).  He has had no feedback from\nother linguists in his organization about Sudanese intelligence gathering.\nApplicant is highly regarded by his neighbors and coworkers who have worked\nwith him in Iraq (see exs. A through C).  All of his references express confidence in his\nreliability and trustworthiness.  \nSudan\u2019s country status\nWith one of the most diverse populations in all of Africa, Sudan is comprised of\ntwo major cultures-Arab and Black Africa-with hundreds of ethnic and tribal subdivisions\nand language groups.  This diverse population mix presents major challenges to\ncollaborative efforts.  See Background Note: Sudan, U.S. Department of State, at 2\n(January 2008).\nHistorically, Sudan was once a collection of small independent kingdoms and\nprincipalities, dating to the Christian era and ending with Egypt\u2019s vanquishing and\nunifying the northern sectors of the region in the 1820s (see id.).  Egypt never did\nestablish any effective control over the southern regions, which remained an area of\ndisparate tribes subject to frequent attacks by slave traders (see id.).\nFor a brief period in the early 1880s, Sudan was ruled by a religious leader who\nproclaimed himself the Mahdi.  The Mahdi had led a nationalist revolt against he\nOttoman-Egyptian government that culminated in the fall of Khartoum in 1885.  Despite\nhis death shortly thereafter, the Mahdi\u2019s state survived several more years before\nsuccumbing to an invading Anglo-Egyptian force under Lord Kitchener in 1898 (see id., \nat 3).   Following their successful invasion, Egypt and Britain administered Sudan jointly\nfor a number of years, with Britain assuming management control and policy formulation\nof Sudan (see id.).  \nIn February 1953, Britain and Egypt concluded an agreement that assured self-\ngovernment and self determination for Sudan (see Background Note: Sudan, U.S.\nDepartment of State, supra, at 3).  Since gaining its independence, Sudan has endured\ncontinuous wars within its borders.  Most of its civil strife is rooted in deep cultural and\nreligious differences that have stunted the economic and political development of its non-\nMuslim peoples to the South and West.  Northerners who have controlled the country\nsince independence have pursued uniting policies based on Arabism and Islam over the\nopposition of southerners and marginalized peoples to the South, East and West (see\nid., at 3-4).\nFollowing a brief return to civilian government after the overthrow of the\nrepressive Nimeiri regime, General al-Bashir and his Islam army faction mounted a\nmilitary coup and installed the National Islamic Front (see id., 4).  General al-Bashir\u2019s\ngovernment committed to Islamism, which only served to intensify the north-south\nconflict.  \n\n6\nUnder General al-Bashir\u2019s regime, Sudan became less and less responsive to the\ngrievances of Muslim and non-Muslim populations outside his northern political base.\nThe al-Bashir government continued its internal political repression against non-Muslim\ngroups and added its support to Islamist groups in Algeria, and to Iraq\u2019s invasion of\nKuwait (id., at 5).\nRegional efforts to broker a cessation of the Sudanese civil war between the north\nand south/west provinces of the country were numerous throughout the 1990s (see id.).\nDespite these brokered efforts, peace prospects in Sudan remained fairly remote by\n2001.  Peace prospects initiated in 2002, however, produced an executed declaration\nbetween the Sudan government and the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement/Army\n(SPLM/A) that committed the government and the rebel group to a final comprehensive\npeace agreement in December 2004 (see id.).\nIn January 2005, the al-Bashir government and the SPLM/A completed a\ncomprehensive peace agreement (CPA), establishing a new government of national\nunity and the interim government of Southern Sudan.  Implementation of key provisions\nby the peace agreement failed to materialize.  With the collapse of the peace agreement,\nrebellion in Darfur ensued.  This resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Darfur\ninhabitants and mass internal displacement of two million persons in the Sudan, and\n234,000 refugees in neighboring Chad (see id, at 6-8).  Without question, the Sudanese\ngovernment is complicit in the bombing, murder and rape of innocent civilians (which\ninclude women and children living in aid camps) in Darfur, and bears principal\nresponsibility.  See The U.S. Response to the Darfur Crisis, U.S. Department of State\n(October 2007).  The State Department charged President al-Bashir with demonstrating\n\u201ca continued refusal to honor his commitments to end the violence in Darfur (see id.).  \nSudan was designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. State Department\nin August 1983, and remains on the State Department\u2019s list of State sponsors of\nterrorism (see id., at 9).  Sudan is under a broad U.S. embargo, and is subject to the\nTreasury Department\u2019s extensive trade restrictions on exports and re-exports to this\ncountry.  See Overview of Treasury and Commerce Regulations Affecting U.S. Exports\nto Sudan, U.S. Department of State, at 1  (March 2007).   These restrictions were eased,\nbut not removed under the recently concluded Darfur Peace and Accountability Act (id.).\nExecutive orders issued by both President Clinton (E.O. 13067) and President Bush\n(E.O. 134120) cite Sudan\u2019s human rights abuses as proof of the country\u2019s posing an\nunusual continuation of a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the U.S.\nCompare E.O. 130687 (Blocking Sudanese Government Property and Prohibiting\nTransactions with Sudan, Executive Order 13067), 62 Federal Register 59989-59990\n(November 2007) with E.O. 13412 (Blocking Property of and Prohibiting Transactions\nwith the Government of Sudan, Executive Order 13412, 71 Federal Register 61369-\n61371 (October 2006).\nSudan today is governed according to a power sharing arrangement established\nby the January 2005 CPA, which was supposed to end the 22-year old civil war between\nthe north and the south.  See Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2006,\n\n7\nSudan (March 2007).  The CPA established an interim government of national unity,\nwhich is composed of the National Congress Party (NCP), and is dominated by Islamists\nfrom the north, and is ruled by an authoritarian president (Omar al-Bashir).  \nHuman rights continues to be a serious problem in Sudan. The State\nDepartment\u2019s report on human rights in the Sudan paints a grim picture. Despite the\nsigning of the CPA in 2005, sporadic violence continued to occur in the south (see\nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2006, Sudan, supra).  Militias aligned with\nthe SAF and the SPLM/A, as well as the increasing non-aligned militias, continued to\nwage violent attacks on each other\u2019s ranks in the Darfur region (see id.).  The al-Bashir\ngovernment bears ultimate responsibility for extraordinary human rights abuses that\nhave exploded on all fronts: rape, violence, hunger, displacement and looting.  Human\nrights abuses include harsh prison conditions, arbitrary arrest and detention, including\nincommunicado detention of suspected government opponents and prolonged pre-trial\ndetention, executive interference with the judiciary, denial of due process, widespread\nprostitution, trafficking in persons, and harassment of journalists and religious groups\n(id., at 8-12).\nRecent UN peacekeeping reports cite evidence of systematic rape of women and\nchildren in Darfur as particularly troubling.  The region today has rapidly turned into a\nvirtual free-for-all that has placed in jeopardy basic UN relief missions (see Country\nReports on Human Rights Practices - 2006, Sudan, supra, at 8-11).  While the al-Bashir\ngovernment and its loosely aligned militias have continued their attacks on local villages\nin the regions, Darfur has become a center of organized crime and warlordism that\nembraces marijuana-smoking rebels, disaffected government militias, and rogue bandits\nbrandishing AK-47 weapons.  All of these symptoms reveal how fragmented the fighting\nhas become in Darfur.  Where there were once two principal rebel groups (SPLM/A and\nJustice and Equality Movement (JEM)) in Darfur (id., at 1), there are now dozens, some\nwhich include Arab militiamen that once sided with the al-Bashir government.  \nAlong with rape and pillaging of women and children, the proliferation of banditry\nhas come to pose a major threat to UN-African Union humanitarian groups operating in\nthe region.  Carjackings, once rare, are now commonplace and victimize not only local\npopulations, but  major relief donors operating food distribution programs in Darfur.\nConditions today in Darfur indeed reflect a marked change from the beginning of the\nconflict in 2003, when the al-Bashir government unleashed its aggression to crush the\nrebels operating in the south and west of the country under the banner of ending\ndecades of discrimination by a government of Arab elites.  Though Arab and African\nethnicities are very intertwined in Sudan, the al-Bashir government fanned Arab\nnationalism and money as a way to rally the landless, Arab nomadic militias against their\nfarmer neighbors who identified themselves more as African.  U.S. efforts in pressing for\nstrong UN-African Union action have been largely frustrated by events and conditions\nthat have witnessed disillusioned janjaweed militia, abandoned by the government,\nactively joining forces with rebels and government soldiers in the expanding business of\nlooting, carjacking, and petty shakedowns (see Background Note: Sudan, U.S.\nDepartment of State, supra, at 7). \n\n8\nU.S. citizens are continually cautioned by the State Department to avoid travel to\nSudan.  See Travel Warning, Sudan, U.S. Department of State (September 2007).\nConsidered especially dangerous to U.S. citizens is the Darfur area (see id.).  Americans\nand other westerners have been targets of carjackings and armed robberies while\ntraveling in Sudan.  Terrorist actions may include suicide operations, bombings, or\nkidnappings (id.).  Travelers are reminded of reports of terrorist threats directed at\nAmericans and western interests in Sudan, and to avoid travel outside of the capital city\nof Khartoum and the adjacent town of Obdurman (see Country Specific Information, U.S.\nDepartment of State (August 2007).  Travel outside of these major cities remains\nhazardous (see id., at 2).  \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\nadministrative judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These\nGuidelines require the administrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and\nall of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the\nadministrative judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In\naddition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, administrative judges must take into\naccount the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in\nE.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to\nassist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided  loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under the this Guideline can and should considered the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism\u201d (see Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6).\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an\nApplicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that\nto do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\n\n9\nadministrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in\nthe record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance\ndepends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all\nadversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot\ndraw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons, and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security\nclearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nconsideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nANALYSIS\nBorn and raised in Sudan, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1990.\nHe married his wife in 1996 and brought her to the U.S. the same year.  She applied for\nU.S. citizenship shortly after her arrival in the U.S., and became a naturalized U.S. citizen\nin 2002.  Security concerns focus on Applicant\u2019s siblings who currently reside in Sudan\nand Saudi Arabia, respectively, and his wife and family members who have Sudan\ncitizenship and residency in Sudan and Egypt, respectively.  Applicant and his wife and\nfamily have deep roots in Sudan, a country historically known to practice terrorism and\ngenocide, and to exercise ruthless repression and human rights abuses against its own\ncitizens.\nThe Government urges security concerns over risks that Applicant\u2019s siblings and\nfamily members, as well as his wife and her family members residing in Sudan and Egypt,\nmight be subject to undue foreign influence by Sudan government authorities to access\nclassified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control.  Because Applicant and his\nwife have family members who have Sudan citizenship by birth and reside currently in\neither Sudan, or Egypt or Saudi Arabia, they present potential heightened security risks\ncovered by disqualifying condition  (DC) 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident\nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d of the Adjudication Guidelines for\nforeign influence. The citizenship/residence status of these family members in Sudan and\nneighboring countries pose some potential concerns for Applicant because of the risks of\n\n10\nundue foreign influence that could compromise sensitive or classified information under\nApplicant's possession and/or control. \nBecause none of Applicant\u2019s family or W\u2019s family have any identified prior military\nor government service, no consideration of DC 7(b), \u201cconnection to a foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s\ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information,\u201d is\nwarranted.  To be sure, from what is known from the presented evidence, none of W\u2019s\nimmediate family residing in Sudan have any political affiliations with the Sudan\ngovernment or military, have any history to date of being subjected to any coercion or\ninfluence, or appear to be vulnerable to the same. \nStill, upon fully considering Applicant\u2019s explanations about his siblings and family\nmembers residing in Sudan, and his wife\u2019s dual Sudan citizenship and deep family roots\nin Sudan (which include all of her siblings who still reside there), risks of undue foreign\ninfluence on Applicant, his own siblings, his wife and her family members residing in\nSudan and Egypt, respectively, Applicant/W\u2019s contacts with their family members  appear\nto be substantial and ongoing, and clearly of the magnitude that could make them subject\nto a heightened security risk of pressure or compromise under Guideline B.\nSudan, a country reported to be a continuous state of civil war with its ethnic\npopulations of Darfur, continues to be a very repressive state that is historically burdened\nwith a poor human rights record and respect for the rule of law.  Not only is Sudan a\nreported repressive state who has targeted ethnic people to the South for various human\nrights abuses, but it is known to be very dangerous to Americans and westerners\ntraveling outside the main cities of the country.\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se\nresults or mandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are\ncitizens/residents of foreign countries in general.  What is considered to be an acceptable\nrisk in one foreign country may not be in another.  While foreign influence cases must by\npractical necessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for\nreferencing in the supplied materials and country information about Sudan. \nUnlike the old Adjudicative Guidelines, the new ones do take into account the\ncountry\u2019s demonstrated relations with the U.S. as an important consideration in gauging\nwhether the particular relatives with citizenship and residency elsewhere create a\nheightened security risk. The geopolitical aims and policies of the particular foreign\nregime involved do matter.  As demonstrated, Sudan has long been known to be a\nrepressive country, who for decades has been involved in a ruthless civil war with the\nsouth/west.  Sudan remains a country on the State Department \u2018s state terrorist list, and\none with a known history of hostage taking and human rights abuses of wide magnitude\nand scope. \n\n11\nAs for security concerns associated with the presence of Applicant's extended\nfamily members in Sudan, the potential heightened risk of a hostage situation or undue\nforeign influence brought in the hopes of eliciting either classified information or economic\nor proprietary data out of Applicant through both his own family members and his wife\u2019s\nwife\u2019s siblings still residing in Sudan is considerable, Applicant\u2019s disclaimers\nnotwithstanding.  Based on his case-specific circumstances, MC 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the\npersons or activities of these persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.\u201d  is not available to Applicant.  Neither Applicant nor his wife and their respective\nfamily members residing in Sudan can be characterized as sufficiently insulated from\npotential pressures and influence from Sudan government and military officials to warrant\napplication of this mitigating condition.\nOf some benefit to Applicant is MC 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either\nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s demonstrated loyalty,\npatriotism, and professional commitments to the U.S., while considerable, are not enough\nto neutralize all potential conflicts that are implicit in his relationships with his spouse, his\nsiblings, and his wife\u2019s family membersr.  MC 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign\ncitizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create risk for\nforeign influence or exploitation,\u201d has some applicability, too, based on Applicant own\ninfrequent contacts with his wife\u2019s family members residing in Sudan.  Application of MC\n8(c) is necessarily limited, though, because of the frequent exchanges applicant and W\nmaintain with their family members residing in Sudan.\nTwo other mitigating conditions have mixed application to Applicant\u2019s situation.\nMC 8(e), \u201cthe individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements\nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, groups, or\norganizations from a foreign country,\u201d has some prospective value based on Applicant\u2019s\nassurances of reporting his travel plans to Sudan, and his long absence from the country\n(no visits since 1996).  But there is really no documented record of Applicant\u2019s prior\nreporting of his contacts with members of his family and his wife\u2019s family, respectively, to\nwarrant any more than minimal consideration at this time.  The same holds true with\nrespect to MC 8(f), \u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or\nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be\nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\u201d  The extent of\nApplicant\u2019s and W\u2019s financial interests and expectancies (e.g., inheritance) in Sudan is for\nthe most part still unknown.  \nWhole person assessment is not available either to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure\nto conflict of interests with his Sudan family members.  While Applicant is not aware of\n\n12\nany risks of coercion, pressure, or influence that any of his, or his wife\u2019s, family members\nmight be exposed to, he acknowledged little information about them, their backgrounds\nand relationships with former associates.  So, in Applicant\u2019s case, the potential risk of\ncoercion, pressure, or influence being brought to bear on him, his wife, or any of their\nrespective family members remains uncertain, and therefore potentially considerable. \nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's relations with his\nwife and their respective family members residing in Sudan, are insufficiently mitigated to\npermit safe predictive judgments about Applicant's ability to withstand risks of undue\ninfluence attributable to his familial relationships in the Sudan.  Unfavorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to the allegations covered by Guideline B.\nIn reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a\nwhole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E2.2.2 of the\nAdjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE B: (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a :\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n CONCLUSIONS\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. \nClearance is denied.\n                                  \nRoger C.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the eight allegations under the financial considerations guideline of the SOR. She also admitted the personal conduct allegation. She is 34 years old, married since 2002, with four children. She began employment with her current employer in May 2005 as a library assistant. As a result of a promotion, she is now an Administrative Assistant. She seeks a security clearance. Financial Considerations In 2001 and 2002, Applicant received $10,711.00 in unemployment compensation that she was not entitled to because she was working part-time. In 2002, a demand was made by State X (SOR 1e.) for repayment at $200.00 a month. Applicant declined the offer because she did not have the money. In an interview in October 2006, she stated her intention to reimburse State X, but she did not know when. Even though she worked 1 out a plan to repay State X in July 2007 (GE 4), she has made only two $100.00 payments for a total of $200.00.2 In addition to SOR 1.e., there are seven other accounts that became past due between 2002 and September 2005. The total amount of overdue debt is $20,985.00. In 3 October 2006, GE 6 contains entries that establish she paid the collection agency $132.00 to resolve SOR 1.h. In July 2007 (GE 4), she provided proof she paid $62.00 to satisfy the SOR 1.a. account, along with an account belonging to an unlisted creditor.

The action was taken pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued on or after September 1, 2006. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted her answer to the SOR on February 15, 2008. DOHA issued\na notice of hearing on April 2, 2008, and the hearing was held on April 30, 2008. At the\nhearing, six exhibits (GE 1 through 6) were admitted in evidence without objection to\nsupport the government\u2019s case. Applicant\u2019s five exhibits (AE A through AE E) were\nreceived in evidence without objection. She also testified. In the time allowed for\nJune 26, 2008\n\n Applicant\u2019s interview was taken in October 2006. (GE 5) At the hearing, Applicant claimed the demand was\n1\nnot made until 2006. (Tr. 51)\n (AE F). \n2\n As of December 31, 2007, the publication date of the SOR.\n3\n GE 1 reflects Applicant was unemployed from march 2003 to January 2004. \n4\n2\nApplicant to submit additional documentation, she submitted AE F (original and a copy)\ncontaining documentation of payments to the SOR 1.a. and 1.e. creditors. DOHA\nreceived the transcript on May 14, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the eight allegations under the financial considerations\nguideline of the SOR. She also admitted the personal conduct allegation. She is 34 years\nold, married since 2002, with four children. She began employment with her current\nemployer in May 2005 as a library assistant. As a result of a promotion, she is now an\nAdministrative Assistant. She seeks a security clearance. \nFinancial Considerations\nIn 2001 and 2002, Applicant received $10,711.00 in unemployment compensation\nthat she was not entitled to because she was working part-time. In 2002, a demand was\nmade by State X (SOR 1e.) for repayment at $200.00 a month. Applicant declined the\noffer because she did not have the money. In an interview in October 2006, she stated\nher intention to reimburse State X, but she did not know when.  Even though she worked\n1\nout a plan to repay State X in July 2007 (GE 4), she has made only two $100.00\npayments for a total of $200.00.2\nIn addition to SOR 1.e., there are seven other accounts that became past due\nbetween 2002 and September 2005. The total amount of overdue debt is $20,985.00.  In\n3\nOctober 2006, GE 6 contains entries that establish she paid the collection agency\n$132.00 to resolve SOR 1.h. In July 2007 (GE 4), she provided proof she paid $62.00 to\nsatisfy the SOR 1.a. account, along with an account belonging to an unlisted creditor. \nThe cable account (SOR 1b.) of $1,041.00 was opened in August 2003. Applicant\nindicated that she could not negotiate a settlement with the cable company because they\nbelieve she has two pieces of cable equipment in her possession. She claims she\nreturned the equipment to the cable company. \nApplicant opened the physical fitness account (SOR 1.c.) in October 2003.4\nAccording to GE 5, she stopped paying on the contract after two months. The creditor\nadvised her she breached the termination provisions of the contract. On February 19,\n2008, she entered in a settlement agreement with the creditor where she would pay\n$50.00 a month until the account was paid. Though the settlement letter is unsigned,\n\n AE F contains copies of the three checks referred to in AE B. \n5\n I am unable to give the same favorable weight to the handwritten notes as I do to the documents Applicant\n6\nprovided in support of her testimony that she made payments to SOR 1.c. and SOR 1.e. \n3\nApplicant provided proof the three payments referred to in the letter, were paid.  The\n5\n$50.00 payment is taken directly from her checking account every month. \nThe collection agency account pertains to a car she purchased in 2000 (SOR 1.d.)\nfor $3,500.00 to $4,500.00. When she could not make the payments, the car was\nrepossessed in October 2002. The deficiency balance on the car is $6,100.00. No action\nhas been taken on this account. \nSOR 1.e. is the unemployment compensation Applicant owes State X. She\nindicated that taking the money was a mistake, although she knew that taking the money\nwas wrong. The $100.00 repayments are taken directly from her checking account. \nIn GE 5, Applicant opened the utility account (SOR 1.f.) in September 2002. She\nforgot to pay the account when she moved. She disputed the amount owed. No action\nhas been taken on this account. \nThe account in SOR 1.g. belongs to a bank. Applicant made an order for deferred\npayment through her regular check card. When the deferred payment was due, Applicant\ndid not have sufficient funds in her checking account to cover the amount of the deferred\npayment. In AE F, Applicant submitted a one-page demand for payment from the SOR\n1.g. collection agency dated May 2003. Applicant wrote on the top of the document\n\u201cExhibit 1g [] $10 a month until pd\u201d At the bottom of the document, Applicant wrote the\naddress to send the payment, the contact person (unit manager), and the date. There is\nno documentation to show that a payment was actually made on the date referred to in\nthe document.  \n6\nThe telecommunications account in SOR 1.h. was settled by Applicant in October\n2006. Though the documentation does not appear in GE 5, GE 6, the credit bureau\nreport dated March 2008, reflects the past due debt was settled. \nApplicant provided budgets for March and April 2008 reflecting her earnings and\nexpenses. In March 2008, her net monthly remainder after expenses was a minus\n$355.00. In April 2008, her net monthly remainder after expenses was a minus $1004.00\nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant\u2019s receipt of unemployment compensation from State X while she was\nemployed part-time represents an intentional omission of relevant facts from an official\nform used by State X to evaluate how unemployment compensation is allocated.\nApplicant testified that her decision to take the money was partially due to the fact that\n\n (AE C).\n7\n (Id).\n8\n4\nother individuals were also involved in the same behavior. When she was receiving the\nunemployment compensation in 2001 and 2002, Applicant was 27 and 28 years old.\nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant provided information indicating that after expenses, she currently has no\ntake home pay.  She receives approximately $170.00 in food stamps to supplement her\n7\nincome. The take home pay in the first week of April 2008 for Applicant\u2019s husband was\nabout $26.00, and about $32.00 for the second week of April 2008.  In AE E, Applicant\n8\nprovided documentation from a debt management program she was ineligible for\nbecause she did not earn enough money. \nAs noted at the outset of this section, Applicant was promoted to Administrative\nAssistant. She provided no other character evidence concerning her job performance or\ncharacter away from the job. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\n\n5\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d \nThe record evidence indicates the Government has established its case under the\nfinancial considerations guideline. Applicant defrauded State X by failing to report her\npart-time income in 2001 and 2002. She has taken no documented action to satisfy the\ndebt until March 2008, more than five years after a demand was made by State X for her\nto return the money under a repayment plan. Since 2002, she opened seven additional\naccounts that have become delinquent. As of the date of the SOR, Applicant owed\n$20,985.00 to eight creditors. FC disqualifying condition (DC) 19.a. (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19.c. (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations) apply. Applicant\u2019s history of not meeting financial obligations began in 2001\nand 2002 when she was accepting unemployment compensation she was not entitled to.\nUntil recently, Applicant was unable to satisfy that debt, as well as most of her other\ndebts. \nThere are five mitigating conditions (MC) that are potentially applicable to the\ncircumstances. They are: FC MC 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); FC\nMC 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the\n\n6\nperson\u2019s control, and the individual acted reasonably under the circumstances); FC MC\n20.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are\nclear indications that the problem is resolved or under control); FC MC 20.d. (the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay creditors or otherwise resolve debts); and,\nFC MC 20.e. (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause or of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue). FC MC 20.a. does not apply. While the unlawful receipt of state funds occurred\nover five years ago, Applicant collected seven more recent delinquent debts. Though she\nhas incurred no new debt delinquencies after September 2005 (SOR 1.f.), she has\npresented insufficient evidence to show that her ongoing financial problems will not\npersist in the future.\nApplicant gains some benefit from FC 20.b. Although she did not supply much\ndetail for why she took the money, it is reasonable to conclude that unemployment or\nunderemployment were motivating factors. The mitigating condition allows for loss of\nemployment as an extenuating reason if the person acts responsibly following the loss of\nemployment and for a reasonable time thereafter. FC 20.b. also recognizes medical\nproblems can extenuate financial problems if the person acts reasonably during the\nmedical problem and for a reasonable period of time thereafter. Applicant\u2019s husband\nsuffered a back injury in 2005 that has prevented him from working in jobs that require\nheavy lifting. Between 2001 and September 2005, Applicant opened seven new\naccounts that fell into delinquency. Though Applicant\u2019s husband has difficulty finding\nemployment, Applicant has been continuously employed since May 2005. Aside from the\nSOR 1.a. and SOR 1.h. debts, Applicant did not take any action to resolve the other\ndebts until after she received the SOR. The limited mitigation Applicant receives under\nFC 20.b. is inadequate to overcome the adverse financial evidence.\nFC 20.c. does not apply as there is no evidence Applicant participated in financial\ncounseling or reorganized her financial obligations so that her indebtedness is under\ncontrol. The disparity between the monthly remainders in March and April 2008 provides\na substantial basis to conclude her financial problems are not under control.\nThe fact that Applicant paid two of the debts in 2006 and 2007 weighs in her favor\nunder FC MC 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts) Conversely, Applicant\u2019s action taken in repaying the other\ncreditors did not materialize until after she received the SOR. In sum, Applicant receives\nlittle mitigation under FC MC 20.d. \nFC MC 20.e. would apply to Applicant\u2019s dispute with the cable company.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s failure to provide proof of the dispute and actions taken to resolve\nthe dispute removes FC MC 20.e. from consideration. The extenuating reasons for her\nindebtedness are insufficient to find the financial guideline in her favor. Under the\ncircumstances, it remains to be seen whether Applicant will be successful in following\nthrough with the repayment of her remaining debt. \n\n7\nPersonal Conduct (PC)\nApplicant\u2019s failure to report her part-time employment while receiving\nunemployment compensation constitutes intentional conduct within the scope of PC DC\n16.a. (deliberate omission or falsification of relevant facts from a personnel security\nquestionnaire or similar form used to conduct investigations or award benefits or status)\nIn order to receive the unemployment compensation, she had to complete a form(s)\nrequiring her to report any kind of income. She knew that any income would reduce her\nunemployment compensation by the amount of money she earned. She did not report\nher part-time earnings, and is therefore obligated to reimburse State X. Applicant has not\nsatisfied her burden of persuasion under the personal conduct guideline. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nThe AG indicates the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and whole person concept. The WPC is made of nine general policy\nfactors:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nthe participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and, (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nAt the age of 27, Applicant dishonestly received unemployment compensation she\nwas not entitled to. In the period since 2002, she opened seven additional accounts that\nhave fallen delinquent in the amount of an additional $10,000.00. I have carefully\nconsidered her employment problems since 2002, along with her husband\u2019s medical\nproblems. However, she has had continuous employment since May 2005, and has been\npromoted. Though Applicant has made a start in trying repay her creditors, most of her\ndebt is still outstanding, and her monthly expenses exceed her earnings as indicated by\nher budget in April 2008. In sum, it is likely that Applicant\u2019s current financial difficulties\nwill continue. Her evidence does not overcome the negative evidence adduced under the\nFC and PC guidelines. \n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nFor Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",
