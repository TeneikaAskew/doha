Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On November 16, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On May 12, 2008,\nafter the hearing, Administrative Judge Charles D. Ablard denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s failure to find that\nApplicant\u2019s conduct is mitigated renders the Judge\u2019s decision arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to\nlaw.  \nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact in his decision:  Beginning in 1996,\nApplicant used illegal drugs and used prescription drugs illegally.  In 1998, Applicant was arrested\nfor driving under the influence and possession of a controlled substance.  He plead nolo contendere\nand was sentenced to perform community service and one year of probation.  Applicant completed\na pre-trial diversion program on the drug charge, and it was later  dismissed.  Applicant asserts that\nwhen he enlisted in the Army, his recruiter told him that he did not want to hear anything about prior\ndrug use from Applicant.  Other than his 1998 arrest and diversion, Applicant did not mention his\nhistory of illegal drug use on a security clearance application in 2001 or in his subsequent interview\nwith an investigator.  Applicant continued to use drugs while he was in the Army and in possession\nof a security clearance.  After he received a security clearance in September 2003, Applicant\u2019s use\nof illegal drugs included cocaine (at least twice) between June 2005 and March 2006.  Applicant\nwas discharged from the Army and last used illegal drugs at approximately the same time, in March\n2006.  When Applicant went to work for his current employer after his discharge, he was told that\nthe company did not tolerate illegal drug use during the period of employment and for two years\nprior to employment.  Applicant was forthright in revealing his history of drug abuse in completing\na security clearance application in 2007 and in a subsequent security interview.  \nThe Judge also found that Applicant had a distinguished military career.  He has received\nconsistently high evaluations and certificates of recognition from his current employer.  Applicant\nhas moved from the city where he used drugs and no longer associates with the persons he used\ndrugs with.  He is engaged and has purchased a home.  \nApplicant admitted to the allegations against him, and those admissions were sufficient to\nestablish the government\u2019s case against him.  The burden of proof then shifted to Applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the case against him.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Applicant attempted to\nexplain his falsification of his 2001 security clearance application.  He presented evidence regarding\nhis successful military career and a favorable job evaluation from his current employer.\nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s work record, the federal government need not wait until an\napplicant actually mishandles classified material before it can deny or revoke access to such material.\nAdams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  An\n\napplicant with good or exemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has negative security\nimplications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  In this case,\nApplicant admitted to using illegal drugs while in the Army, during a period when he held a security\nclearance. \n \n     \nApplicant argues that he presented enough evidence of rehabilitation that the Judge should\nhave granted him a clearance.  The Judge found some evidence of mitigation.  However, that alone\ndid not compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-23318 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2007).\nAfter reviewing the record as a whole, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the\nrelevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

On November 16, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines \nH (Drug Involvement), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal \nConduct) for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing and requested a hearing before an \nAdministrative Judge.

DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on January 14, 2008, for a hearing on January 30, 2008, and I convened the \nhearing as scheduled.  \n \nAt the hearing, the government offered four exhibits (Exh.) which were admitted in \nevidence without objection. Applicant submitted eight exhibits which were admitted \nwithout objection. He testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on February 7 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \nNotice \nThe hearing notice was dated 15 days before the hearing date. I advised Applicant \nof his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the hearing. Applicant \naffirmatively waived his right to the 15 days notice and indicated he was ready to proceed \n(Tr. 10).  \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations under \nGuidelines H (Drug Use), E (Personal Conduct), and J (Criminal Conduct).  \nApplicant is a thirty-year-old employee of a government contractor. He has worked  \nsince August 2006 in information systems, specializing in security issues involving the \nNISPOM and DSS investigations. He served on active duty in the Army between 2001 \nand 2006 and had a distinguished career. He was a distinguished honor graduate in \nadvanced individual training at Ft. Benning. He served overseas in Italy and Germany \nand in Kuwait during Operation Enduring Freedom when he extended his tour for one \nyear. He received a BS degree in information systems in 2005 while on active duty. He \nreceived numerous awards and citations during his military service (Exhs. B-E). He \nreceived an honorable discharge as a sergeant (E5) in March 2006. It was determined \nthat he had a military-related disability for which he receives compensation. He received \noutstanding evaluations while in the service (Exh. A).  \nSince his employment in the defense industry, Applicant has received consistently \nhigh evaluations from his company and certificates of recognition (Exhs. F - H). He has \nbeen accepted by a university in a Master\u2019s degree program in his field for which his \nemployer will pay the tuition costs.   \nApplicant is engaged to be married and has purchased a home. He no longer \nassociates with the friends he had during his period of drug use. He lives in a different \ncity from where he used drugs. He is from a military family. His father was enlisted in the \nMarines, and became an officer and a pilot. His father was his role model and inspired his \nmilitary career. Applicant has also become a pilot in the last two years. He is highly \nmotivated towards a successful career and a family. He has advised his family of his past \ndrug use.  \n\n \n3 \n                                      \nThe allegations in the SOR must be evaluated in the context of the above stated \ninformation relative to the career path of Applicant since many of the events covered in \nthe SOR occurred during the periods of successful performance in both the military and \nin his present position.  \n In 1998 when Applicant was 19 years of age he was arrested for DUI and \npossession of a controlled substance, Alprazolam (Xanax). He plead nolo contendere to \nthe first count and was sentenced to 112 hours of community service and probation for \none year. He entered a pre-trial diversion program for nine months for the drug charge \nand it was dismissed following completion of required counseling. He used ecstasy from \n1996 until June 2000. When he enlisted in 2001, his recruiter indicated to him that he did \nnot want to hear any information about prior drug use. The Army had a zero tolerance \npolicy on use of drugs while on active duty. After his enlistment he used valium and \nhashish until June 2003. He used marijuana with varying frequency from 1996 until 2000 \nand from April 2002 until February 2003. He used illegal drugs and prescription drugs \nillegally while serving the Army from 2002 until 2006. He used cocaine at least twice \nbetween June 2005 and March 2006. He received a security clearance on September 23, \n2003 while in the Army so he used the above described drugs while holding a security \nclearance until his discharge in March 2006.  \n When Applicant applied for a security clearance while in the Army in March 2001, \nhe did not acknowledge on his SF 86 any of the above drug uses except the 1998 arrest \nand pretrial diversion and he did the same in an statement to an investigator (Exhs. 2 and \n3). When he filed the 2007 SF 86 and in his answers to the 2007 interrogatory, he \nprovided fully the drug use information. When he was hired for his present position, the \ncompany made it clear that there should be no drug use and should not have been any \nfor the two previous years. He has not used drugs since March 2006. The evidence \noffered by the government in this case is based solely on information he provided to \nsecurity officials in 2007 (Exhs. 1 and 4).  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline H Drug Involvement \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Use is set out in AG & 24:  \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and \ninclude: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed \nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or \ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and \n \n \n \n(2) inhalants and other similar substances. \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n \n (b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction. \nThree drug involvement disqualifying conditions could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201cany drug abuse\u201d and \u201cillegal drug possession, \nincluding . . .  purchase, sale or distribution . . . .\u201d and \u201cany illegal drug use after being \ngranted a security clearance.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c) and 25(g). The other five disqualifying \nconditions listed in AG \u00b6 25 are not applicable. These three disqualifying conditions \napply because Applicant used drugs after applying for a security clearance. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides several conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n \n \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and \n  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation. \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nDrug involvement is partially mitigated by the passage of a period of over two \nyears since his most recent use of illegal drugs and he has apparently removed himself \nfrom contact with drug users.  However, the extensive period of the use of drugs and his \ndrug use while he was in the Army and holding a security clearance weighs against \nmitigating his drug involvement. Moreover, he did not enroll in or complete a drug \ntreatment or counseling program. I find that it is premature to conclude that the security \nconcern for drug use has been mitigated. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nGuideline E Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG & 15:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n AG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and, \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to report the post-1998 drug use on his 2001 SF 86, and to an \ninvestigator in 2002, prompted security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(b) and 16(c). \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f)   the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and, \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 17 apply. Applicant did not promptly \ninform the government of the falsification of his security clearance application. He \nfollowed this falsification in 2002 with a false statement concerning his drug \ninvolvement. He did not secure counseling designed to improve his conduct.  Although \nhis falsification of his security clearance application in 2001 was not recent, it is a \nserious offense. No one advised him to falsify his security clearance applications or to \nlie to an investigator. He admitted the false statements at issue, and the falsification \nallegations are all substantiated. His falsifications cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Security concerns pertaining to his personal \nconduct are not mitigated. \n \nWith respect to his illegal drug use while he was on active duty in the Army and \nwhile holding a security clearance, the pertinent disqualifying conditions are AG \u00b6 \n16(d)(3), a pattern of rule violations and AG \u00b6 16(e)(1), which states, \u201cpersonal conduct, \nor concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, \nmay affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d Certainly drug \nuse while in a sensitive position violates important military and civil rules in our society, \nand a lengthy history of drug use is conduct a person might wish to conceal as it \nadversely affects a person\u2019s professional and community standing. \n \nThe mitigating condition outlined in AG \u00b6 17(e) applies to his drug use while on \nactive duty and while holding a security clearance. Applicant has advised his family and \nsecurity officials of his past drug use. In 2007, he took the important, positive step of \ndisclosure, eliminating his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress. Thus, \nthere is no reason he would compromise national security to avoid public disclosure of \nhis drug problems. These personal conduct security concerns, pertaining to his drug \nuse while on active duty in the Army and while holding a security clearance, are \nmitigated.  \n \n \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nGuideline J Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG\u00b6 30, \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns for an \napplicant. Under AG \u00b6 31(a) commission of a serious crime is a disqualifying condition, \nand making a false statement in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious crime.  \nApplicant\u2019s false statement in his 2001 security clearance application and his 2002 \nstatement concerning his drug use both violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.   \n \nAG \u00b6 31(c) provides that \u201can allegation or admission of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted\u201d is a disqualifying condition. Applicant was arrested for DUI in 1998, and \npleaded nolo contendere.  After completion of his community service, counselling and \nprobation, the charge was dismissed. Nevertheless, there is sufficient evidence to \nconclude he committed the DUI, which is a criminal offense.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provide conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \n \nI conclude that the AG \u00b6 32(a) is applicable to his DUI in 1998.  He was 19 years \nold (SOR \u00b6 1.g) and it occurred before the maturing that occurred during his military \nservice.  He has not had a subsequent DUI.  His DUI offense is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on Applicant's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n  \n \nThe false statements in 2001 and 2002 are more serious and recent than the \nDUI.  Appellant\u2019s false statements are beyond the 5-year statute of limitations in Fed. R. \nCrim. P. 12(b)(2), which is applicable to offenses under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. See United \nStates v. Grenier, 513 F.3d 632, 635 (6th Cir. 2008). Furthermore, the same allegations \nabout false statements are replicated in Guideline E, which much more specifically \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                                             \naddresses Applicant\u2019s misconduct. The second mitigating factor raises the issue of \nrehabilitation. Applicant disclosed his drug use in 2007, and his disclosures were the \nonly evidence of his drug use. I conclude the criminal conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 3 is \nmitigated.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \n \nWhile Applicant has shown evidence of rehabilitation by changes in his life style, \nand actions to remove himself from contact with drugs and users of drugs, the period of \ntime elapsed since his last use of drugs has not been sufficient to warrant a whole \nperson finding in his favor. He failed to take advantage of the lessons he should have \nlearned after his arrest in 1998 when he went through counseling as a result of court \norder. The fact that he used drugs while in the Army and holding a security clearance \nraises questions about his judgment and rehabilitation that preclude the grant of a \nsecurity clearance at this time. It is laudable that he decided to come forth in 2007 and \nadmit his past conduct to his detriment in this matter. He believed it was the honorable \nthing to do and, it should serve him well in the long term.  \n \n \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, I conclude that Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from his drug use and personal conduct. It is \npremature to grant him a security clearance at this time.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.: Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f.:   Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h.:  Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i.:   Against Applicant  \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b.:  Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c.:  For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a.:  For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b.:  For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance at this time.

He deliberately falsified his 2006 security clearance application, when he \nfailed to disclose the majority of his criminal arrests, charges and convictions. Clearance \nis denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 12, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On June 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him (GE 9), pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \nOctober 3, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.1 The SOR alleges security \nconcerns under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR \ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under \nthe Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn July 25, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to \nhave his case decided by a hearing before an administrative judge (GE 10). On August \n19, 2008, Department Counsel stated she was ready to proceed and on August 19, \n2008, the case was assigned to me. On August 28, 2008, notice was issued for the \nhearing, which was held on September 18, 2008 (GE 8). At the hearing, Department \nCounsel offered seven exhibits (GEs 1-7) (Transcript (Tr.) 20), and Applicant offered \nnine exhibits (Tr. 21-26; AE A-I). There were no objections, and I admitted GEs 1-7 (Tr. \n20), and AEs A-I (Tr. 25-26). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, response to the SOR and \nHearing Notice (GEs 8-10). I received the transcript on September 25, 2008. At \nApplicant\u2019s request, I authorized until September 29, 2008, for him to submit \ndocumentation (Tr. 26, 45, 54). On September 29, 2008, I received AEs J-Q. \nDepartment Counsel did not object to my consideration of AEs J-Q (AE J), and I \nadmitted AEs J-Q. \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.bb, and he denied the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6 2 (GE 10; Tr. 15). His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make \nthe following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 45-years-old, and a high school graduate (Tr. 6). He has not \nattended college (Tr. 7). He currently holds an interim secret clearance (Tr. 7).  He is \nmarried. He has a two-year-old daughter and a 22-year-old stepson (Tr. 53).   \n  \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant has ten convictions involving concealment, larceny, theft, shoplifting or \ntrespassing, three of which are felonies.  He has two drug-related convictions, one is a \nfelony. He has seven convictions involving probation violations, contempt of court, and \ninterfering with a police officer, three of which are felonies.  His most recent arrests \n \n1On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. GEs 2 (Responses to Interrogatories) and 10 (Response to \nSOR) are the sources for the facts in this section unless stated otherwise.  \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nwere for assault and battery in July 2004, and for disorderly conduct in 2005. The \nassault and battery related to domestic violence (GE 2 at 5) and the disorderly conduct \nresulted from a disturbance at a Taco Bell restaurant (Tr. 28, GE 2 at 6). Applicant was \narrested for blowing his horn. The disorderly conduct was dismissed (Tr. 28). He has \nnot had any convictions since June 1996 (Tr. 27), and no arrests since the 2005 \ndisorderly conduct (Tr. 28).  He is not currently on probation or parole (Tr. 28-29). \n \n \nApplicant had a serious problem with heroin abuse from the early 1980s until \nabout 1995 (GE 2 at 6). By 1995, he was \u201csnorting\u201d two, $20 bags of heroin per day (GE \n2 at 6). He has purchased heroin almost every day when he was not in jail from about \n1985 to 1995 (GE 2 at 6). Since his release from jail in 1999, Applicant attends \nNarcotics Anonymous (NA) and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) approximately three times \na month (Tr. 29-30). He learned that he had to stop getting high because he was \nharming his family and himself (Tr. 30). He was at step one in NA and AA because he \nhad a difficult time fully admitting that he had a problem (Tr. 31). He receives support \nfrom AA and NA as well as from his family, including his siblings (Tr. 33). He avoids any \nassociation with those who abuse drugs (Tr. 34). Applicant attributed the criminal \noffenses from 1985 to April 1996 to heroin addiction (Tr. 32). He denied drug use after \n1996 (Tr. 32). His employer conducts random drug testing and he offered to submit to \nrandom drug testing (Tr. 33).   \n \n1985 to 1989 \n \nDuring the 1980s, Applicant was charged with ten criminal offenses. Ultimately, \nhe was convicted of five misdemeanors and one felony. The particular offenses, \ncharges and dispositions are as follows: \n \nIn September 1985, the court found Applicant guilty of Concealment/Alter Price, \na misdemeanor. The court sentenced him to 30 days in jail (30 days suspended), fined \nhim $25, and placed him on probation for one year. (SOR \u00b6 1.bb) \n \nIn January 1986, the court found Applicant guilty of Concealment, a \nmisdemeanor. The court sentenced him to 30 days in jail (28 days suspended), and \nfined him about $100 (SOR \u00b6 1.aa). \n \nIn July 1986, the police charged Applicant with (1) Robbery, a felony, and (2) Use \nof a Firearm in Commission of a Robbery, a felony. In August 1986, the court nolle \nprossed these charges (SOR \u00b6 1.z, GE 5 at 5). \n \nIn September 1986, the police charged Applicant with Possession of Controlled \nDrugs With Intent, a misdemeanor.

In August 2004, he received deferred adjudication. He successfully completed the \nprobation period and did not have a conviction (Tr. 38-39, GE 2 at 6).  \n \nWhen an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator interviewed him \non February 7, 2007, he admitted arrests and charges going back to the 1980s (GE 2). \nHe also provided details concerning his 2004 arrest and charges for assault and battery \nand 2005 disorderly conduct (GE 2 at 5-6). He described his attendance at domestic \nfamily class for ten weeks (GE 2 at 6). On May 19, 2005, Applicant completed all court-\nrequired probation and was released from probation (AE I). \n \nFalsification of Security Clearance Applications \n \nApplicant signed his SF 86 on May 18, 2006 (GE 1). He incorrectly responded, \n\u201cNo\u201d or did not provide complete information in his responses to questions pertaining to \nprevious criminal arrests, charges and convictions.  Section 23a, 23b and 23f of his SF \n86, (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, 2.c, respectively) asked: \n \nSection 23: Your Police Record \u2013 Felony Offenses for this item, report \ninformation regardless of whether the record in your case has been \n\u2018sealed\u2019 or otherwise stricken from the court record. The single exception \nto this requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled \nSubstances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under \nthe authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.  \n \na. Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense? \n(Include those under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.); and  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nb.

In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or \nconvicted of any offense(s) not listed in response to a, b, c, d, or e above? \n(Leave out traffic offenses of less than $150 unless the violation was \nalcohol or drug related.)    \n \nApplicant answered, \u201cYes\u201d to subsections 23a and 23d. He disclosed in February \n1994 he was convicted of felony heroin possession (GE 1). At his hearing he explained, \nhe could only remember that one offense when he was filling out his security clearance \napplication (Tr. 36-39). He thought he did not have to disclose the 2004, assault and \nbattery because it was in a type of deferred adjudication and subsequently dismissed \nafter he completed a domestic violence counseling program (Tr. 38-39). He did not \nsubsequently volunteer to investigators that he failed to disclose some of his past \ncriminal record on his security clearance application (Tr. 40-41).  \n \nRecommendations and Achievements \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s program manager indicates Applicant has worked for the contractor \nfor seven years.3 He describes Applicant as a valued employee. Applicant is a quick \nlearner, punctual, and highly motivated.  He has a positive attitude and is a team player. \n \n \nApplicant received a certificate of achievement in August 2008 (AE B), \ncertificates of completion for training and/or certification in October 2003 (AE O), July \n2004 (AE L), April 2005 (AE E), June 2005 (AE C), May 2006 (AE D), January 2007 (AE \nM), and May 2008 (AE K). He was entrusted to perform fire watch duties (AE F, G and \nH). He achieved qualification and technical expertise as shown by his training records \nand qualification sheets (AE N and P). \n \nApplicant met his spouse in 2002 (Tr. 53). His spouse went though the domestic \nviolence family program with him in 2004 (Tr. 52). She attested to his attendance at NA \nmeetings and noted that he speaks at some of the NA meetings (Tr. 53). Applicant had \nthe support of his family and his church (Tr. 52). He and his spouse received marital \ncounseling (Tr. 53). Applicant has been \u201cclean\u201d for more than 12 years and his spouse \nhas been clean for eight years (Tr. 53). Applicant has definitely changed and should \nreceive a security clearance (Tr. 54).  \n \n \nApplicant explained that after he was released from incarceration in 1999, he \nchanged (Tr. 42). He married and had a daughter (Tr. 42). He cares for and supports \nhis family (Tr. 42). He loves his family and his work (Tr. 44). He has not been disciplined \nat his job (Tr. 43). He has a good relationship with his associates at work and his \nsupervisors (Tr. 43). He paid his debt to society and abstains from drugs (Tr. 42).  He is \nloyal to the United States (Tr. 42).  \n \n3AE A, a letter dated September 17, 2008, is the source for the facts in this paragraph. \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d4 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5 \n \n \n4See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 \nF.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n5\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guidelines J (Criminal \nConduct) and E (Personal Conduct).  \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes six conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; \n \n(b) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces under dishonorable \nconditions;)  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; \n \n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation; \n \n(e) violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated \nrehabilitation program; and \n \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n(f) conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a \ncrime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and \nincarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than a year.6  \n \nAGs \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 31(c) and 31(e) apply. Applicant was convicted of several felonies \nand more than 10 misdemeanors. In June 1996, the police charged Applicant with \nViolation of Probation-2nd Offense, a \u201cfelony.\u201d The record indicates, in August 1996, the \ncourt found him \u201cguilty as charged,\u201d and sentenced him to four years of imprisonment. \nApplicant was incarcerated from February 28, 1997 until November 2, 1999 and then \nplaced on probation for two years (SOR \u00b6 1.e, GE 4 at 4). The pertinent state code \nreferences \u00a7 19.2-306 and describes a judgment of probation revocation issued by the \nsame court that issued the initial sentence to probation. It does not describe a trial on \nthe merits or a \u201cconviction.\u201d However, the original offense involved a conviction and an \n \n6 The SOR cited facts that would have brought Applicant\u2019s case under the prohibitions of the \nSmith Amendment (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986), because he was convicted and sentenced to and served more than \n12 months of confinement. However, this section of the United States Code, which applied only to \nclearances granted by the Department of Defense (DoD), was repealed on January 28, 2008, when the \nPresident signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 into law. It was replaced by \nadding Sec. 3002 to 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435b (the Bond Amendment), which applies throughout the Federal \nGovernment. Sec. 3002(c) of this new provision continues the requirement for disqualification, absent a \nmeritorious waiver, for persons who were sentenced to and served imprisonment for more than a year. \nHowever, this disqualification only applies to prevent clearances that would provide access to special \naccess programs (SAP), Restricted Data (RD), or any other information commonly referred to as \u201cspecial \ncompartmented information\u201d (SCI). \n \nThis statutory modification ends the former Smith Amendment requirement for a meritorious \nSecretarial waiver to grant or continue a regular, or \u201ccollateral,\u201d security clearance to a person who has \nserved more than a year on a criminal sentence. On June 20, 2008, the same day the SOR was issued in \nthis case, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) issued a memorandum providing interim \nguidance for implementation of the Bond Amendment. This memorandum set forth guidance for \nadjudicators to assess the potential application of the Bond Amendment to security clearance \ndeterminations and requirements for \u201cException\u201d identification of persons subject to its limitations in the \nJoint Adjudication Management System (JAMS) if a collateral clearance is granted. The granting of \naccess to SAP, RD or SCI to such individuals requires a meritorious waiver under the terms of that \nmemorandum. Such access is not at issue in this case, and accordingly the Bond Amendment was not \naddressed in either the SOR or at the hearing. \n \nThe repeal of the Smith Amendment also nullified the legal authority by which the Under \nSecretary of Defense for Intelligence modified the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) that were \napproved by the President on December 29, 2005. When the Under Secretary promulgated the AG for \nuse within DoD, on August 30, 2006, he added provisions reflecting the Smith Amendment. AG H (Drug \nInvolvement), AG I(Psychological Conditions), and AG J (Criminal Conduct) were each modified, but only \nthe latter guideline is involved in this case. It was modified by adding \u00b6\u00b6 31(f), 32(e),and footnotes 1 and \n2. Because the President, in Executive Order 12968, intended to establish \u201ca uniform Federal personnel \nsecurity program\u201d (Intro.), and required a \u201ccommon set of adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility \nfor access to classified information\u201d (Sec. 3.1(f).), the authority for these DoD modifications to the \nguidelines ended with the repeal of the Smith Amendment. The new statutory requirements are in effect \nand must be followed pending formal revision of the AG, but only the prohibition against granting \nclearances to unlawful drug users and addicts under AG H applies to \u201ccollateral\u201d security clearances. \nAccordingly, the Smith Amendment-related provisions added to AG J have been repealed, and do not \napply to the remaining proceedings in this case.     \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \noriginal sentence of more than one year of imprisonment. Ultimately he served 20 \nmonths of imprisonment. As indicated in n.6 infra, I have not found AG \u00b6 31(f) \napplicable as a disqualifying condition. \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply to mitigate the criminal conduct. Applicant's last \noffense resulting in a conviction occurred in June 1996, more than 12 years ago.  He \nhas changed his lifestyle and his environment. He has attended NA meetings for 10 \nyears and continues to receive NA counseling. He completed his probation. His NA \nattendance reinforces his rehabilitation. The source of his criminal problem was a \ndecade of heroin abuse. He stopped using heroin when he was incarcerated in 1996. \nHe has 12 years of heroin abstinence. He has demonstrated his intent not to abuse any \ndrugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) an \nappropriate period of abstinence. His criminal offenses are unlikely to recur. His \ndemonstrated intent is encompassed in these two mitigating conditions. He has \ndemonstrated remorse and been reformed with respect to his heroin-related criminal \nactivity. He received job training and has a good employment record.  There is a strong \nevidentiary record in this case showing his full rehabilitation for the particular offenses \nresulting in arrests, charges or convictions. Any doubt about his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment arises from his lack of candor, discussed below, and \nnot from his past criminal conduct.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and, \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nApplicant disclosed only one of his criminal offenses\u2014his 1994 arrest and \nconviction for possession of heroin. He did not disclose his other felonies (SOR \u00b6 2.a). \nHe did not disclose his July 1986, charges of (1) Robbery, a felony, and (2) Use of a \nFirearm in Commission of a Robbery, a felony (SOR \u00b6 2.b).  He did not disclose his \n2001 and 2004 arrests for assault and battery (SOR \u00b6 2.c). AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) both \napply.7 \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n7Deliberate and materially false answers on a security clearance application may violate 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1001. The Supreme Court defined \u201cmateriality\u201d in United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 512 \n(1995): as a statement having a \u201cnatural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing, the decision \nmaking body to which it is addressed.\u201d See also United States v. McLaughlin, 386 F.3d 547, 553 (3d Cir. \n2004). If Applicant had provided accurate answers on his security clearance applications, his accurate \nanswers are capable of influencing the government to deny his security clearance. His criminal offenses \nare sufficiently serious to potentially jeopardize approval of his security clearance. Making a false \nstatement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious crime, a felony (the maximum potential sentence includes \nconfinement for five years and a $10,000 fine). In light of my ultimate decision, and the absence to \nalleged a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 in the SOR, it is unnecessary for me to decide whether or not \nApplicant actually violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations.  \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. He does receive some credit for \ntruthfully describing his criminal offenses and background to an OMP investigator.  At \nhis hearing, he admitted preparing his 2006 security clearance application and \nanswering incorrectly. However, he was not honest and candid at his hearing about his \nstate of mind when he completed his security clearance application. He said he was \nconfused about the requirement to disclose arrests when the charges were ultimately \ndismissed. He also said he could only remember one felony.8 His statement at his \nhearing about his reasons for not disclosing the police information is not credible. He \nwas well aware of more than one reportable felony, and knowingly and deliberately \nchose not to disclose full information about those felonies on his security clearance \napplication.     \n \n8The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)).  \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \nThe comments in the Analysis section of this decision are incorporated in the \nWhole Person Concept. Applicant committed numerous offenses from 1985 to 1996. \nHowever, the evidence of the offenses after 1996 is not compelling, as he was not \nconvicted and the offenses are less serious. His lengthy criminal record is connected to \nhis addiction to heroin. Applicant receives substantial credit for his ten years of NA \nattendance, his devotion to his family, and his other efforts to reform and rehabilitate \nhimself after 1996. His work for a defense contractor is excellent, and aside from the \nSOR allegations no other disciplinary or security-related problems surfaced. His record \nof good employment weighs in his favor. There is some compelling evidence of his \nresponsibility, rehabilitation, mitigation. I am convinced that he is loyal to his family, his \ncompany, his church and his country.   \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate failure to disclose information on his security clearance \napplication is serious, recent and not mitigated. At his hearing on September 18, 2008, \nhe was not candid about why he failed to provide full and complete information on his \nsecurity clearance application. He said he could only remember one felony, and I do not \nbelieve this to be a truthful, candid explanation for failing to list more of his criminal \nhistory. I have questions about his current ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all \nthe facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has \nmitigated security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct, but has not mitigated such \nconcerns about his personal conduct.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d and \n\n \n15 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas failed to mitigate or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.bb: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 13, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct), Guideline M (Use of Information Technology Systems), and Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive).  Department Counsel requested a hearing.  On March 10, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Rita C. O\u2019Brien denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to give sufficient\nweight to his evidence of mitigation; whether the Judge erred in mischaracterizing Applicant\u2019s\nviewing of pornography in 2008 as child pornography rather than adult pornography; and whether\nthat characterization influenced the Judge\u2019s reasoning and prevented her from reaching a fair and\nimpartial decision.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is 38 years old and has\nheld a security clearance since 1990.  When Applicant was 14, he inappropriately touched a 6-year-\nold girl he was babysitting.  He was not prosecuted.  Thereafter, while babysitting, Applicant had\ninappropriate sexual thoughts while changing the diaper of a 6-month-old girl, but did not act on\nthem.  Applicant viewed pornographic videotapes while in college.  At the same time, Applicant\ndiscovered child pornography, which gave him \u201cmore of a high.\u201d  The child pornography Applicant\naccessed twice during college was textual rather than pictorial.  Between 1998 and 2004, Applicant\nused his work computer to view child pornography approximately twelve times.  Between 1996 and\n2005, Applicant used his work computer to view adult pornography approximately twice per month.\nApplicant knew that viewing child pornography was illegal.  While he was not aware of the exact\nlanguage of his employer\u2019s policy on personal use of company computers to view pornography, he\nwas aware that such use was \u201cnot in accord with how [company] wishes to do business.\u201d  Decision\nat 3, citing transcript at 67-69.  Applicant viewed pornography at work in an area where someone\nmight discover that he was doing it, and he \u201cenjoyed the thrill of engaging in forbidden behavior.\u201d\nDecision at 3.  \nApplicant underwent a polygraph examination at a government agency in January 2005.\nApplicant stated that the examination forced him to confront his pornography habit.  A few days\nlater, Applicant purchased content-monitoring software that blocks access to pornography sites and\ninstalled it on his work computer.  He purchased a later version in 2008 because the earlier version\ninterfered with his work.  Applicant can disable or remove the software at any time.  In 2008,\napproximately six months before the hearing, Applicant disabled the software and accessed adult\npornography at work.  \nAfter the polygraph examination, Applicant told his wife about his viewing of pornography.\nIn 2006 and 2007, Applicant met with his pastor for counseling.  Only Applicant\u2019s wife and pastor\nare aware of his habit.  Others know that his access to classified materials was limited after the\npolygraph examination, but they do not know why.  Applicant admitted all the allegations in the\nSOR except for a portion of one allegation under Guideline D.\nIn his appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge did not give adequate weight to his mitigating\nevidence.  The Judge referred to Applicant\u2019s testimony and discussed the possible application of\nmitigating conditions in Applicant\u2019s case.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone\ncompel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has\nto weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (May 23, 2008).  With one\n\nApplicant admits viewing child and adult pornography on his work computer over a period of time.   Applicant\n1\ndistinguishes between child pornography and adult pornography in part because the viewing of child pornography\nviolates federal law, while the viewing of adult pornography does not.  However, for at least part of the time, Applicant\nwas aware that the viewing of any pornography on his work computer was a violation of his employer\u2019s policy.   \nexception to be discussed below, the record in this case supports the Judge\u2019s conclusions.\nApplicant identifies an error by the Judge.  When discussing her conclusions under Guideline\nJ, the Judge incorrectly stated that Applicant had viewed child pornography at work six months\nbefore the hearing, when in fact Applicant testified that he had viewed adult pornography at that\ntime.  Elsewhere in her decision, the Judge identified the pornography viewed at that time as adult\npornography.  The error by itself is harmless.  The Judge was unlikely to reach a different decision\nin the absence of that error, since Applicant admitted to allegations under four guidelines and the\nJudge found against Applicant under all four.1\nApplicant contends that the Judge considered all pornography, not just child pornography,\nto be illegal and therefore was unable to reach an impartial decision in his case.  This is analogous\nto a claim of bias.  There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased.  A party\nseeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n02-08032 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004).  The Board has noted that the issue is not whether Applicant\nbelieves the Judge was biased or prejudiced against Applicant.  Rather the issue is whether the record\ncontains any indication that the Judge acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to\nquestion the fairness or impartiality of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-02253 at 3 (App. Bd.\nMar. 28, 2008).  In this case after a review of the Judge\u2019s decision and the entirety of the record, the\nBoard concludes that Applicant has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating bias on the part of\nthe Judge.   \nAfter reviewing the record as a whole, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the\nrelevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Between 1996 and 2005, Applicant used his work computer to view adult pornography approximately twice per month. Applicant knew that viewing child pornography was illegal. While he was not aware of the exact language of his employer\u2019s policy on personal use of company computers to view pornography, he was aware that such use was \u201cnot in accord with how [company] wishes to do business.\u201d Decision at 3, citing transcript at 67-69. Applicant viewed pornography at work in an area where someone might discover that he was doing it, and he \u201cenjoyed the thrill of engaging in forbidden behavior.\u201d Decision at 3. Applicant underwent a polygraph examination at a government agency in January 2005. Applicant stated that the examination forced him to confront his pornography habit. A few days later, Applicant purchased content-monitoring software that blocks access to pornography sites and installed it on his work computer. He purchased a later version in 2008 because the earlier version interfered with his work. Applicant can disable or remove the software at any time. In 2008, approximately six months before the hearing, Applicant disabled the software and accessed adult pornography at work. After the polygraph examination, Applicant told his wife about his viewing of pornography. In 2006 and 2007, Applicant met with his pastor for counseling. Only Applicant\u2019s wife and pastor are aware of his habit. Others know that his access to classified materials was limited after the polygraph examination, but they do not know why. Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR except for a portion of one allegation under Guideline D. In his appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge did not give adequate weight to his mitigating evidence. The Judge referred to Applicant\u2019s testimony and discussed the possible application of mitigating conditions in Applicant\u2019s case. The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision. As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not suffici",

After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant, 38 years old, attended college from 1988 to 1992, and earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Aerospace Engineering. He is married and the father of a 10-year-old son and two daughters aged eight and five. Applicant has worked for the same defense contractor since 1993. He has held a security clearance with access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) since 1990 (GE 1; Tr 6). 3 In 1984, when Applicant was 14 years old, he inappropriately touched and fondled a 6-year-old girl he was babysitting. He was not prosecuted. A few months later, while babysitting, he changed the diaper of a 6-month old infant girl and had inappropriate sexual thoughts, but did not act on them (GE 3). While in college, Applicant viewed pornographic video tapes (Tr 64). His frequent viewing of pornography led him to discover child pornography (Tr 37; 41), which gave him \u201cmore of a high\u201d (GE 3). Between1990 and 1992, he twice accessed sites that featured textual, non-pictorial stories involving minors engaged in sexual acts (GE 3; AE B). During the period 1998 through 2004, while employed at a defense contractor, he used his work computer to view child pornography sites that involved 12 to 15 year old",

Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is denied.\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), which he signed on February 8, 2007. After reviewing the results of the ensuing\nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent\n1\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. \nMarch 10, 2009\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. The\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply\nto all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after September 1,\n2006.\nSee DoD Directive 5220.6, \u00b6 E3.1.7.\n \n3\nThe inaccuracy to which Applicant objected will be considered in conjunction with AE B, in which Applicant\n \n4\nprovides his correction to the inaccuracy.\n2\nOn August 13, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), that\nspecified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive under\nGuidelines D (Sexual Behavior), M (Use of Information Technology Systems), J (Criminal\nConduct), and E (Personal Conduct) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2\nApplicant received the SOR on August 19, 2008. He signed his notarized Answer on\nAugust 28, 2008, in which he admitted all allegations in the Statement of Reasons except\none element of allegation 1.d. He also requested an administrative decision based on the\nrecord; however, on September 25, 2008, the government requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 13,\n3\n2008, and the case was assigned to me on November 17, 2008. DOHA issued a Notice of\nHearing on November 19, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on December\n11, 2008.\nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered 5 exhibits. Government Exhibits\n(GE) 1, 2, 4, and 5 were admitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s objection to GE 3, based\non inaccuracy, was overruled, and GE 3 was admitted.  Applicant offered three exhibits,\n4\nwhich were admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C. DOHA\nreceived the transcript (Tr) on December 23, 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations, as well as those in response to the\nDOHA interrogatories (GE 2), are admitted as fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings,\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the record evidence, I make the following additional\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant, 38 years old, attended college from 1988 to 1992, and earned a\nBachelor\u2019s degree in Aerospace Engineering. He is married and the father of a 10-year-old\nson and two daughters aged eight and five. Applicant has worked for the same defense\ncontractor since 1993. He has held a security clearance with access to Sensitive\nCompartmented Information (SCI) since 1990 (GE 1; Tr 6).\n\n3\nIn 1984, when Applicant was 14 years old, he inappropriately touched and fondled\na 6-year-old girl he was babysitting. He was not prosecuted. A few months later, while\nbabysitting, he changed the diaper of a 6-month old infant girl and had inappropriate sexual\nthoughts, but did not act on them (GE 3). While in college, Applicant viewed pornographic\nvideo tapes (Tr 64). His frequent viewing of pornography led him to discover child\npornography (Tr 37; 41), which gave him \u201cmore of a high\u201d (GE 3). Between1990 and 1992,\nhe twice accessed sites that featured textual, non-pictorial stories involving minors engaged\nin sexual acts (GE 3; AE B). During the period 1998 through 2004, while employed at a\ndefense contractor, he used his work computer to view child pornography sites that involved\n12 to 15 year old girls. He accessed such sites approximately 12 times. Between 1996 and\n2005, he used his work computer to view adult pornography approximately twice per month\n(GE 3; AE B). Applicant watched child and adult pornography on his employer\u2019s computer\nin an area where \u201cyou just hoped nobody looked over your shoulder and saw that you were\ndoing it.\u201d (Tr 68). \nApplicant did not use his home computer to access any type of pornography (Tr 75)\nand his wife had no knowledge of his involvement with pornography (Tr 55-56). Nor did his\nsupervisor, coworkers, or friends know of his habit. He did talk with his pastor in 1997, but\ndid not seek further counseling at that time (GE 3). \nThe Computer Ethics policy of Applicant\u2019s employer prohibits use of company\ncomputers to view inappropriate materials and requires that computer use conform with the\nlaw (GE 5, effective April 1, 2006). Applicant could not say at what point in time he became\naware of his company\u2019s policy on pornography. However, he acknowledges that when he\nviewed pornography he knew it was \u201cnot in accord with how [company] wishes to do\nbusiness.\u201d (Tr 67-69). He also knew, when he accessed child pornography, that it was illegal\n(Tr 54).\nApplicant accessed child pornography sites because he enjoyed the thrill of engaging\nin forbidden behavior (GE 3):\nAs I stated to the investigator, my access to child pornography did not stem\nfrom sexual desire, but from rather a sense of looking at something or\naccessing something taboo that I shouldn\u2019t be accessing. The fact in doing\nso did not bring an immediate consequence to myself only helped to fuel the\nidea that I was getting away with something. (Tr 34).\nIn January 2005, a government agency administered a polygraph to Applicant, during\nwhich he disclosed his history of involvement with pornography. He stated that he believed\nhe had a problem with pornography, and that \u201cIf I was locked in a room with a computer that\nhad unrestricted access to the internet, I would eventually end up at a child porn site.\u201d (GE\n3).The questions posed by the polygrapher awakened him to the gravity of his conduct: \nAnd it was through his questioning that I was forced to confront exactly what\nit is that I was doing, what is said about me as a person, a husband and a\nfather.\n\n Directive, 6.3\n5\n4\nWhatever image I had of myself was broken apart, and what was left grieved\nand disgusted me. (Tr 34-35). \nThe government agency denied Applicant\u2019s access to SCI (GE 3). After the polygraph,\nApplicant confessed his involvement with pornography to his wife. A few days later, he\npurchased content-monitoring software that blocks access to pornography sites (AE A) and\ninstalled it on his work computer. In 2008, he purchased a later version because the original\nversion interfered with his ability to run other software required by his job. Applicant can\ndisable or remove the content-monitoring software at any time (Tr 81-82). In 2008,\napproximately six months before the hearing, Applicant disabled the software and again\naccessed  adult pornography on his work computer (Tr 80-81).\nIn late 2006, Applicant began a series of sessions with the pastor of his church for\ncounseling about his habit. They met for three to four months. During the summer of 2007,\nthey talked informally. In 2008, he met with the pastor four times \u2013 in April, June, October\nand the day before the hearing in December (Tr 75-78). His pastor is aware that Applicant\nhas viewed child pornography, but their focus has been on adult pornography (Tr  78). \nCurrently, only Applicant\u2019s wife and pastor know about his history of viewing child and\nadult pornography. His manager, coworkers and friends  remain unaware of the underlying\nreason that his SCI access was denied after his polygraph (Tr 70-72). During the present\ninvestigation, Applicant informed the investigator that \u201cthe issue is no longer a problem\u201d for\nhim (GE 3). He also stated that \u201cit is not something he was proud of and does not wish to tell\nmany people.\u201d (GE 3). Applicant has no intent to view either child or adult pornography in the\nfuture (Tr 80). \nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, and\nconsideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG).  Specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\n5\nmeasured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of\naccess to classified information. \nHowever, the Guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. The presence or absence of\na disqualifying or mitigating condition under a Guideline does not determine a conclusion for\nor against an Applicant. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nGuidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors listed\nin \u00b62(a) of the Guidelines. \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the question of whether it is\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n See Executive Order 10865 \u00a77.\n7\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n8\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n9\n5\nclearly consistent with the national interest  for an Applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d  Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a determination\n7\nas to the loyalty of the Applicant; it is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.\nThe government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which\nit based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an Applicant.\nAdditionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nIf the government meets its burden, it then falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or\nmitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified\n8\ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and\nconfidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant\npossesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness to protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard\ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.  \n9\nAnalysis\nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior\nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern under Guideline D:\nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality\nor emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or\nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference\nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the\nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\nAG \u00b6 13 includes the following relevant conditions that raise security concerns\n\n 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252 (GE 4 shows the versions in effect in 1992 and from 1996 to 2004). Applicant\u2019s actions\n10\nfrom 1990 to 1992 do not appear to have violated the statute, as he accessed textual stories rather than the\nprohibited visual depictions. \n6\nand may be disqualifying:\n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the  individual has\nbeen prosecuted;\n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to  coercion,\nexploitation, or duress\n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of  discretion\nor judgment.\nAll three disqualifying conditions apply. Although Applicant was never prosecuted,\nhis viewing of child pornography violated federal law (AG \u00b6 13(a)).  Between 1998 and\n10\n2004, he accessed child pornography web sites 12 times, and he did so on a computer\nat his job, in a location that was sufficiently public that where other employees or his\nsupervisor could have discovered him (AG \u00b6 13(d)). Finally, Applicant disclosed his\nconduct only to his wife and his pastor. His supervisor, friends, and coworkers are\nunaware of his history of viewing adult and child pornography. The fact that he is not\nproud of his actions, and does not want others to know, indicates that he is vulnerable to\nexploitation (AG \u00b6 13(c)).\nGuideline D also contains conditions to mitigate security concerns. AG \u00b614\nprovides the following relevant conditions:\n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no\nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature;\n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under\nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, \n           Although Applicant started viewing pornography in college, his behavior did not end\nin when he graduated. It continued during the years he worked, married and became a\nfather. His most recent use of pornography occurred in approximately June 2008, when\nhe was 38 years old. Applicant viewed pornography frequently \u2013 twice per month over a\nnine-year period \u2013 violating the law and company policy. His behavior casts serious doubt\non his trustworthiness and neither AG 14 \u00b6 (a) nor AG 14 \u00b6 (b) apply. As Applicant\u2019s\nconduct is unknown to all but two people, and he does not wish it to be known, it remains\n\n7\na basis for coercion, and AG 14 \u00b6 (c) cannot be applied. I find against Applicant on\nGuideline D.\nGuideline M, Misuse of Information Technology Systems\nAG \u00b6 39 expresses the security concern pertaining to use of information\ntechnology systems:\nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining\nto information technology systems may raise security concerns about an\nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the\nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and\ninformation. Information Technology Systems include all related computer\nhardware, software, firmware, and data used for the communication,\ntransmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or protection of\ninformation.\nAlthough the disqualifying conditions do not specifically describe this situation, the\nfacts do fall under the Concern raised by this Guideline. Applicant\u2019s conduct in using his\nwork computer to access adult and child pornography was not in compliance with his\nemployer\u2019s policy regarding the use of company computers. He viewed pornography in\n2008, violating the policy in effect as of April 2006 (GE 5). His knowing violation of policy\nshows that he is willing to ignore rules to satisfy his own desires.\nAG \u00b6 41 provides two relevant mitigating conditions:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a\nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of\nsupervisor\nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 41(a) does not apply, as discussed previously, because\nApplicant\u2019s actions were frequent, recent, and untrustworthy. Moreover, AG \u00b6 41(c) cannot\nbe applied. Applicant\u2019s conduct was the opposite of inadvertent: he did it, in part, because\nhe knew it was forbidden, and he enjoyed breaking the rules. This is most disturbing in\none who seeks access to classified information. Applicants for security clearances enter\ninto a relationship of trust with the government, one where they agree to follow rules, not\nto thwart them. I find against Applicant on Guideline M.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern about personal conduct:\n\n8\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe facts support application of two disqualifying conditions: AG \u00b6 16(d):\n \ncredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination,\nbut which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited to\nconsideration of:\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client\nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of\nsensitive corporate or other government protected information;\n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the workplace; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and,\n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time\nor resources.\nand AG 16(e): \npersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, that\ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1)\nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal,\nprofessional, or community standing, or (2) while in another country,\nengaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is legal in that\ncountry but illegal in the United States and may serve as a basis for\nexploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence service or\nother group;\nApplicant\u2019s behavior demonstrates a long-standing willingness to disregard rules\nand regulations. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct in viewing child pornography between 1998\nand 2004, indicates his willingness to place his own needs above the law. His viewing of\nadult pornography twice per month between 1996 and 2005, and his viewing of adult\npornography only months ago, show his willingness, and even desire, to disregard his\ncompany\u2019s rules. The fact that he engaged in these activities while he held a security\n\n Applicant notes that his accessing of textual child pornography in 1990 - 1992 did not violate the statute,\n11\nwhich applies to \u201cvisual depictions.\u201d However, his conduct in 1996 - 2004, when he accessed web sites\ncontaining visual images, did violate the statute.\n9\nclearance underscores his willingness to disregard the trust that the government had\nplaced in him. A pattern emerges from these facts that demonstrates untrustworthiness.\nAG \u00b6 16(d)(1) applies. Moreover, disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(e) applies because\nApplicant\u2019s activities are unknown to his friends, coworkers and supervisor. His wish that\nthey remain secret indicates that their disclosure would, in his eyes, affect his standing,\nand places him in a position of vulnerability to coercion.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct under Guideline E is unmitigated by AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is\nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). As discussed under Guidelines\nD and M, his conduct is frequent and recent. It also reflects negatively on his\ntrustworthiness: he betrayed the trust of his wife and his employer not only by viewing\npornography, but by concealing his actions over many years. I find against Applicant on\nGuideline E.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe facts raise two disqualifying conditions: AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses); and AG \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted).\nApplicant admits that he accessed child pornography on his employer\u2019s computer, that he\ndid it numerous times, and that he knew it was illegal.  AG \u00b6 31(a) and (c) apply.\n11\nTwo mitigating conditions are relevant: AG \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since\nthe criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment) and AG \u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including\nbut not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement). \nNeither AG \u00b6 32(a) nor AG \u00b6 32(d) mitigate Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant \naccessed child pornography approximately six months before the hearing, which is recent.\nHis illegal conduct did not occur under unusual circumstances; on the contrary, Applicant\n\n10\nviewed child pornography while at work. As he will be working for many years into the\nfuture, the opportunity to access child pornography will present itself over and over, each\nday that he sits down at his computer. Even though he installed content-filtering software,\nApplicant can and has overridden it, so it does not prevent his illegal conduct. Applicant\u2019s\ndesire to \u201cget away with something\u201d indicates a lack of trustworthiness and good judgment,\nwhich, when coupled with the recurring opportunity to access child pornography,\nundermines any claim to mitigation under AG \u00b6 32(a).\nAs to AG \u00b6 32(d), Applicant\u2019s realization of the gravity of his wrongdoing, as well\nas his confession to his wife, and his pastoral counseling, demonstrate some\nrehabilitation. However, three to four months of meetings in 2006-2007, and four times in\n2008, appear insufficient when compared to his many years of viewing pornography. He\nhas not sought professional counseling or therapy or even investigated whether or not it\nis appropriate in his case. The fact that, despite the counseling, he again viewed\npornography only six months ago undermines a claim of rehabilitation. AG \u00b6 32(d) cannot\nbe applied. I find against Applicant on Guideline J.\nWhole Person Analysis  \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the\nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and all\nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8)\nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I considered the\npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances\nsurrounding this case. \nAlthough Applicant started viewing pornography in college, his conduct cannot be\nmitigated based on immaturity, because he has continued to access it, most recently at\nthe age of 38. Each time he knowingly accessed a pornographic site at work, he placed\nhis own desires above company policy. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s viewing of child\npornography over many years constitutes a repeated violation of federal law. Each time\nhe knowingly accessed a child pornography site, he placed his own desires above the law.\n\n11\nApplicant\u2019s questioning by the polygrapher in 2005 awakened Applicant to the\ngravity of his behavior. It is commendable that he confessed to his wife, that he installed\nsoftware to bar him from entering pornography sites, and that he sought counseling from\nhis pastor. However, on balance, these actions cannot outweigh his behavior. Applicant\nresolved to change after his January 2005 polygraph, yet he did not seek counseling until\n2006, almost two years later. The software that he installed to block pornography can be\ndisabled at any time, and so it failed to prevent him from viewing pornography again in\n2008. The fact that Applicant has continued to engage in behavior that could destroy his\nlivelihood, and that he viewed pornography again so recently, despite his counseling, his\nsoftware, his intentions and his self-awareness, raises the question of whether or not he\nwill be able to refrain from such behavior in the future.\nOverall, the record evidence fails to satisfy the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s\nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1, Guideline D\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a. - 1.f.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline M\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 4, Guideline J\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 4.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to\nclassified information.

On November 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nC and B for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on November 29, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on January 31, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nFebruary 7, 2008, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on March 5, 2008, in\nSan Diego, California. \n\n2\nThe Government offered Exhibits (Ex) 1 and 2, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He also submitted Exhibits A and B,\nwhich were admitted. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until March\n12, 2008, to submit additional documents.  On March 11, 2008, he submitted three\ndocuments, which have been marked as Exhibits C through E, and entered into\nevidence without objection, and the record closed on that date. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr) on March 14, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nOn January 24, 2008, Department Counsel filed a Motion to Amend the\nStatement of Reasons, which was served on Applicant on that date. The proposed\namended SOR added two additional allegations to the SOR. At the hearing, Applicant\nindicted that he had no objection to the amendments to the SOR.  In his RSOR,\nApplicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a. through 1.c., although he denied that this\nindicated a preference for a foreign country. At the hearing, he admitted new allegations\n1.d. and 1.e. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, the testimony of Applicant, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 48 years old and was born in the United States. Applicant is married\nto a United States citizen, and he has one son. \nApplicant is consultant for a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\n(Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \n1.a. It is alleged in the SOR that as of September 17, 2007, Applicant possessed\na passport from the Netherlands (Dutch passport), which was issued on February 7,\n2007, and is not scheduled to expire until February 17, 2012. At the hearing Applicant\nadmitted that he still possessed a Dutch passport.\nSubsequent to the hearing, Applicant submitted a letter from the Director of\nSecurity of his employer, who stated that on March 11, 2008, she personally destroyed\nApplicant\u2019s Dutch passport. She also confirmed that she has retained the remains of the\ndestroyed passport in her security file (Ex C).  \n1.b. Applicant applied for and was issued a Dutch passport on February 7, 2007,\neven though he is a United States citizen by birth. Applicant first received his Dutch\npassport in 1981. He was able to do this since his father was born in Netherlands. At\nthe time he applied, he was living in England, while working for an American company.\nApplicant has never used this current passport or the one he received before that. In\n\n3\n1981 he first received a passport from Netherlands, which he used while traveling\nthroughout Europe. \n1.c. Applicant applied for and was granted citizenship from Netherlands  in 1981,\nduring the period that he was living and working in England from 1981 to 1994.\nApplicant indicated at the hearing that he was not willing to renounce his Dutch\ncitizenship, as he would like to maintain the option of one day in the future moving back\nto Europe.  \n1.d. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant exercised dual citizenship with\nNetherlands and the United States, because of allegations 1.a., through 1.c., listed\nabove. Applicant contends that he has not engaged in any of the responsibilities or\nduties of being a Dutch citizen, as he has never lived in Netherlands, nor voted in a\nDutch election. He also owns no property in Netherlands or any other country outside of\nthe United States. \n1.e. Applicant maintains a British retirement account that was opened during the\nperiod that he worked in England. The account now has a value of close to $20,000.\nApplicant testified that he does not have access to this account until he turns 64, but the\naccount is of little consequence to him. \nHe submitted a statement, dated December 31, 2007, showing his retirement\naccount in the United States to have a net worth of approximately $153,000 (Ex D). He\nalso testified that he has a savings account in the United States worth approximately\n$35,000. Finally, he estimates his consulting business to be worth between $10,000 and\n$15,000. \nApplicant also submitted a letter from an attorney, who is the president of a flying\nclub, of which Applicant has served as the co-treasurer and director (Ex E). He\nendorsed Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance, describing him as a man of\n\u201creliability honesty and integrity.\u201d\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\n\n4\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[W]hen\nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s application and receipt of a Dutch passport raises foreign preference\nconcerns under Disqualifying Condition (DC) 10 (a) (1) the exercise of the privilege of\nforeign citizenship, by possession of a current foreign passport. DC 10 (b) also applies\nas Applicant did acquire a foreign citizenship even though he was born a United States\ncitizen. \n\n5\nHowever, Applicant did destroy or invalidate his foreign passport, by turning it\nover to his employer\u2019s security director, who has shredded it and maintains the remains\nin the company safe. Therefore, I find that Mitigating Conditions (MC) (e) under this\nguideline apply to this case. After considering all of the evidence of record on Guideline\nC, I conclude that the mitigating evidence outweighs the disqualifying evidence. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The basic factors I have considered\nin reviewing this case under the whole person concept include the fact that Applicant\nwas born in the United States  and has lived here for the last 14 years. His wife is also a\nUnited States citizen. All of his considerable assets are in the United States. He\ndestroyed his Dutch passport, and he has never lived in Netherlands nor took part in\nany Dutch elections. Based on all of the reasons cited above, I find that the record\nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance under the whole person concept. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

(SOR \u00b6 2.a.)  \n \nApplicant credibly explained that his failure to list his debts discussed supra was \ndue to his mistaken impression that since he was working with a debt management \ncompany, and was making payments, that he \u201cwould be at a current status.\u201d Tr. 52-53. \nHe understands his answer is incorrect and if answering the questions today, he would \nanswer them differently. \n \nApplicant submitted his latest work performance evaluation, which reflects a \n\u201cLevel A\u201d rating, which is the highest of four ratings offered by his employer. AE K. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Foremost are the \nDisqualifying and Mitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to \nthe facts and circumstances of the case. However, the guidelines are not viewed as \ninflexible ironclad rules of law. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. Each decision \nmust also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in \nSection 6.3 of the Directive,1 and the whole person concept.2 Having considered the \n \n1  Directive, Section 6.3. \u201cEach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense \ndetermination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent \ncriteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2 . . .\u201d \n \n             2  Directive \u00b6 2(a)  \u201c. . .

To meet its burden, the government must \nestablish a prima facie case by substantial evidence.4 The responsibility then shifts to \nthe applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one \nhas a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries the ultimate burden of \npersuasion.5  \n \n \nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, \ntherefore, has a compelling interest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite \njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as \nhis or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels \nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information in favor of protecting national security.6 \n \nConclusions \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations),7 the government\u2019s concern is that \nan Applicant\u2019s \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who \nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant has a history of failing to meet his financial obligations dating back to \n2005/6. Since then, he has accumulated four collection/delinquent/charged off accounts \nowing approximately $28,478. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) \n \n \n3  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n4  ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999) (Substantial evidence is more than a \nscintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence); ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3 (App. Bd.

The financial toll of this unexpected income loss placed Applicant in a \nprecarious financial situation from which he is still recovering. Unfortunately, his career \nchange and loss of income due to training forced him to live off his credit cards. These \nfacts demonstrate circumstances beyond his control.  \n \n \nApplicant provided documentation demonstrating that he paid one of his debts in \nfull and contacted a debt management company before his SOR was issued, and has \nestablished a realistic payment plan. He began making payments by direct debit on his \nplan in October 2007, and has remained current. His evidence reflects he has the \nresolve and wherewithal to pay down his debts.  \n \n \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,8 I conclude that two of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) \nGuidelines \u00b6 20(b): The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances; and FC MC \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; apply in this \ncase.  \n \nHe presented evidence showing he dealt responsibly with his financial \nobligations as demonstrated by contacting a credit counseling service before his SOR \nwas issued and established a payment plan that has remained current. His \ndemonstrated efforts establish he is committed to resolving this matter. His choice to \ncomplete this training proved to be a good one and has provided him with a new skill set \nfor a better paying job. Applicant\u2019s evidence sustains a finding that he is financially \nresponsible and has taken control of his financial situation. Based on the available \nevidence, his financial problems are not likely to be a concern in the future.   \n \nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct), conduct involving questionable judgment, \nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can \nraise questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. Guidelines & 15. \n \nThe government\u2019s evidence established that he failed to disclose relevant \ninformation in his answers to questions 28.a. and 28.b. of his security clearance \napplication. Considering the record as a whole, I am convinced Applicant inadvertently \n \n8  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered as \na whole. \n\n \n \n6\nfailed to disclose this information. Numerous factors weighed in my analysis to reach \nthat conclusion, including: Applicant=s age, his level of education, his employment \nhistory, his demeanor and testimony, the number and value of the debts, and the  \ncredibility of his explanation. While he should have exercised greater diligence and care \nin completing his security clearance application, I do not find his failure to disclose his \ndebts deliberate. Accordingly, no disqualifying conditions are applicable foregoing the \nnecessity of discussing mitigating conditions. \n \n \nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines. I applied the \nwhole person concept. I specifically considered Applicant\u2019s age, education, his ten \nyears honorable Army service, his past history of successfully holding a security \nclearance, his maturity, his years working for defense contractors, work performance \nevaluation, commitment to his family, and his demeanor and conduct during his hearing. \nConsidering the totality of Applicant\u2019s circumstances, he demonstrated sufficient \njudgment and trustworthiness in the handling of his financial affairs. Furthermore, his \nalleged falsifications were not deliberate. In short, he has mitigated the security \nconcerns raised.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d.: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nDecision \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance \nfor Applicant.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of Case\nOn February 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992,\nand Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 14, 2008 and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on April 2, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on May\n1, 2008.  A hearing was held on May 1, 2008, for the purpose of considering whether it\nwould be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, or deny,\nApplicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case\nconsisted of five exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (herself) and nine exhibits.\nThe transcript (R.T.) was received on May 20, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case\nAugust 20, 2008\n\n2\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied. \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Appellant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of her bank statements.  For good cause shown, Applicant\nwas granted seven days, to May 11, 2008 (R.T., at 82), to supplement the record. The\nGovernment was afforded two days to respond.  Within the time permitted, Applicant\nsupplemented the record with documented copies of a creditor\u2019s motion for summary\njudgment and the entered summary judgment in the creditor\u2019s behalf.  her bank\nstatements and character references.  Department counsel did not object to these post-\nhearing submissions.  Her post-hearing exhibits were admitted and considered.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) accumulated 10 debts\nexceeding $11,600.00 and (b) submitted a personal financial statement in September\n200 that indicates a monthly remainder of $119.00 without any reflected monthly\npayments on her listed delinquent debts.  For her answer to the SOR, Applicant\nadmitted all of the of the allegations.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 54-year-old flight service center representative for a defense\ncontractor who seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and\nadmitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material\nfindings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant is married and has three grown children.  Two of her children reside\nwith her: her daughter and one of her sons (R.T., at 45).  Applicant  provides financial\nsupport only for her son. \nBetween 2002 and 2005, Applicant accumulated 10 delinquent debts, exceeding\n$11,600.00.  She attributes these debts to financial setbacks she experienced in 1988.\nIn 1988, she met a man with whom she lived with for the ensuing 13 years (R.T., at  64).\nWhile he lived with her, he paid the rent on the house they shared and aided in the care\nof her children.  In or about 1998, Applicant and her boyfriend determined to buy a\nhouse together.  Because of his credit problems, they could not obtain the necessary\njoint financing (R.T., at 64).  So, Applicant purchased the house with her own financing.\nAbout a year after they closed on the house, her boyfriend vacated the premises and\nleft her with a mortgage to service by herself.  \nBurdened with household and mortgage expenses, Applicant struggled paying\nher bills.  She did some prioritizing with her mortgage and let some of her other debts\nslip (R.T., at 64-65).  In 2002, she was diagnosed with skin cancer on her nose.\n\n3\nBelieving at the time that her scheduled surgery would be paid for by her medical\ninsurance carrier, she went ahead with the surgery (R.T., at 66-67).  She was later told\nthat her company declined to pay on her medical insurance policy (R.T., at 67-68).  This\nleft her without any coverage (R.T., at 68).  Many of the medical bills listed in the SOR\n(creditors 1.a, 1.c, and 1.g through 1.j) are related to her cancer surgery and treatment\n(R.T., at 66-67). \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s listed debts, however, are not medical-related.   One of the\nlisted debts is a medical creditor (creditor 1.a) who obtained a judgment against\nApplicant in June 2002 in the amount of $1,709.17.  Applicant resolved this judgment\nwith the creditor in April 2005, and obtained a release of judgment (see ex. A; R.T., at\n48-49).\nBesides her creditor 1.a debt, Applicant provides documentation of her payment\nof three of her smaller debts, i.e., her creditor 1.b/1.I debt (a duplication), her creditor 1.f\ndebt, and her creditor 1.j debt (see exs. B, C,  and F; R.T., at 50-55, 61-62).  \nApplicant is still working on her remaining debts.  She was able to work out a\npayment plan with one of her creditors.  With creditor 1.g (a medical account with a\n$4,113.00 balance), she documents payment of $113.50 in April 2008 and commits to\npaying $100.00 a month to the creditor (see ex. E; R.T., at 51-52).  But she has yet to\ncontact creditors 1.c, 1.d, 1.e and 1.h (R.T., at 55-59). \nOf her four remaining debts, creditor 1.e holds the largest credit balance.  It\nrepresents a deficiency on a repossessed car she co-signed for her daughter in 1996\nfor about $12,000.00 (see ex. 4; R.T., at 76-77).  When her son-in-law lost his job, they\nbegan falling behind in their payments.  Unable to help her daughter with the car\npayments, Applicant and her daughter eventually acceded (sometime in 2000) to the\ncreditor\u2019s repossession of the car (R.T., at 78-79).  Following the hearing, Applicant\nprovided copies of the entry of a February 2006 order granting summary judgment on\nthe creditor\u2019s claimed deficiency against Applicant in the aggregate amount of\n$5,104.53, plus assessed attorneys fees of $1,850.00 (see ex. J).   Applicant says she\npaid about $10,000.00 on the vehicle before it was repossessed. She believed she was\nnotified of the net deficiency following resale of the vehicle and was afforded an\nopportunity to supplement the record with sale information (R.T., at 80-82). Her post-\nhearing documentation, however, reflects a considerably larger deficiency resulting in\njudgment and does not include any evidence of payment or payment arrangements with\nthe creditor.\nApplicant did pursue financial counseling in 2001 after her finances tightened\nover her mortgage (R.T., at 68-69).  With the help of her counselor, she developed a\nbudget.  Because her debts exceeded her income at the time, her counselor could not\nhelp her any further (R.T., at 68).  She has not pursued any further financial counseling\n(R.T., at 70). \n\n4\nIn her most recent personal financial statement she completed in September\n2007, Applicant listed net monthly income of $1,928.92, monthly household expenses of\n$454.00, and household debts of $1,355.00 (see ex. 2).  She listed a personal monthly\nremainder of just $119.00.  However, this remainder did not reflect any payments on her\naccrued delinquent debts (see ex. 2).  She has had no success finding a second job\n(R.T., at 70).  \nEven with her limited resources, Applicant was able to purchase a 2008 vehicle\nin February 2008 for around $19,000.00.  Her $430.00 monthly payments on this\nvehicle are not included in her personal financial statement (R.T., at 71-72).  Besides\nthis new 2008 vehicle, she owns a 2005 vehicle, which she purchased in her name for\nabout $10,000.00 (R.T., at 72).  Without enough income herself to cover her car\npayments on this second vehicle, she must look to her daughter to make these\npayments (R.T., at 72).\nWhile Applicant has a 401(k) plan, the account has been frozen by her employer\n(R.T., at 72-73).  She has no known outstanding debts besides the listed debts and\nappears to enjoy a comfortable working relationship with her coworkers.  \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\n\n5\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts.\u201d Adjudication Guidelines, \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nFollowing a break-up with a former boyfriend (whom she relied on for financial\nsupport) in the late 1990s, Applicant fell behind with a number of her creditors.  Several\nof her major debts either remain unresolved or have only recently been addressed.\nAbsent documented discharge or payment initiatives with her remaining listed creditors,\nthese debts raise security significant concerns.  \n In Applicant\u2019s case, her still outstanding delinquent debts warrant the application\nof two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines for financial considerations:\nDC 19 (a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and DC 19(c), \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d These disqualifying conditions cover the core concern of\nAG \u00b6 18: poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, which, both individually and collectively, can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to safely occupy a position of trust.  \n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s accumulated debts are attributable in part to her dissolution of a\nlongstanding relationship with a boyfriend she relied on for financial assistance.  Some of\nher debts are medically related to treatment she received for a skin cancer condition\nfollowing her cancer diagnosis in 2002.  Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties are associated\nwith her reduced support and medical issues.  Together, her described difficulties\nprovide enough extenuating circumstances to warrant some application of mitigating\nconditions covered by AG \u00b6 18.  MC 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d has application.\nAt this time, not all of Applicant\u2019s covered debts are documented to have been\npaid, disputed, or settled.  They exceed $7,000.00 in the aggregate and represent a\nconsiderable debt load on her current income sources.  Her documented recent\nsettlement arrangement with creditor 1.g entails a recent $113.00 payment and a\ncommitment to make monthly payments in the future.  While encouraging, this payment\narrangement is very recent and reflects too little seasoning (just one payment so far) to\nwarrant any significant mitigation weight.  In fairness to Applicant, she is able to\ndocument payment of several of her other listed debts.  These payments cover her\nsmaller debts, except, for creditor 1.a\u2019s judgment debt. \nWithout more documented information to demonstrate she is addressing her listed\ndebts and making use of financial counseling, she cannot safely mitigate all of the\nGovernment\u2019s financial concerns.  Holding a security clearance involves the exercise of\nimportant fiducial responsibilities, which include the expectancy of consistent trust and\ncandor.  Financial stability in a person cleared for access to classified information is\nrequired precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While\nthe principal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in\nfinancial cases.\nUse of a whole person assessment that takes into account all of the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt accumulations is insufficient to enable\nApplicant to surmount security concerns independent of the express disqualifying\nconditions covered by AG\u00b6 18.  Without more exhibited payment seasoning and work-\nout efforts to demonstrate progress in resolving her remaining debts, it is difficult to draw\nconvincing conclusions about her overall trustworthiness based on factors not covered in\nthe mitigation conditions of the guideline for financial considerations.  Based on her\ncurrent income, it does not appear likely that Applicant will be in a position to make any\nmaterial reductions in her debts in the foreseeable future.\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\nunsatisfied debts and overall presentation of payment histories, Applicant does not\nmitigate security concerns related to her still outstanding debts.  Unfavorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to the allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.c through 1.e, 1.g,\n\n7\n1.h, and1.k).   Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paragraphs 1.a and\n1.b, 1.f, 1.i., and 1.j.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT   \nSub-para. 1.a\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.f:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.g:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.h:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1. i:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.j:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1. k:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by her financial history. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn March 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 25, 2008, and elected to have the \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted \nthe government\u2019s written case on May 9, 2008. A complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file \nJuly 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \nApplicant received the FORM on May 16, 2008. She responded with an undated letter. \nDepartment Counsel did not object to her response. I received the case assignment on \nJuly 21, 2008. I have marked Applicant\u2019s response as Exhibit (Ex.) A, and it is admitted.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nthe same company since 2002. She worked for the company at one location from 2002 \nthrough 2004. She was unemployed for a month and then was rehired by the company \nat a different location in 2004. She has worked there since. Applicant was married, but \ndivorced in 1997. She has not remarried. She has three children, ages 26, 22, and 19.1  \n \n \nApplicant incurred a substantial amount of debts, including unpaid accounts, \njudgments, and a tax lien. The SOR alleges 16 delinquent debts. Applicant admitted to \neight of the debts. She stated that four of the debts were duplicates of other alleged \ndebts. She indicated that three of the debts were paid. She stated that she did not \nrecognize nor have an account with the creditor listed in one allegation.2   \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f, 1.i, and 1.p. The \ndebts total $44,841, which include a judgment against her by a credit card company for \n$7,083. There is no evidence that any of these debts have been paid.3 \n \n \nApplicant stated that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h reflect the same \ndebts as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. After reviewing the evidence, I find that \nApplicant is correct and \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h are duplicates of \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d.4 \n \n \nApplicant further stated that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k are the same \ndebts as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k both reflect a credit card debt of the \nsame amount, $6,365. The credit report of January 9, 2007, which lists the debt to this \ncreditor, only lists this debt once. Clearly \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k are duplicates. The debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.b is to a collection agency, collecting on behalf of the bank that issued the \ncredit card as alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k. After reviewing the evidence, I find that \u00b6\u00b6 1.j \nand 1.k are duplicates of each other and of \u00b6 1.b.5 \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l for $2,809. She did not \nrecognize the collection company named in the allegation. A review of the credit report \nof January 9, 2007, shows this collection company collecting for the bank that obtained \n                                                          \n1 Ex. 4. \n \n2 Ex. 3. \n \n3 Id. \n \n4 Ex. 3, 5-8. \n \n5 Id. \n \n\n \n3 \n \na judgment against Applicant, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o. I find that \u00b6 1.l is a duplicate of \n1.o.6  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m alleges a state tax lien filed against Applicant for $3,206. She denied \nowing this debt and stated the lien was released in 1997. She provided detailed \ninformation, including the book and page number where the lien release is recorded. \nShe further stated: \u201cIf you need to see a copy of the lien release, please let me know \nand I will leave work early one day and retrieve a copy.\u201d I am satisfied that this tax debt \nwas paid and the lien released.7  \n \n \nApplicant stated that the judgment against her for $6,374, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.n, was paid through a garnishment of her wages. Her documents establish that this \njudgment was paid through a garnishment, with the last payment in July 2005.8  \n \n \nApplicant also stated that the judgment against her for $2,839, as alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.o, was paid through a garnishment of her wages. The documents she submitted \nshow that a separate judgment for a different bank was paid through garnishment. \nThere was no documentation that the judgment in \u00b6 1.o was paid.9  \n \n \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to \u201ca horrible divorce where [her] ex-\nhusband put [her] through hell for years and [she] was left to raise three beautiful \nchildren.\u201d She stated that she incurred \u201chuge lawyer and accountant fees that pushed \n[her] to this level of debt.\u201d She also stated on her security clearance application, \u201cI was \nvery irresponsible with my money and have learned a valuable lesson.\u201d She has ruled \nout bankruptcy because she wants to pay her debts. She stated that she was \u201cseeking \ndebt management options on how to pay this debt back,\u201d and that she plans \u201cto slowly \npay everything back that [she owes].\u201d10  \n \n \nApplicant has a clean criminal record. She stated that she has received only one \nspeeding ticket in her life, and that was 30 rears ago.11 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n                                                          \n6 Ex. 3, 6. \n \n7 Ex. 3. \n \n8 Ex. 3, 5-8. \n \n9 Id. \n \n10 Ex. 3, 4, A. \n \n11 Ex. 4, A. \n \n\n \n4 \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n\n \n5 \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable to pay her \nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise both of these \npotentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant still owes most of the debts alleged in the SOR. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \napplicable. She went through a bad divorce, raised three children, and had some \nperiods of unemployment. However the divorce was final in 1997, and she has been \n\n \n6 \n \nsteadily employed since 2004. She also admitted that she was very irresponsible with \nher money. Applicant did not submit sufficient information to warrant the full benefit of \nAG \u00b6 20(b).  \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant received counseling for her financial \nproblems. Other than the tax lien that was paid and released in 1997, the only debts \nthat have been paid have been through garnishment of her wages. Based upon all the \nevidence, I am unable to make an affirmative finding that those payments are sufficient \nto constitute a \u201cgood-faith effort\u201d to repay her overdue creditors or otherwise resolve her \ndebts. I also do not find that there are clear indications that her problem is being \nresolved or is under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not applicable. AG \u00b6 20(e) is \napplicable to the debts that are duplicates, as discussed in the Findings of Fact. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a clean criminal \nrecord, but she has a substantial amount of delinquent debt. She owes more than \n$46,000 in consumer debt and unpaid judgments. She wants to pay her debts, but at \nthis time she has no clear plan on how that would be accomplished. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nFinancial Considerations security concerns. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.h: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.m: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.o-1.p: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nEdward W.

MacKinnon, Esquire\nDeputy Chief Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 4 November 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline H.  Applicant answered the SOR 1 December 2008, and requested a hearing.\n1\nDOHA assigned the case to me 3 February 2009, and I convened a hearing 16 March\n2009. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 20 March 2009.\n \nMarch 30, 2009\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 62-year-old senior technical\ndirector employed by a defense contractor for more than 20 years. He seeks to retain\nthe clearance he has held during his 20 years military service and 24 years as a\ndefense contractor. He had an exemplary military record, served in Viet Nam, and\nearned numerous awards and ribbons appropriate to his period of service\u2014including\ntwo Meritorious Service Medals.\nApplicant began using marijuana in 1995, when his domestic partner\u2014an AIDS\nsufferer\u2014brought some home to use as an appetite stimulant. Applicant joined him out\nof solidarity. The marijuana worked as an appetite stimulant, and Applicant has\ncontinued to use with his partner daily to weekly since, including the day before the\nhearing. Applicant has purchased marijuana for his personal use between 1995 and the\nday before the hearing.\nIn August 2004, Applicant was arrested for marijuana possession at an airport,\nwhile traveling to see his father. His case was placed on the stet docket, after which it\nwould be deleted from his record if he had no further criminal conduct. Applicant\ncomplied with the requirement that he seek a drug evaluation, but was told by the\nprogram he consulted that he did not need to complete a program because he had no\ndependence issues. He continued to use marijuana after this arrest. He did not advise\nhis employer of the arrest.\nApplicant disclosed this drug history on a clearance application he executed in\nMarch 2006 (G.E. 1). He disclosed essentially the same information during a December\n2006 subject interview (G.E. 3). However, the subject interview and later answers to\ninterrogatories (G.E.4) in July 2008 revealed that he had misrepresented the amount\nand frequency of his marijuana use on his clearance application. On his SF 86, he\nclaimed to have used marijuana only 10 times between 1995 and the date of his\nclearance application.\nDuring his October 2006 subject interview, Applicant stated his intent to continue\nto use marijuana with his partner. However, in July 2008, he pledged to stop his\nmarijuana use in order to retain his clearance. Nevertheless, he concluded that\nrefraining from marijuana use just to retain his clearance was pointless unless and until\nhe retained his clearance. He continued to use up to the day before the hearing as\ndescribed above.\nAt hearing, Applicant pledged to stop using marijuana on a start date acceptable\nto the government if he can retain his clearance. He knew that marijuana use was\nprohibited by the military during his career, and knows it is prohibited by both his\nemployer and the government. He believes that his marijuana use is no big deal, that he\nwas candid about his drug use with the government, and that the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept of the Directive should be applied to retain his clearance.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b625(a) any drug abuse ; (c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase,\n3\nsale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; (g) any illegal drug use after being granted a\nclearance; (h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to\ndiscontinue drug use.\n3\nApplicant is a good employee (A.E. C), with over 20 years of service. He has not\nexecuted a formal drug statement of intent as contemplated by RAG \u00b626(b)(4) of the\nDirective.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline H\n(Drug Involvement).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H by\nestablishing Applicant\u2019s use and purchase of marijuana between 1995 and March\n2009.  Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns about his marijuana use,\n3\nwhich began over 13 years ago. It has continued long past the point where he was\n\n\u00b6 26.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\n4\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment [Emphasis supplied];\n\u00b6 26.(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug\n5\nusing associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation.\n4\naware of the potential consequences for his employment and clearance. He continued\nmarijuana use after August 2004 despite his marijuana possession arrest. He continued\ndespite company policy, government policy, and criminal proscription. His use was\nrecent, and under the circumstances likely to recur.   He has not demonstrated an intent\n4\nto not abuse marijuana in the future.  Applicant\u2019s newly-stated willingness to cease\n5\nmarijuana use is hardly convincing or unconditional. Under the circumstances of this\ncase, I can give it no credence. A \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis avails him not, in part\nbecause recognition for 20-years service does not establish the kind of employment\ncharacterization Applicant would have me find, and in part because a  whole person\nanalysis cannot overcome the plain disqualification of Applicant\u2019s continuous marijuana\nuse since 1995, absent extraordinary circumstances not present here. Applicant offers\nnothing in the way of changed circumstances to give credence to his intent to refrain\nfrom marijuana use in the future. Indeed, nothing has changed except his desire to\nretain his clearance. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1. Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a-d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.

On March 24, 2008, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant,\nwhich detailed security concerns under Guideline B stating why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant, and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29, 2005,\nand effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \n \n\n2\nThe Applicant answered the SOR in writing on March 31, 2008, and April 8,\n2008, and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel\nwas prepared to proceed on May 21, 2008.  This case was assigned to me on May 28,\n2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 11, 2008, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on July 1, 2008. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 and 2,\nwhich were received without objection. The Applicant testified on his own behalf, called\none additional witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through E.  DOHA received\nthe transcript of the hearing, and the record closed, on July 11, 2008.  Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nProcedural Ruling\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. (Transcript at 15-21.) The\nrequest and the allied documents were not admitted into evidence, but are included in\nthe record.  The Applicant had a specific objection to one statement in the\nGovernment\u2019s request.  I took notice of that objection, and have considered it in this\ndecision.  (Transcript at 20.)  The facts administratively noticed are limited to matters of\ngeneral knowledge and not subject to reasonable dispute.  The facts administratively\nnoticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 59 and married with two American born children.  He is\nemployed by a Defense contractor as a Cultural Advisor/Interpreter and seeks a\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry.  In his\nAnswers to the SOR, Applicant admitted allegations 1.a. and 1.c. in the Statement of\nReasons.  He denied allegation 1.b.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)  \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has foreign contacts and interests that could lead to the exercise\nof poor judgment, unreliability or untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\nThe Applicant was born in Afghanistan in 1949.  In addition to his parents, he had\ntwo brothers.  His older brother has passed away.  The Applicant first came to the\nUnited States in 1966-67 to attend a high school student exchange program.  He\nreturned to the United States in 1976 to attend graduate school.  He received his\nMaster\u2019s degree in 1978.  \n\nOther statements concerning the Applicant\u2019s pride in being an American citizen can be found in the Transcript\n1\nat pages 63 and 67.\n3\nAfter the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, the Applicant asked for and was\ngranted asylum in the United States.   He became an American citizen on July 3, 1986.\nHe said the following regarding this decision, \u201cI found the place [the United States] a\nfree country so that I can live and I can talk and I can do whatever I want to do within\nthe, of course, framework of law.  So I decided to stay in United States and ask for\ncitizenship.\u201d  (Transcript at 48-50; Government Exhibit 1 at Section 8.)1\nThe Applicant married his Afghan born wife on August 20, 1978.  She became a\nnaturalized American citizen on February 17, 1989.  (Government Exhibit 1 at Section\n15.)  As stated above, they have two American born children.\nThe Applicant worked at several jobs over the years after 1978, including working\nfor the post office.  He worked at the post office from 1992 until 2004.  (Transcript at 50-\n54.)  The Applicant further testified:\n2004, I found out that I can be used as a - - I can use my language,\ngo to Afghanistan, help my birthplace as well as help my country which I\nlive in and I love the freedom that I have and I can use my talent.  I can\nuse my ability.  So I took one year leave without pay, went to Afghanistan,\n2004, July of 2004.  (Transcript at 54.)\nThe Applicant served in Afghanistan in 2004 and again in 2006-07.  During his\ntime in Afghanistan the Applicant had several important assignments with various units,\nand served with several high ranking American officers throughout the country.  He\nserved with bravery, was in combat, and was injured in a non-combat incident.\n(Transcript at 54-60.)  Because of his injury, the Applicant was unable to return to\nAfghanistan, but has been used as a cultural advisor to help prepare American forces\nfor Afghanistan.  (Transcript at 60-61.)\n As stated earlier, the Applicant left Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion.  His\nparents and brothers fled to Pakistan after the invasion.  His parents and one brother\nhave passed away.  The Applicant\u2019s other brother has returned to Pakistan and works\nfor the current Afghan government.  At one point the Applicant would send this brother\nmoney, when his family lived in Pakistan.  The Applicant no longer sends his brother\nany money.  (Transcript at 45-46, 66.)  In response to a question from Department\nCounsel about what the Applicant would do if approached by his brother, or anyone\nelse, to reveal information about the United States, he stated, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t respond to him\nat all or to her or anybody asking us about any of those because part of my duty, I know\nwhat\u2019s my duty as a U.S. citizen.  I would not - - I would not share anything if I know to\nshare with them at all.  No.\u201d  (Transcript at 68.)\nDuring the time he was stationed in Afghanistan, the Applicant visited his brother\nin 2006.  This visit was in conjunction with the wedding of his nephew.  This visit was\n\nAll of the following statements are supported by the documents submitted by the Department Counsel in\n2\nsupport of his request for administrative notice.  (Administrative Notice Documents I through VIII.)\n4\nmade with the knowledge and permission of the Applicant\u2019s chain-of-command.  After\nthe wedding, the Applicant wrote a report about what he had seen and learned.\n(Transcript at 46-47, 66-67.)\nA senior officer in the United States Armed Forces who served with the Applicant\nin Afghanistan testified on his behalf.  During his entire testimony the witness described\nevents where the Applicant\u2019s presence and his abilities were useful and worthwhile.\n(Transcript at 28-42.)  This officer held a senior staff post during his tour in Afghanistan,\nduring which time the Applicant acted as his interpreter for ten months and, \u201cperformed\nmagnificently.\u201d  (Transcript at 29.)  Regarding the Applicant\u2019s reliability the witness\nstated, \u201cI would trust my life to this man.  I have trusted my life to this man.\u201d  (Transcript\nat 31.)  The witness also said, \u201cHe [the Applicant] is an American hero.\u201d  (Transcript at\n31.)  The witness has personal knowledge of the importance of security clearances in\nhis military job.  Concerning the Applicant the witness stated, \u201cHe [the Applicant] never\ngave me any reason to doubt his trustworthiness.\u201d  (Transcript at 31-32.)  \nThe Applicant submitted several statements from Soldiers he served with\nattesting to his capabilities and contributions to the U.S. Armed Forces\u2019 efforts in the\nGlobal War on Terror throughout his time in Afghanistan.  Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A contains\nstatements from 2007 and 2008, including one from his current civilian employer about\nhis job.  The statement dated February 1, 2007, is particularly worthwhile, since it is\nfrom the officer who commanded the unit the Applicant supported in 2006.  This officer\ndescribes the Applicant as \u201cconscientious, prompt, articulate in multiple languages,\ndedicated, and absolutely fearless under the most stressful circumstances.\u201d\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 4.)    \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits B, C and D are letters of recommendation from 2004 and\n2005, as well as various certificates of appreciation from units he served with in\nAfghanistan.  All of these documents confirm that the Applicant served ably and with\ncourage under difficult circumstances.\nThe Applicant has contacts with Afghanistan.  Accordingly, it is appropriate to\ndiscuss the relationship between Afghanistan and the United States at this time.   In\n2\n2001-2002, the United States led a coalition to remove the Taliban from power in\nAfghanistan.  After free elections, Afghanistan\u2019s new government took office.  Despite\nthe elections and new government, Afghanistan suffers from continuing violence,\nperpetrated by Taliban terrorists and other insurgents, including Al Qa\u2019ida.  Numerous\nattacks and kidnappings have targeted members of the U.S. Armed Forces, their allies,\ncontractors, and other civilians, as well as Afghans.  The Afghani armed forces are\nimproving, but are still unable to secure the country on their own.  The threat of\nterrorism in Afghanistan remains high.  Terrorist groups conduct intelligence activities as\neffectively as state intelligence services.\n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n6\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that the Applicant has family members in Afghanistan (Guideline B).  The\nApplicant, on the other hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nThe concern under Guideline B is styled as follows:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in\nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\nIn this case, Applicant has contact with his one brother who remains in\nAfghanistan and works for the Afghan government.  It is worth noting that the Applicant\nhad not traveled to Afghanistan for over 25 years before going there as a translator for\nthe U.S. military.  His relationship with his brother in Afghanistan, tenuous though it is,\ndoes create a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because of\nhis brother\u2019s employment, and the fact that terrorists in the Middle East seek intelligence\nand are hostile to the United States\u2019 interests.\nBased on the evidence the Government has presented, the following\nDisqualifying Conditions apply to this case: 7.(a) Contact with a foreign family member .\n. . who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and (b)\nconnections to a foreign person . . . that create a potential conflict of interest between\n\n7\nthe individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that information. \nThe Applicant has provided compelling evidence to show that the following\nMitigating Conditions also apply to this particular case, given his particular background:\n8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.; and (b) There is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.\n \nAfghanistan is not a safe place for anyone, that much is true.  It is a war zone.\nHowever, there is substantial evidence that the Applicant behaved in a courageous and\nhonorable way during his tours of duty in Afghanistan.  Officers and senior non-\ncommissioned officers from both the Army and Navy testified and submitted glowing\nwritten statements discussing the Applicant\u2019s activities in Afghanistan, his integrity, and\nspecifically his ability to safeguard classified information in a combat area.\n  Applicant established application of Mitigating Conditions 8(a) and (b).  Based\non his relationships and depth of loyalty to the United States, he can be expected to\nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States interest.  He has lived in the\nUnited States since 1976, after going to high school here in the 1960s, and did not\nreturn to Afghanistan until his employment with the U.S. Armed Forces in 2004.  The\nApplicant has been a naturalized American citizen for over 20 years, and his wife for\nover 18 years.  Both of his sons are native-born American citizens.  He has limited\ncontact with his brother living in Afghanistan and there is no evidence that he has\nconnections or contact with anyone over there other than his brother.\n Whole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\n\n8\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nThe DOHA Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence\nof an applicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties\nto the U.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the\nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 04-00540\nat 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).)\nThe Applicant\u2019s ties to the United States are much stronger than his ties to his\none brother living in Afghanistan.  There is no evidence that he has ever taken any\naction that could cause potential harm to the United States or members of its military.\nOn the contrary, there is substantial evidence that he was a respected member of the\nteam while serving in Afghanistan.  Military members who served with him find him to be\nloyal, trustworthy, conscientious and eligible for a security clearance and access to\nclassified information.  As stated earlier, after leaving Afghanistan in 1976, he did not\nreturn until 2004.\n    \nApplicant served in Afghanistan without any indication that he had breached\nsecurity policies or procedures.  While that fact is not normally to be considered a factor\nin granting a clearance, the Appeal Board stated in ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App.\nBd. Nov. 14, 2006) the following:\nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s\nprior history of complying with security procedures and regulations\nsignificant probative value for purposes of refuting, mitigating, or\nextenuating the security concerns raised by the applicant\u2019s more\nimmediate disqualifying conduct or circumstances.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 01-03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at\n5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd.\nMay 30, 2006).  However, the Board has recognized an exception to that\ngeneral rule in Guideline B cases, where the applicant has established by\ncredible, independent evidence that his compliance with security\nprocedures and regulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk\ncircumstances in which the applicant had made a significant contribution\nto the national security.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App.\nBd. July 14, 2006).  The presence of such circumstances can give\ncredibility to an applicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to\nrecognize, resist and report a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or\nexploitation.  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I have particularly considered the\npossibilities of terrorist activities in Afghanistan and the fact the Applicant\u2019s brother still\nlives there and works for the Afghan government.  The evidence shows that the\nApplicant is a patriotic American citizen.  The Applicant eloquently testified about the\n\nI conclude that the whole person analysis weighs heavily toward approval of the Applicant\u2019s security\n3\nclearance.  Assuming a higher authority reviewing this decision determines that the mitigating conditions\narticulated under Mitigating Conditions 8(a) and (b) do not apply and severs any consideration of them, I find\nthat the whole person analysis standing alone is sufficient to support approval of a security clearance in this\ncase.\n9\nimportance of his family in the United States, and his pride in being an American citizen,\nto have served in Afghanistan, and be a member of the defense industry.  He is\nknowledgeable about security and understands his responsibility.  I find that there is\nlittle or no \u201cpotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress\u201d as set forth in AG \u00b6\n2(a)(8).  Using the whole person standard, the Applicant has mitigated the security\nsignificance of his foreign connections and is eligible for a security clearance.  \n3\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Murphy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 11,  2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 27, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Kathryn M.\nBraeman granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely\nappeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s application\nof the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FCMC) is unsupported by record evidence;\nand whether the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis is unsupported by record evidence.  Finding error,\nwe reverse.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nApplicant is a financial analyst for a defense contractor, making sure that obligated funds are\nappropriately expended and that his employer\u2019s projects do not overspend their budgets.  He holds\na B.A. degree in accounting.  He has four delinquent debts alleged in the SOR, for $11,572, $11,211,\n$15,068, and approximately $6000.  He has settled one debt but does not have sufficient funds to\nsettle the remaining three, although they are now unenforceable due to the statute of limitations.  He\nhas had no adverse debts withing the five years preceding the decision.\nAt the hearing, Applicant stated that his bad debts were due to \u201cpoor credit and cash flow\nmanagement.\u201d  (Decision at 3).  He had charged some of his college tuition expenses on his credit\ncards.  In addition, Applicant\u2019s financial history has been affected by his efforts to assist his son in\npaying medical bills on behalf on his grandson, who had a brain tumor.  It has also been affected by\nhis own loss of a job due to \u201cnot learning it fast enough,\u201d (Decision at 4) and to his wife not being\nable to work due to health problems.  Applicant earns $50,000 annually.  In addition, he receives a\ngift of $11,000 each year from his mother.  He owns a house worth approximately $200,000, which\nis paid off.  He also owns two cars, both of which are also paid off.  Applicant owns a classic car\nworth about $30,000.  At the time of the hearing he had no formal budget, because his wife handled\nall the family finances.\nB.  Discussion\n\n3\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \nDepartment Counsel has not challenged the Judge\u2019s findings.  His argument that the Judge\u2019s\ndecision is not supported by record evidence will be addressed below.  \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\n\n4\nThe Judge extended favorable application to FCMC 20(a) through (d).  Department Counsel\nargues persuasively that the Judge\u2019s conclusions are not supported by the record evidence.  For\nexample, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not recent, insofar as there is\nno evidence of additional delinquent debt since 2003.  (See Directive \u00b6 E2.20(a): \u201c[T]he behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt upon the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment . . .\u201d)  Department Counsel argues on appeal that Applicant\u2019s use of a credit card to pay\ntuition expenses does not demonstrate the good judgment required by this mitigating condition.\nFurthermore, the ongoing nature of the remaining three debts vitiates a conclusion that Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems are not recent or that they do not impugn his trustworthiness or reliability.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03695 at (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002) (Failure to discharge debts is \u201ca\ncontinuing course of conduct\u201d that precludes a finding that the debts are attenuated.)  As Department\nCounsel notes, a strategy of merely waiting out creditors is not an adequate substitute for serious and\nreasonable efforts to pay off debts. \nRegarding FCMC 20(b), the Judge noted Applicant\u2019s efforts to assist with his grandson\u2019s\nmedical bills and his loss of employment.  (See Directive \u00b6 E2.29(b): \u201c[T]he conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances . . .\u201d)  However, Department Counsel persuasively argues that,\nviewed as a whole, Applicant\u2019s bad debts did not originate from causes outside his control. \nDepartment Counsel cites Applicant\u2019s decision to pay tuition costs by means of a credit card and his\nhaving been fired due to having not mastered his job.  These circumstances  appear to have resulted\nfrom Applicant\u2019s own conduct rather than from events that intruded upon him.  In any event, the fact\nthat Applicant has permitted the three remaining debts to linger despite a net worth in excess of\n$200,000 undermines the Judge\u2019s conclusion that he has acted reasonably in response to his debts.\nThe Board agrees with Department Counsel that the Judge\u2019s favorable consideration of this FCMC\nis not supported by the evidence.  \nNeither does the record support a favorable application of FCMC 20(c) and (d).  There is no\nrecord evidence of financial counseling, nor does the record support a conclusion that there are \u201cclear\nindications\u201d that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are being resolved.  (Directive \u00b6 E2.20(c): \u201c[T]he\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control . . .\u201d)  In addition to the matters discussed above,\nthe Board notes Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing that he does not keep track of his finances,\nhaving turned that responsibility over to his wife.  (Tr. at 54)  Furthermore, Applicant has not\ndemonstrated a good faith effort to pay off his delinquent debts, relying as he apparently does on the\nstatute of limitations and the fact that his debts have been charged off.  (See Directive \u00b6 E2.20(d):\n\u201c[T]he individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay over due creditors or otherwise resolve debts\n. . .\u201d) (See also ISCR Case No. 06-14521 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2007): \u201c[T]he concept of good faith\n\u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and\nadherence to duty or obligation.\u2019  Accordingly, an applicant must do more than show that he or she\nrelied on a legally available option . . . in order to claim the benefit of [this mitigating condition.\u201d)\n(internal citations omitted)  After examining the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole,\n\n5\nthe Board is persuaded by Department Counsel\u2019s  argument that the record will not sustain a\nfavorable application of the Guideline F mitigating conditions cited in the Judge\u2019s decision.\nFor similar reasons, the Board concludes that the record will not sustain the Judge\u2019s favorable\nwhole-person analysis.  The Judge stated that Applicant \u201cis a sincere person who made substantial\nefforts to reform his financial practices.  There is little potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation,\nor duress because of his stable employment and his substantial assets.\u201d  (Decision at 8)  However,\nin light of Applicant\u2019s unresolved delinquent debts, despite his having sufficient assets and income\nto pay them off, there is a paucity of evidence to support this conclusion by the Judge.  Additionally,\nthe Board notes that, in his response to the SOR, Applicant claimed that all the debts listed in the\nSOR had been \u201csettled for a reduced amount.\u201d  (Response to SOR, October 24, 2007)  This is not\nconsistent with his testimony at the hearing that only one of the debts had been settled, while the\nothers were charged off.  Applicant testified as to his opinion that a charged-off debt is the same as\none that has been settled with the creditor.  (Tr. at 44).  The Judge does not explain why such a\nbelief, even if honestly held, is reasonable in light of Applicant\u2019s degree in accounting and his\nprofessional experience as a financial analyst.  Certainly this testimony is not consistent with a view\nthat Applicant has mitigated the security concern arising under Guideline F, that bad debts can\nevidence a lack of judgment which, in turn, raises questions about an applicant\u2019s reliability.  Viewed\nas a whole, the record does not support the Judge\u2019s favorable decision.  \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.          \n  \nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant:  Pro Se \n \n \n \n____________________ \n \nDecision \n____________________ \n \n \nBRAEMAN, Kathryn M., Administrative Judge: \n \nHistory of the Case \n \n            The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to the Applicant on October 11, 2007. The SOR detailed reasons why \nthe Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the \nApplicant.1 The SOR alleged specific concerns over Financial Considerations \n(Guideline F) in paragraph 1 based on the revised Adjudicative Guidelines2 issued on \nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, to be effective \nSeptember 1, 2006.  As discussed below, clearanc\n \n     1 This procedure is required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), as amended and revised.    \n     2 A copy of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines was sent with his Statement of Reasons (SOR). \nFebruary 27, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant responded to these SOR allegations in a notarized Answer of October \n24, 2007, where he admitted all four of the allegations and requested a hearing.  \n \n            Department Counsel submitted a Ready to Proceed notice on November 28, \n2007.  Subsequently the case was assigned to me on December 3, 2007.  A Notice of \nHearing issued on December 21, 2007, set the matter for January 22, 2008.   \n \n            At the hearing Department Counsel offered three documents (Exhibits 1-3) that \nwere admitted into evidence without objection.  Applicant testified himself.  \nSubsequently, the Department Counsel moved to amend SOR 1.d. to substitute a debt \nof $6,320 instead of $12,797.  (TR 74-76; Exhibits 2, 3)  The Applicant did not object, so \nthis technical amendment was granted. \n \nAt Applicant\u2019s request, and as the Department Counsel did not object, we left the \nrecord open for two weeks until February 5, 2008, in order for Applicant to submit \nsupplemental information.  Department Counsel was granted reasonable time to review \nthe submissions.  (TR 33-35, 82)  Applicant timely submitted his budget (three pages of \nrecords) on January 31, 2008 (Exhibit A); subsequently, two letters of reference were \nsubmitted on February 6, 2008 (Exhibit B). Department Counsel reviewed the \ndocuments and stated on February 6, 2008, that he had no objection to these \ndocuments being admitted into evidence.  However, he questioned Applicant\u2019s budget \nfigures.  In response Applicant submitted a rebuttal letter of February 8, 2008 (Exhibit C) \nwhere he argued that the monthly gift from his mother of $916 should be considered as \nincome.  Department Counsel reviewed this document and on February 13, 2007, made \nno objection to Exhibit C being admitted into evidence.  Subsequently, the record closed \non February 13, 2007.  The transcript (TR) was received on January 29, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n            After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon \ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact: \n \nApplicant, 61 years old, has done financial analysis for a defense contractor in \nState #1 from August 2006 to present.  He was promoted in 2007.  His job is to make \nsure that money obligated to different projects is spent appropriately and that the \nprojects don\u2019t overspend their budget.  Applicant completed a Security Clearance \nApplication (SF 86) to obtain a security clearance in August 2006. Previously he worked \nas an accountant for various mortgage companies.  He has lived at the same address \nsince 2002.  He was unemployed from January to April 2003 and also from June 1995 \nto October 2002 when he was in school.  (Exhibit 1; TR 20, 30-32, 36-38) Applicant \nserved in the U.S. military from November 1966 to October 1970 and was honorably \ndischarged.  (Exhibit 1; TR 38-39)   \n \nApplicant attended a university from 1995 to 2002 in Pennsylvania and received \na Bachelor of Arts degree in April 2002 in accounting.  He married in 1970 and divorced \nin 1975.  He remarried in February 1975.  He adopted Wife #2\u2019s children who were born \n\n \n3 \n \n \nduring her prior marriage:  a son born in 1964, a daughter born in 1968, and another \nson born in 1970.  (Exhibit 1; TR 29-30, 36-37, 40-41, 64-65)   \n \nFinances \n             \n In response to questions on the SF 86 on his Financial Record Applicant \ndisclosed the following: \n \n\u2022 He admitted a debt to Creditor #1 of $11,572 (SOR 1.a.) incurred in June \n2000 and written off as a bad debt in April 2002 per his credit report and \nreferred for collection.  (Answer; Exhibit 1; TR 21, 60-61)  \n \n\u2022 He admitted a debt to Creditor #2 of $11,211 (SOR 1.b) incurred in June \n2001 and charged off as a bad debt in December 2002.  (Answer; Exhibit \n1; TR 21)  \n \nOn the SF 86 Applicant explained that he no longer used credit cards, only debit \ncards.  He stated his past due debts were \u201ccaused by being over extended as a result of \npoor credit and cash flow management.\u201d  He reported he repaid some of his accounts.  \nHe chose not to file for bankruptcy.  If he can, he expressed a willingness to arrange \npayments in the future when he had sufficient funds to repay the debt holders.  (Answer; \nExhibit 1; TR 21, 42-43)  \n \nCredit reports (Exhibits 2, 3) showed additional debts: \n   \n\u2022 He admitted he owed Creditor #3 for a delinquent debt of $15,068 referred \nby a bank for collection (SOR 1.c). \n \n\u2022 He admitted he owed approximately $6,000 to Creditor #4 for a delinquent \naccount charged off as a bad debt in May 2003 and referred for collection \n(SOR 1.d. as amended).  (Answer; Exhibit 1)  As documented in the credit \nreport, he settled this debt by paying them half of the $14,000 due and \nsent them a check for $7,000.  (Exhibits 2, 3; TR 28, 46-48) \n \nWhile he had money to settle one debt, he did not have sufficient funds to \nresolve the other three debts.  (TR 29) The other debtors also did not offer him a \nsettlement.  (TR 45) He asserted that the credit reports document that all of his debts \nhave been written off or settled, so based on his accounting studies he does not believe \nhe needs to take any further action.  These three debts no doubt fall within the state \nstatute of limitations as the creditors took no actions to enforce their rights. In addition, \nthe credit reports show no adverse debts for the past five years. Since 2003 Applicant \nhas not had any additional adverse credit as he relies only on debit cards for payments.  \n(Exhibits 2, 3; TR 17; 21-25, 44-46)    \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSpecial circumstances contributed to his failure to resolve these credit card \ndebts.  \n \n\u2022 For the1995 to 2002 period when he was in school, they lived on his wife\u2019s \nincome of $20,000 per year.  For some on the time he charged his tuition \nof approximately $20,000 to $25,000 to credit cards. While he had \nintended to pay off these credit cards which helped him pay his school \ntuition after he graduated, it took longer for him to find a job than he \nanticipated.  Thus, he was financially unable to pay the debts in 2002.  \n(TR 27, 41-43, 63) \n \n\u2022 Later his daughter\u2019s son had a malignant brain tumor, so in 2002 Applicant \nmoved from State #2 to the area where she lived (State #1) in order to \nprovide her support and assistance.  He got a job in State #1 so that his \nwife could take care of his daughter\u2019s infant child and the ill child.  (TR 26-\n27, 41-43)  \n \n\u2022 In 2003 he was fired from a job from not learning it fast enough which also \nadversely affected his ability to repay his debts.  (Exhibit 1; TR 63-64)  \n \n\u2022 Recently, his wife has not been able to work because of health problems; \nshe has had two and a half years of recovering from various surgeries.  \n(TR 51)  She began working again as a babysitter for her daughter in \nJanuary 2008, but makes a modest income.  (Exhibit A) \n \nAt the time of the hearing he had no formal budget to present as his wife handles \ntheir finances.  (TR 24-25)  He earns $50,000 annually since he was promoted in \nAugust 2007, a raise from his initial salary of $44,000.  (TR 32, 49-50)   \n \nApplicant reported his take home pay of approximately $2,800 per month. (TR \n50-51)  In addition, his mother is giving them $11,000 per year under the Gift Act.  (TR \n52)  His expenses include rent of approximately $1,600 per month.  He owns a home in \nState #2 worth approximately $200,000, but does not have to make any mortgage \npayments as the mortgage is paid.  He owns a 1996 car and a 1997 car that are paid \nfor. He also owns a classic car valued at about $30,000.  (TR 52-56) He has other \nassets and is current on his taxes.  (TR 56- 59) \n \nHe provided a monthly budget that reported that he earned monthly net income \nof approximately $2,800 per month. His wife now earns $711 net per month; and he \nallocated $916 of the gift money from his mother to his monthly income for a monthly \ntotal of $4,442.  He documented expenses of almost $3,600 for his homes in States #1 \nand #2.  He thus had a net remainder of approximately $850 per month.  (Exhibits A, C) \n \nReferences \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s two supervisors favorably evaluated him. (Exhibits B, C) \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n            Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in \nevaluating an individual's security eligibility which are divided into conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns.  In deciding whether to grant or continue an individual's access to \nclassified information, the mere presence or absence of any adjudication policy \ncondition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the evidence as a whole in \nevaluating this case, I weighed the relevant Revised Adjudication Guidelines, and \ndetermined the following security concern was relevant to my determination: \n \nGuideline F:  Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern caused by financial problems is: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation.  \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial \ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \n \nAG \u00b6 18. \n \n            The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to \ndemonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \napplicant's access to classified information. Then the applicant may present evidence to \nrefute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order to overcome the doubts raised by the \nGovernment, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue the clearance.  Under the provisions of Executive \nOrder 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an \napplicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do \nso is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial \noverall common sense determination, the Administrative Judge may draw only those \ninferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of \nrecord.   \n \n            Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security \nclearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an \nindividual a security clearance is not a decision on the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nof an applicant.3 An adverse decision reflects that an applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nsecurity clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n      \n            The government provided substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nreflecting debts totaling approximately $40,000, so Financial Considerations \nDisqualifying Condition, AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \n\u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  His financial problems are \nsufficiently significant to raise security concerns. \n \n            With the government\u2019s case initially established, the burden shifted to Applicant \nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case \nagainst him.   Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and, \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(a) partially applies because several of his financial problems \u201coccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d His debts grew out of \n \n     3Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nhis school tuition and living expenses when he was in school for and lived on his wife\u2019s \n$20,000 annual income.  He subsequently had to move to a new area with higher \nexpenses.  While he negotiated a settlement for one of his debts, he believes he owes \nnothing on the other debts as the creditors have written off those debts.  He does not \nreceive full credit under AG \u00b6 20(a) because not all of his debts grew out of special \ncircumstances and because of his unwillingness and slowness in addressing the debts \nwritten off by Creditors #1, #2, and #3.   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) provides that security concerns may be mitigated when, \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., \nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, \ndivorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d \nHe was unemployed from June 1995 to October 2002 when he was in school and lived \non his wife\u2019s limited income.  Applicant and his wife moved to State #1 to assist her \ndaughter when her son was gravely ill. He was again unemployed from January to April \n2003. More recently his wife has been ill and unable to work because of several \nsurgeries.   He receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) as his inability to resolve some \nof the debts were from conditions beyond his control due to special circumstances and \nhis limited income.   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies.  Although Applicant did not seek financial counseling, there \nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control as he has \ndeveloped a plan to resolve his debts.  One SOR debt was paid through a settlement.  \nWith an accounting degree Applicant has concluded he does not have to pay back \ndebts that have been written off by creditors; he has been unwilling to file for \nbankruptcy.  He has substantial additional resources as he receives a $11,000 tax-free \nannual gift from his mother.  While Department Counsel challenged his including this gift \nin his monthly assets, his monthly allocation of this gift into the income side of his ledger \nis fair and reasonable.  In addition he has substantial assets that he could utilize for \nfinancial emergencies.  He no longer uses any credit cards and has not developed any \nnew debt in the past five years.  Thus, I conclude that he has responsibly demonstrated \nhis financial problems are under control. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) partially applies because Applicant made a good-faith effort to repay one \noverdue creditor to resolve that debt through a settlement.  However, due to special \ncircumstances discussed above, he did not have additional resources to resolve the \nother debts.  However, the creditors made no effort to bring judgments against him or \ntake timely actions to collect; therefore, I conclude his debts (SOR \u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c) \nmay have been barred by Pennsylvania\u2019s 4-year statute of limitations.1 \n \n1 See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5525 (2007).  For example, the South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the \nsocietal and judicial value of application of the statute of limitations: \n \nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they stimulate \nactivity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and stability to human affairs.  \nThe cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of law \nto promote and achieve finality in litigation.  Significantly, statutes of limitations provide potential \ndefendants with certainty that after a set period of time, they will not be ha[iled] into court to \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n AG \u00b6 20(e) does apply as Applicant did \u201cdispute the legitimacy\u201d of three of the \npast-due debt \u201cwhich is the cause of the problem\u201d because he considers them resolved \nsince the companies no longer are attempting to collect these written off debts from him \nwhich are no doubt barred from collection do to a state statute of limitations.  As \ndiscussed above, a state statute of limitations on the collection of these debts has a \nlaudable goal as they discourage people from sitting on their rights as these three \ncreditors have done. \n \nWhole Person Analysis \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties have in part grown out of his noteworthy desire to \nattend college to get a degree while he had inadequate financial resources.  Further, his \ninability to timely resolve the credit card debts resulted in part from his exemplary efforts \nto help his family through difficult circumstances.  Both Applicant and his wife are now \nfull time workers, who have a budget. Applicant has taken significant steps to move \nahead on the road to financial recovery and has recently been promoted to a more \nhighly paid position. He is highly regarded by his supervisors.  \n \nHaving considered both the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d \nconcept, I conclude he is a sincere person who made substantial efforts to reform his \nfinancial practices.  There is little potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress \nbecause of his stable employment and his substantial assets.  \n \nIn conclusion, financial issues no longer remain a security concern as he has \nlived within his means for the past five years. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude he has mitigated the security concerns pertaining to financial \nconsiderations.  I rule For Applicant in subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d.  \n \n            After reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process \nsection, I make the following formal findings: \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \ndefend time-barred claims.  Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on \ntheir rights.  Statutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system. \n  \n \nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C. Ct. App. 2005) (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted). The reduction in the magnitude and number of debts that creditors can \nlegally enforce because of the application of the Texas statute of limitations reduces the potential vulnerability to \nimproper financial inducements, and the degree that a debtor is \u201cfinancially overextended,\u201d is also reduced. \nHowever, it does not negate the debtor\u2019s past conduct, which failed to take more aggressive actions to resolve the \nfinancial jeopardy.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline F:                                       FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.:                             For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n            In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the \nApplicant.

In 2008 he made two statements, in which he denied that he used his \ngovernment computer to view pornography. Applicant mitigated the security concern \nabout his misuse of a government information technology system because this misuse \nwas not recent and is unlikely to recur. However, he failed to mitigate personal conduct \nsecurity concerns related to making false statements in 2008. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 7, 2005, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On March 12, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \nJune 22, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and \nM (Use of Information Technology Systems). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether \nApplicant\u2019s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn March 23, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge (GE 7). Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on May 5, 2009. On May 7, 2009, the case was assigned to an administrative \njudge. On May 13, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (GE 5). Due to a family \nemergency, the case was transferred to me on June 2, 2009 (Transcript (Tr.) 4-5). The \nhearing was held on June 3, 2009. Department Counsel offered four exhibits (GE 1-4) \n(Tr. 20-21), and Applicant offered two exhibits (Tr. 23-25, 40-41; Applicant Exhibits (AE) \nA-B). There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-4 (Tr. 21) and AE A-B (Tr. 25-26, \n41). Additionally, I admitted the Notice of Hearing, SOR, and response to the SOR (GE \n5-7). I received the transcript on June 11, 2009.    \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR \nallegations, except he expressed some skepticism about the number of pornographic \nimages found on his computer and the number of government computers found to \ncontain pornographic images (GE 7). His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following \nfindings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is between 70 and 80 years old (Tr. 6). He graduated from a service \nacademy about 50 years ago (Tr. 26). He served on active duty for about 35 years and \nretired in the 1990s (Tr. 26). His retirement grade was at the two-star level. His \nretirement award was the Distinguished Service Medal (AE A at 8). The service chief in \nApplicant\u2019s branch of service presided at his retirement ceremony (AE A at 8). During \nhis career, he received eight Legion of Merit Medals (GE A at 9). He commanded a vast \norganization with enormous fire power, including nuclear weapons (GE A at 9-10). He \nsupervised a budget of over $2 billion (AE A at 7). He has had an extraordinary career \nof service and made tremendous contributions to the national defense of the United \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy because this \ndecision after minimal redaction will be posted on the internet. Specific information is available in the cited \ntranscript and exhibits. \n  \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nStates (AE A). At various times during his career, Applicant has held a top secret \nclearance with access to sensitive compartmented information (Tr. 36; AE A). \n \nApplicant has been married for more than 40 years. He has several children and \ngrandchildren (Tr. 26-27; AE B at 3). After retirement from active service, he worked for \na defense contractor in relation to foreign military sales (Tr. 28). In the 1990s, he \nworked at a very high level in the government, in an extremely sensitive position for \nabout a year, and then returned to the private sector (Tr. 28). He currently works as a \nconsultant to the government, as a program manager for an entity that is closely \nassociated with the government, and is on the board of directors for a government \ncontractor (Tr. 29-31).    \n  \nMisuse of government computers2 \n \nFor about one year in the 1990s, Applicant was employed in an extremely \nsensitive government position. Use of his government computer while on duty to view \nimages of adults engaged in pornographic activities, while occupying this position, \nwould cast significant discredit upon the Department of Defense and it violates rules in \nhis workplace about use of his government computer and on-duty Internet use.  \n \nIn the 1990s, while employed in this sensitive position, Applicant noticed his \ncomputer was operating slowly or had difficulties with its dial-up connection. Applicant \nasked computer maintenance to take corrective action. Maintenance replaced his \ncomputer with another government computer. Maintenance personnel discovered \nnumerous Graphics Interface Format (.gif) files depicting individuals involved in sexual \nactivity. Forensic computer analysts found 379 graphic images of adults engaged in \npornographic activities on one hard drive (ROI \u00b6 3-9). About a month later, investigators \nobtained the hard drive from his replacement computer and discovered 210 graphic \nimages of adult pornography (ROI \u00b6 3-6). A total of about 80 files found on the two hard \ndrives were recovered from deleted files. The forensic examination of the two hard \ndrives did not indicate how many files were automatically saved by the computer in \ntemporary files and whether any files discovered on his computer were deliberately \nsaved by Applicant and placed into folders for subsequent viewing.3   \n \nTwo images found on his hard drive depicted nude prepubescent adolescents \n(ROI \u00b6 3-16a). One of the images was of very poor quality. Applicant denied that he had \nsearched the internet for any child pornography (Tr. 39). He denied knowingly opening \n \n2 Unless stated otherwise, the facts in this section are from a Report of Investigation (ROI) \ncompleted in the 1990s (Applicant was titled as the SUBJECT of the investigation) (GE 2). \n \n3 It is possible from the way the ROI was written that three computer hard drives were forensically \nexamined and about 800 images of adult pornography were found (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.c). The more credible \ninterpretation is that the government evaluated two computer hard drives and found 500-600 images of \npornography. Applicant thought the number of images alleged in the SOR might be an exaggeration; \nhowever, he conceded whether it was 500 images or 800 images was not a significant issue (Tr. 60-61; \nGE 7).  \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nany .gif files showing child pornography (Tr. 39). He denied that he had any sexual \ninterest whatsoever in children or viewing nude or sexual images of children (Tr. 39). \n \nThe military investigators turned the investigation was turned over to the Federal \nBureau of Investigation after he ended his federal employment in the late 1990s. \nApplicant was never questioned or confronted about misuse of his government \ncomputer (ROI \u00b6 3-32 and ROI cover letter; Tr. 45). Applicant was not advised of the \nexistence of the investigation until 2009. Applicant told his spouse about the \ninvestigation shortly after he was advised of its results (Tr. 59).  \n \nAfter leaving government service in the 1990s, Applicant occasionally viewed \npornography (Tr. 60). He described his contact with internet pornography over the last \nten years as \u201cinfrequent\u201d (Tr. 60). Applicant downloaded and viewed some images of \nadults engaged in pornographic activities while on duty at his government place of \nemployment.  \n   \nFalsification of security clearance related documentation \n \nOn April 28, 2008, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator \nquestioned Applicant about his misuse of a government computer to search for and look \nat pornographic material (Tr. 49). Applicant orally responded, \u201cno, certainly not,\u201d when \nhe was confronted with the allegations (Tr. 49). Applicant provided an affidavit, which \nstates, \u201cI never misused a government computer and do not view child pornography\u201d \n(GE 3). Applicant signed the statement and knew the part about denying that he viewed \nimages of adults engaged in pornographic activities was not true at the time he made \nthis statement (Tr. 53-54).  \n \nOn September 25, 2008, Applicant responded to a DOHA interrogatory, \u201cTo my \nknowledge I have not used any work computer to view pornographic material at [my \ngovernment office]. In fact, I have thought all such computers blocked access to such \nsites. If I did so, it must have been very isolated as I don\u2019t have time to surf the Internet \nin any of my jobs.\u201d (Tr. 52-53; GE 4). Applicant signed this statement and knew it was \nnot true at the time he made this statement (Tr. 56-58).  \n \nAt his hearing Applicant stated, \u201cWhen I was presented with the first round of \nthese allegations, I hotly and falsely denied same, both orally and subsequently, \nmeaning later, on in the hour, in a statement that I submitted to the government \nrepresentative\u201d (Tr. 42).  He vigorously denied that he viewed images of adults engaged \nin pornographic activities to the OPM investigator. At his hearing, he described himself \nas being \u201cblatantly\u201d untruthful when he denied viewing images of adults engaged in \npornographic activities (Tr. 50-51). Applicant had extraordinary regret about his actions \n(Tr. 56). He acknowledged in his SOR response and reiterated at his hearing that his \nresponses to the OPM investigator and to the DOHA interrogatory were false in regard \nto his claim that he did not view images of adults engaged in pornographic activities on \nhis government computer (Tr. 58). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApplicant conceded that the government should have a higher expectation of \nhonesty and integrity for him because of his age and experience (Tr. 45). He \nemphasized that he did not knowingly view any child pornography and he did not recall \never seeing the two images of child pornography cited in the ROI (AE B at 2).4  He \ndescribed his mental state in 2008 when he denied viewing images of adults engaged in \npornographic activities on his government computer as \u201ca combination of haughtiness, \nfear and embarrassment.\u201d (AE B at 2). \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \n \n4 The SOR did not allege that he viewed or possessed any images of child pornography (GE 6).  \nThe only information about the two images of child pornography was contained in the ROI (GE 2). \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and M (Use of Information \nTechnology Systems).  \n  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nOn April 28, 2008, Applicant falsely denied using his government computer to \nview images of adults engaged in pornographic activities to an OPM investigator and on \nSeptember 25, 2008, he reiterated this false denial in response to DOHA \ninterrogatories. However, he admitted in his SOR response and at his hearing that his \nanswers on these two previous occasions about viewing images of adults engaged in \npornographic activities were false. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) both apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. The falsification is established. He \nadmitted that he deliberately and intentionally provided false information on two \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \noccasions when he denied that he viewed images of adults engaged in pornographic \nactivities in the context of a review to decide whether his security clearance should be \ncontinued.5 \n    \nUse of Information Technology Systems \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 39 articulates the security concern relating to misuse of information \ntechnology systems: \n \nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology Systems include all related \ncomputer hardware, software, firmware, and data used for the \ncommunication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or \nprotection of information. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 40(e) and 40(f) detail two conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case. AG 40(e) states, \u201cunauthorized use of a \ngovernment or other information technology system,\u201d and AG \u00b6 40(f) provides, \n\u201cintroduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or media to or \nfrom any information technology system without authorization, when prohibited by rules, \nprocedures, guidelines or regulations.\u201d Applicant was well aware that he was not \nauthorized to use a government computer to access and download files depicting \npornographic images onto his government computer. By viewing .gif files on Internet \nsites showing images of adults engaged in pornographic activities, he automatically \ndownloaded or introduced those media-images or .gif files onto his computer hard drive. \nAs such, his introduction of those images onto his computer was probably unintentional \nbecause he was not aware that they would be automatically downloaded onto his \ncomputer. However, other pornographic .gif files were evidently intentionally saved or \nintroduced onto his computer hard drive and then subsequently deleted from his \ncomputer hard drive. The forensic investigator then recovered the deleted .gif files, \nestablishing by substantial evidence their previous intentional, unauthorized introduction \n \n5The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). In this case, Applicant did not contest the allegations of falsification.  \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nonto his computer hard drive. AG \u00b6\u00b6 40(e) and 40(f) both apply and further inquiry and \nanalysis about the applicability of mitigating conditions is necessary.   \n \nAG \u00b6 41 provides three mitigating conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns including: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the misuse was minor and done only in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness, such as letting another person use one's \npassword or computer when no other timely alternative was readily \navailable; and \n \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of \nsupervisor. \n  \nAG \u00b6 41(a) fully applies and AG \u00b6\u00b6 41(b) and 41(c) do not apply.  Applicant \ndownloaded about 500 images of adults engaged in pornographic activities. His conduct \nin going to the sexually-explicit Internet sites, and opening these .gif files was not \naccidental, unintentional or inadvertent. He knew when he double clicked these icons \nthe type of image that would be revealed. This conduct was not done for organizational \nefficiency or effectiveness. He did not admit this conduct until after he was advised that \nhe had been investigated for it. As such, his admissions were not spontaneous.  \n \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s abuse of government computers occurred more than 10 \nyears ago. He does not currently use a government computer, and has not been a \ngovernment employee for at least 10 years. His viewing of adult pornography (which is \nnot connected to his government service as a contractor) is private and infrequent. His \nviewing of images of adults engaged in pornographic activities using his government-\nissued computer, while on duty as a government employee in the 1990s under all the \nfacts and circumstances, \u201cdoes not cast doubt on [his current] reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment.\u201d Security concerns pertaining to use of information technology \nsystems are mitigated. See AG \u00b6 41(a). \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines E and M in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n  \nAlthough the rationale for reinstating Applicant\u2019s clearance is insufficient to \nsupport a security clearance at this time, there are several factors that support approval \nof his clearance. During his active service from the 1950s to the 1990s, he received the \nDistinguished Service Medal and eight Legion of Merit awards. The service chief of \nApplicant\u2019s branch of service presided at his retirement ceremony in the 1990s. \nApplicant deserves substantial credit for volunteering to support his service and the \nDepartment of Defense thereafter for about 50 years. He has served his nation and the \nnational defense extraordinarily well, rising to very high level on active duty and \nsubsequently in a civil capacity. His longevity and success speaks very well for his \ndedication, patriotism and loyalty to the United States, the U.S. government, and his \nemployer. There were no allegations of security violations. He does not abuse alcohol \nor illegal drugs. He made mistakes, and he admitted them in his SOR response and at \nhis hearing. I specifically find his denial of intentionally viewing or ever intending to view \nany child pornography to be credible. His remorse about viewing the adult pornography \non his government computer and about making false statements about that misconduct \nin April and September 2008 is heartfelt and sincere. He has learned from his mistakes \nand I am confident that he will not repeat them. These factors show substantial \nresponsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. \n \nThe whole person factors against reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance are \nmore substantial at this time. Making false statements to an OPM investigator and in \nresponse to a DOHA interrogatory is not prudent or responsible. He had ample \nopportunity between being confronted by the OPM investigator on April 28, 2008, and \nreceipt of the DOHA interrogatories on September 25, 2008, to correct the false \ninformation he provided to the government. Instead on September 25, 2008, he \nsubmitted more false information to the government. Notwithstanding his truly \nextraordinary background and contributions to the nation, his two falsifications are \nrecent, material, and cannot be mitigated at this time.    \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the personal conduct security concerns. I take this position based on the law, \nas set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful \nconsideration of the whole person factors and supporting evidence, my application of \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nthe pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my  \nresponsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has failed to mitigate and/or overcome \nthe government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access \nto classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:    \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: \n Against Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:    \n For Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMARK HARVEY \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on March 3, 2008. The SOR is equivalent to\nan administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues in\nthis case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations and Guideline E for personal\nconduct. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided against Applicant. \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nNovember 25, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR was received by DOHA on July 7, 2008, and he\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on August 22, 2008. The hearing\ntook place as scheduled on September 24, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on\nOctober 2, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges 27 delinquent debts ranging from $26 to\n$12,490 for a total of about $43,000; it also alleges a single incident of theft by check for\nless than $500, to which Applicant pleaded guilty. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges\nthat Applicant gave false answers in response to two questions about his financial\nrecord when he completed a security-clearance application. In his response to the SOR,\nApplicant admitted the Guideline F allegations except for three debts and he denied the\nfalsification allegations. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts\nare established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 36-year-old security officer who works as night-shift supervisor. He\nhas worked for his current employer since July 2006. His employment history includes\nmilitary service in the U.S. Marine Corps that ended with his honorable discharge. \nHis first marriage ended in divorce. He has a son from that marriage and he is\nrequired to pay child support. He remarried in 2001, but he and his second wife have\nbeen separated for about the last four years. He has a second son with a woman with\nwhom he resides.  \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. The delinquent debts alleged in the\nSOR are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the admitted evidence (Exhibits 2,\n3, 4, and 5). To date, Applicant has not paid, settled, or otherwise resolved any of these\ndebts. His general plan to address these debts is that now that his child-support\narrearage has been caught up, he plans to use that money to pay on the debts. \nHe currently earns about $16 per hour. He has no savings, no investment\naccounts, and does not own any real estate. He describes his current financial condition\nas living paycheck-to-paycheck. For example, he was behind on his cell phone bill at the\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

He explained the indebtedness was the result of not having enough money to\npay his expenses (Tr. 28). \nApplicant is seeking to obtain an industrial security clearance for the first time. He\ncompleted a security-clearance application on or about August 22, 2006 (Exhibit 1). He\nwas required to answer various questions about his background, to include his financial\nrecord. He denied having been over 180 days delinquent on any debts during the last\nseven years in response to Question 28a. Likewise, he denied that he was currently\nover 90 days delinquent on any debts in response to Question 28b. During his\nbackground investigation, Applicant acknowledged his delinquent accounts and\nexplained that he did not report the accounts on his security-clearance application\nbecause he was not aware of the accounts (Exhibit 2). He denied any intention to falsify\nany information. He provided a similar explanation during the hearing (Tr. 41). \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n6\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n15\n4\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n14\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n15\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it\n\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n But in this particular case, the single incident of theft by check in 2001 is not sufficient to raise a security\n18\nconcern as a deceptive or illegal financial practice. Accordingly, SOR \u00b6 1.bb is decided for Applicant. \n5\nindicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting\n16\nfinancial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more\n17\nthan sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions.  Likewise, the evidence is\n18\nsufficient to establish financial irresponsibility.\nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns:\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\n \nAll the mitigating conditions have been considered and none apply in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nApplicant did not present sufficient evidence to justify applying any MC. In reaching this\nconclusion, I specifically considered the circumstances of his past divorce and his\ncurrent separation. But Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to show that he\nacted responsibly under the circumstances. It appears that Applicant\u2019s history of\nfinancial problems is largely due to using credit to live beyond his means.   \n\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n19\nconditions).  \n Revised Guidelines at 10.\n20\n Revised Guidelines at 1\u20132 (listing nine factors to consider under the whole-person concept). \n21\n Revised Guidelines at 2 (\u201cthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence\u201d). \n22\n6\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and\n19\ncredible adverse information that may not be enough to support action under any other\nguideline. In particular, a security concern may arise due to:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n20\nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An\nomission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely\nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely\nthought the information did not need to be reported. \nThe issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answers to Questions 28a and\n28b of his security-clearance application. In making this determination, I note that I had\nthe opportunity to listen to his testimony and observe his demeanor. Applicant\u2019s\nexplanation that he was unaware of the accounts is credible, as it appears that the\ndelinquent accounts were largely out-of-sight and out-of-mind. I am not persuaded that\nApplicant gave deliberately false answers in response to these two questions.\nAccordingly, Guideline E is decided for Applicant. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F. Applicant did not meet his ultimate\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this\nconclusion, the whole-person concept  was given due consideration and that analysis\n21\ndoes not support a favorable decision. Indeed, looking forward to the next 12 to 18\nmonths, it is highly unlikely that he will successfully resolve his financial problems.  This\n22\ncase is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n7\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.aa:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.bb:\nFor Applicant \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.  \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Murphy, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted. \n \nOn January 8, 2007, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (e-\nQIP). On December 3, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nF (Financial Considerations), to Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 19, 2007, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On February 14, 2008, DOHA assigned the \nApril 17, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \ncase to me. A Notice of Hearing issued on February 29, 2008, and the case was heard \non March 19, 2008, as scheduled.  Department Counsel offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n4 into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A through \nF into evidence without objection.  At the conclusions of the hearing, I left the record \nopen until March 28, 2008, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional \ninformation. On that day, Applicant submitted three exhibits that were marked as AE G, \nH and I, and were admitted into the record without objection by the Government. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript on March 28, 2008.                                                           \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all factual allegations contained in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.m, 1.o through 1.v, 1.x through 1.cc, and 1.ee of the SOR. He denied \nthose contained in \u00b6\u00b6 1.n, 1.w, 1.dd, and 1.ii of the SOR. He provided additional \ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 45 years old and married. He and his wife have two adult children \nand three grandchildren.  In 1974, he graduated from college with a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin finance. In 1982, he earned a master\u2019s degree in public administration with an \nemphasis in government finance. He was commissioned in the U.S. Air Force in 1974. \nHe held a top-secret clearance from the time he entered military service until he left with \nan honorable discharge in 1986. (Tr. 71). After leaving the Air Force, he began working \nfor a federal defense contractor in August 1986 that provided financial services to the \narmed forces.  As he no longer needed a top-secret clearance, it converted into a secret \nclearance. (Tr. 72). There is no evidence that he was involved in any security clearance \nviolations during the thirty or more years he held a clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife began experiencing serious medical problems in 1991 when  her \nheart valves were replaced. In 1997, she had two transient ischemic attacks (mini-\nstrokes). In February 2000, she suffered a brain hemorrhage and in July 2000, she \nexperienced an acute respiratory disease. Subsequent to those medical problems, \nApplicant began having financial difficulties, as he was working away from home and \nmaintaining two households. In July 2004, his wife had a debilitating stroke. (AE A; GE \n4 at 14; Tr. 34-36; 66-67). He then took 16 weeks of leave pursuant to the Family \nMedical Leave Act (FMLA) to care for his wife. After extinguishing that benefit, Applicant \nleft his employer to continue caring for his wife from March 2005 through September \n2006. Because he did not have funds to pay his monthly expenses during that period of \nunemployment, he withdrew monies from his 401(k) plan to cover the costs. (Tr. 21; GE \n4 at 14).  Based on his retirement funds and his wife\u2019s lack of payments into social \nsecurity, she is not eligible for disability.  (Tr. 47; 67). \n \n \nAfter returning to work in October 2006, Applicant\u2019s employer assigned him to \nshort-term projects that did not require a security clearance. (Tr. 30; AE C). (During that \nmonth, his wife broke her hip, resulting in additional medical bills.) He completed his last \nassignment in November 2007 and in January 2008.  His employer terminated him, \npending the issuance of a security clearance. Over the past 36 months, (approximately \n\n \n3 \n \n \nbetween August, 2004 to November 2007) he has been unemployed at least 20 \nmonths. (Tr. 22). \n \n \nThe SOR alleges security concerns based on financial considerations, involving \napproximately $49,363 of delinquent debt, plus $18,000 of medical bills.1  Applicant \nnegotiated some of the debt with creditors. (Tr. 26-27; AE E). He acknowledges that he \nowes approximately $16,087 in credit card debt and other expenses, in addition to \n$18,000 in medical bills. He currently owes about $15,000 in income taxes, most of \nwhich resulted from the early withdrawal of retirement funds.2 (Tr. 24). All of that debt \nremains outstanding, except for the taxes, on which he is making monthly payments. \n(AE D and E; Tr. 31; 61).    \n \n \nAlthough Applicant has not sought credit counseling, in October 2007 he \nsubmitted a detailed spreadsheet, itemizing all of his debts and expenses for the prior \nsix months.3 (GE 4 at 16-17). He was not incurring any additional expenses at the time \nhe established the spreadsheet and estimated his income to debt ration to be 16%, \nbased on his previous salary. He also noted that 40% of his income is spent on his \nwife\u2019s medical care.  Given his calculations, he projected that he would be able to pay \nall of his debts by the end of 2012, if he continued earning the same salary he was \nearning at the time he drafted the budget.  \n \n \nOn March 27, 2008, Applicant submitted a revised budget, along with a debt \nrepayment plan, projecting that he would be able to pay off all of his bills, including his \nwife\u2019s additional medical bills, by 2013, should he resume his prior job and salary in the \nnear future. (AE G). His estimated expenses are about $4,600 per month, plus an \nadditional $1,000 for medical insurance that is not presently covered by an employer. \nHis previous monthly net income was about $4,600 and essentially covered ordinary \nexpenses and his debt reduction plan. He is not incurring additional expenses and does \nnot use credit cards. (Tr. 58). He acknowledged that it is difficult to negotiate \nsettlements with some creditors without a steady income. (Tr. 28-32). \n \n \nCurrently, Applicant continues to withdraw monies monthly from his 401(k) to pay \nhis expenses while pursuing employment. Although he would like to maintain his \nposition with his federal employer, he recently began looking for work in the private \nsector, as he is anxious to return to work. (Tr. 65-66). He understands that delinquent \ndebt may raise security clearance issues; however, in this instance, he attributes his \nfinancial problems to his wife\u2019s medical expenses and a lack of employment over a long \nperiod of time while caring for her. He emphasized that he never experienced financial \nproblems until 2000. (Tr. 67).  \n                                                          \n1Many of the medical bills included in the aggregate $18, 0000 amount listed in SOR \u00b61.ii are also listed \nseparately in various subparagraphs of the SOR. Hence, there appears to be a duplication of the debts. \n(Tr. 29).  \n2 The SOR alleged that he owed about $16,500 in unpaid taxes, but he has since made payments on that \namount. (AE D & F). \n3 Applicant has a financial degree and background in \u201ccost estimating as well as business process \nanalysis, economic analysis, and cost benefits.\u201d (Tr. 64). He routinely establishes and oversees budgets \nfor clients, including the federal government.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated a significant amount of delinquent debt \nattributable to his wife\u2019s medical complications that he has been unable to manage \nsince 2000 due to long periods of unemployment. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifications, \nthe burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. \nThe guideline includes six conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated \nwhen Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial worries arose \naround 2000 and continue into 2007. Because the problems are ongoing for various \nreasons, this condition cannot apply.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s his debts \naccumulated as a result of his wife\u2019s serious medical conditions that began in 1991 and \nworsened in 2000 and 2004. Those circumstances were outside of his control. He \npresented some evidence indicating that he attempted to manage his debts by \nwithdrawing monies from his retirement funds. I find this potentially mitigating condition \nhas partial application in this case.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.@ Although Applicant did not present evidence that he obtained \nformal credit counseling, he established two detailed budgets, exhibiting his extensive \nknowledge of budget analysis, which project resolution of the problems within four years \nof obtaining employment. He provided evidence that he reduced some of the debt \nthrough negotiation with his creditors and established a monthly repayment plan for his \ntaxes. I conclude these mitigating conditions should be given some consideration. \n \nApplicant disputed a couple debts, but did not provide documentation to \nsubstantiate his claim, as required under AG \u00b6 20(e).  There is no evidence to support \nthe application of AG \u00b6 20(f).   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following: (1) the \nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a 45-year-old man, who \nhonorably served his country for twelve years in the military service, during which time \nhe held a Top-Secret clearance. After leaving military service, he began employment \nwith a federal contractor and continued successfully supporting the armed forces, while \nmaintaining a Secret security clearance for another twenty years.  \n  \nIn 2000, Applicant\u2019s wife began experiencing serious medical problems, which \nplaced a significant strain on the household budget. In July 2004, her problems \nintensified and ultimately resulted in an extended period of unemployment for him, while \nhe cared for her and relied on 401(k) contributions for financial support. Subsequently, \nhe has continued to pursue employment within the government and in the private \nsector. He credibly acknowledged his debts and expressed a desire to resolve them. \nPrior to this series of misfortunes, he had not experienced financial difficulties. Given his \nsophisticated knowledge and experience in financial management, and his current \nbudget in which he is resolving his tax debt with limited income, I do not believe similar \nfinancial problems will recur while he seeks employment or after he obtains full-time \nemployment. The Appeal Board noted in ISCR Case No. 06-12930, \u201cthat an applicant is \n\n \n7 \n \n \nnot required to show that she has completely paid off her indebtedness, only that she \nhas established a reasonable plan to resolve her debts and has taken \u2018significant \nactions to implement that plan.\u2019 ISCR Case No.04-09684 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul.6, 2006).\u2019\u201d \nIn this case, Applicant has taken steps to pursue employment. Once he obtains a job, \nhe will be able to pay the delinquent debts in accordance with his detailed budget and \nprojected time line for resolving his financial obligations. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant is an intelligent \nhardworking individual, who has experienced a series of unanticipated difficulties that \nhave seriously affected his financial life. There is no evidence in his background to \nindicate that his financial problems may create a security risk. For all these reasons, I \nconclude \nApplicant \nmitigated \nthe \nsecurity \nconcerns \narising \nunder \nfinancial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.ii:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following 2 findings of fact: Applicant is a 42-year-old woman who had been employed by a defense contractor for about six years at the time she submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) in December 2004. She was born in Kenya, is a citizen of the United Kingdom, and became a naturalized United States citizen in November 2004. She did not possess a U.S. passport at the time she submitted the SF 86. Applicant possesses a U.K. passport that was issued in October 2001, and which does not expire until October 2011.

Applicant submitted a response to the SOR,\nsigned by her on November 23, 2007, in which she admitted all SOR allegations and\nrequested a clearance decision based on the written record without a hearing.  \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on December 6,\n2007, which was mailed to Applicant on December 11, 2007, and received by her on\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nMarch 28, 2008\n\n In addition to the pleadings, the FORM consists of a security clearance application (SF 86) executed\n2\nby Applicant on December 20, 2004, brief responses to interrogatories executed by Applicant on August 29,\n2007, and a copy of her United Kingdom passport. Thus, very little is known about Applicant and what is\nknown is based on information that is over three years old and which may or may not still be accurate.\nHowever, because neither side requested a hearing, my findings in this case must be based on the meager\nand stale information contained in the FORM.  \n2\nDecember 14, 2007. Applicant was informed she had 30 days from receipt of the FORM\nto submit her objections to information contained in the FORM or submit any material she\nwished to be considered.

In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits,  I make the following\n2\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is a 42-year-old woman who had been employed by a defense contractor\nfor about six years at the time she submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) in\nDecember 2004. She was born in Kenya, is a citizen of the United Kingdom, and became\na naturalized United States citizen in November 2004. She did not possess a U.S. passport\nat the time she submitted the SF 86. \nApplicant possesses a U.K. passport that was issued in October 2001, and which\ndoes not expire until October 2011. In her August 2007 response to interrogatories,\nApplicant provided the following reason why she was unwilling to destroy, surrender, or\ninvalidate her U.K. passport: \n\u201cI wish to keep my British citizenship current until my daughters are adults\nand are able to decided at that time if they wish to retain or renounce their\nBritish citizenship.\u201d (FORM Item 6) \nThe FORM does not disclose when Applicant immigrated to the U.K. from Kenya.\nHowever, she attended a technical college in the U.K. from September 1984 until May\n1986, and thereafter worked for the British government as an administrative assistant from\nMay 1987 until July 1998. Applicant\u2019s mother was born in Kenya, resides in the U.S., and\nis a dual U.S. and U.K. citizen. Applicant\u2019s father was born in India but is now a resident\nand citizen of the U.K.\nApplicant was married in the U.K. in September 1997. Her husband was born in\nKenya, resides with her in the U.S., and is a U.K. She has a 17-year-old daughter who born\nin the U.K., resides with her, and is a U.K. citizen. Applicant also has an eight-year-old\ndaughter who was born in the U.S., resides with her, and is a dual U.S. and U.K. citizen.\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law were born in India but are now residents\nand citizens of the U.K. She has three sisters who were born in Kenya. Two of her sisters\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n6\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n3\nlive in the U.S. One of those two sisters is a U.K. citizen with registered alien status in the\nU.S. The other sister is a dual U.S. and U.K. citizen. Applicant\u2019s third sister is a U.K. citizen\nbut resides in Qatar.  \nApplicant owns a house in the U.K. that was her marital residence before she\nrelocated to the U.S. She rents the house, valued at approximately $250,000, to tenants.\nApplicant visited the U.K. for about two weeks in 2003. She used her U.K. passport for that\ntravel.  \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline C (foreign preference),\nwith its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n6\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n7\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n10\n Id at 531.\n11\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n12\n4\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nForeign preference is a concern because when an individual acts in such a way as\nto indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may\nbe prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the\nUnited States.\nApplicant possesses a current U.K. passport which she is unwilling to relinquish or\notherwise invalidate because she wants to make certain her daughters can assert their\nBritish citizenship, if they so choose, when they become adults. Disqualifying Condition\n(DC) 10(a): exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes\nbut is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport applies. \nThe FORM is devoid of any information about why Applicant decided to immigrate\nto the U.S., or when or why her family emigrated from Kenya to the U.K. There is no\ninformation available about her future residency plans. Little is known about her husband,\nchildren, parents, siblings, and in-laws. With the exception of her youngest daughter,\nApplicant\u2019s relatives all have ties to one or more foreign countries. For unknown reasons,\none of her sisters resides in Qatar, and what she and her husband, if she is married, do\nthere is also unknown. Applicant previously worked for the British government and she has\nchosen to retain ownership of her former marital residence located in the U.K., again for\nunknown reasons. She has recently and very clearly indicated she wants to leave open the\nopportunity for her children to avail themselves of the rights of British citizenship when they\nbecome adults. \nBecause neither party chose to request a hearing in this case, little, if any, current\ninformation is available upon which a decision can be based and a finding made that\nApplicant has refuted, extenuated, or mitigated the foreign preference concerns alleged\nby the Government. Thus, I am compelled to find no mitigating condition exists and that\nApplicant has failed to mitigate the foreign preference security concern.    \n  \n\n5\nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be\n\u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d There is absolutely no reason to doubt that Applicant is a loyal\nAmerican citizen or suspect she would ever consider doing harm to the interests of the\nUnited States.\n \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe very little information available upon which to base a whole person analysis, the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying condition,\nApplicant has failed to mitigate the foreign preference security concern that exists in this\ncase. She has failed to overcome the case against her in this regard or satisfy her ultimate\nburden of persuasion. Guideline C is decided against Applicant. It is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-e:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\u2019s four siblings are citizens and residents of Iraq. For 14 \nmonths, he acted as an interpreter for U.S. forces in Iraq. After a thorough review of the \ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and evidence, I conclude Applicant has rebutted or \nmitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline B, foreign influence. \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n1\nApril 3, 2008\n\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on October 27, 2007, detailing security concerns under \nForeign Influence.  \n  \n \nOn November 17, 2008, Applicant\u2019s answered the SOR in which Applicant \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. On January 15, 2007, I was \nassigned the case. On February 11, 2008, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling \nthe hearing held on February 20, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1and 2, \nwhich were admitted into evidence. Applicant and two witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s \nbehalf and he submitted Exhibits A through H, which were admitted into evidence. On \nMarch 11, 2008, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nrelating to Iraq.

The \nNotice of Hearing was sent out on February 11th for a February 20th hearing. Applicant \nstated he was ready to proceed and did not need additional time to prepare for the \nhearing. (Tr. 10-11)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanations the factual \nallegations in \u00b6 \u00b61.a, 1.b, and 1.c. He also provided additional information to support his \nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old translator who starting working for a defense contractor \nin October 20, 2004. Since November 2007, he has been with his current employer as a \ncultural advisor providing training to U.S. troops, and is seeking to maintain a security \nclearance. (Ex. B, Tr. 39, 40) \n \nApplicant grew up in the middle part of Iraq. In 1986, Applicant\u2019s father, a school \nteacher, was executed by the Saddam Hussein regime. His father had spoken out \nagainst the brutal former regime. (Tr. 26, 89) Applicant was treated as a second class \ncitizen from elementary school through college. Applicant\u2019s mistreatment followed his \nfather\u2019s execution. The Hussein government had confiscated all of his family possession \nand made his family members dependent on the money sent to them.  \n \nApplicant attended university for a couple of years and was then forced to join \nthe \u201ccultural college.\u201d If a family member had been executed children or members of the \n \n2\n\nfamily were not allowed to become a teacher, doctor, or engineer. (Tr. 27) In 1991, \nApplicant\u2014then age 20\u2014was a student in the culture college when he joined the \nuprising against Saddam Hussein. His group rose up to take control of government and \nparty buildings. (Tr. 28) Applicant is the only member of his group to survive. The others \nwere killed in the streets. (Tr. 28) When that uprising failed, Applicant and his brother, \nwho had also participated in the uprising, were chased by the Iraqi Republican guard to \nthe Iraqi boarder. (Tr. 21) His brother was wounded in the leg. At the time of the \nuprising, the Iraq government determined those who rose up against the Hussein \nregime were no longer Iraqi citizens. (Tr. 49)  \n \nApplicant and his brother were placed in a refugees\u2019 camp on the Iraqi-Saudi \nborder. While in camp, they did volunteer work with the United Nations high command \nfor refugees and with the Americans doing translation. (Tr. 90) After 14 months, \nApplicant and his brother received political asylum and were granted access to the U.S. \nOn August 7, 1992, Applicant arrived in the U.S. (Ex. D, Tr. 31) \n \nOnce in the U.S., Applicant accepted any available job and applied for college \nadmission. In 1996, he started attending university part time as his English improved. \n(Tr. 32) Later, Applicant was full-time employed while pursing full-time higher education. \nApplicant helped his family in Iraq overcome the consequences of the international \neconomic embargo and the former regime\u2019s bias against his family. Applicant\u2019s family \nwas classified as Class Z citizens because their father were executed and two sons fled \nthe country to live in the U.S. (Tr. 107) The former regime punished his family because \nApplicant and his brother had fled the country. (Tr. 27)  \n \nIn 2002, Applicant earned his B.S. in pharmacy.  On January 9, 2004, he became \na U.S. citizen. (Ex. E) He considers the day he became a U.S. citizen his birthday. (Tr. \n34) He feels he is part of the U.S. His U.S. passport was issued on January 13, 2004. \n(Ex. G, Tr. 50) He never had an Iraqi passport. (Tr. 49) \n \nPrior to 2003, Applicant applied at numerous U.S. government agencies offering \nhis linguistic skills. He was hired by a defense contractor as a linguist and deployed to \nIraq in December 2004. (Tr. 36) He spent 14 months with U.S. special forces as part of \nan assault team. (Tr. 25, 70) Except for a three-week vacation in the U.S. in July 2005, \nApplicant was in Iraq from December 2004 through February 2006. (Tr. 37) Applicant \ndaily dealt with classified documents and the unit\u2019s secrets of counter terrorism \nprocedures. He was involved in locating and obtaining the release of an American \ncivilian hostage. (Tr. 48)  \n \nApplicant worked with U.S. ground forces in direct contact with enemy forces. He \nworked long hours in austere conditions with an ever present risk of hostile fire. \nApplicant has received numerous letters of recommendation due to his work in Iraq. \nApplicant was adept at operating in dangerous and fluid environments and was \nsuccessful in providing needed information vital to the success of the Task Force\u2019s \nmission. Applicant\u2019s dedication made him an invaluable member of the team and \nprovided his worth on every mission. Applicant is one of the best linguists in the \nbusiness. (Answer to SOR) Applicant provided outstanding service, was always eager \n \n3\n\nto assist, was great to work with, always pleasant to be around, and an invaluable \nasset. His professionalism and work ethic is beyond reproach. (Answer to SOR) He has \nreceived certificates of appreciation for his outstanding performance and lasting \ncontributions greatly enhancing combat readiness. He returned to the U.S. in early \n2006.  \n \nFor one month during August and September 2004, Applicant returned to Iraq to \nvisit his dying mother. He had not seen his mother since March 1991. Applicant left for \nIraq the same day he received the call about his mother\u2019s illness. (Tr. 35) While in Iraq, \nhis mother died. During his stay in Iraq, Applicant missed his apartment and his lifestyle \nin the United States. (Tr. 34)  \n \nApplicant has three brothers and a sister who are residents and citizens of Iraq. \nHis older brother, a mechanical engineer, is married to a teacher and has two children. \n(Tr. 25, 58, 60) His middle brother, a civil engineer, is married and lives with his older \nbrother. This brother works building roads and schools for the Ministry of Planning. (Tr. \n64, 77) His other brother is a driver whose wife graduated from business school. (Tr. 59, \n60) He has never met his brother\u2019s wife. (Tr. 60) His youngest brother, who was six \nmonths old when his father was executed, is single and is attending business classes in \ncollege. (Tr. 52, 60) Applicant\u2019s only sister, a housewife, married in May 2007 and is \nexpecting a child in 2008. Her husband works for a construction company as a driver. \n(Tr. 61) Applicant\u2019s cousin who lived in Jordan now lives in Iraq. His cousin sometimes \nworks for a construction company and also buys cars. (Tr. 61-62) His family now feels \nsafe with the U.S. presence. (Tr. 81)  \n \n \nApplicant has not talked with his family since October 2007. (Tr. 62) He last saw \nthem in 2004 when his mother died. His family had no telephone. (Tr. 78) During \nSaddam Hussein\u2019s time, his family was not allowed to have a telephone in their home. \n(Tr. 24) Applicant never sent them any letters and any letters received from them had \nbeen opened. (Tr. 79) Starting in 2003, Applicant\u2019s brother would make weekly calls to \ncheck on his family. His uncle had a telephone. (Tr. 92) Prior to 2003, his brother would \nmake a five minute call every three or four months. (Tr. 93)  \n \nPrior to the fall of Saddam Hussein, Applicant sent money may be three times a \nyear to a cousin in Jordan who would give it to his family. (Tr. 53) He would send a \ncouple of hundred dollars every once in a while. (Tr. 24) His brother in the U.S. sends \nabout $200 a month to their youngest brother. (Tr. 100) The money was used to buy \nfood, clothes, and medical supplies. \n \nFollowing the ouster of the former regime in April 2003, Applicant continued \nsending money to his family in Iraq. Applicant was stationed in Iraq and sent the money \nthrough Western Union (Ex. C) purchased in the military exchange. During the time he \nwas in Iraq, he never contacted his family in Iraq. The only family member who knew he \nwas in Iraq was his brother living in the U.S.  \n \n \nApplicant lives in the U.S. with his oldest brother. Applicant has his $40,000 in his \nsaving account and $1,200 in his checking account. (Tr. 68) Both accounts are in the \n \n4\n\nU.S. (Tr. 44) He has no property outside of the U.S. and has no foreign investments. \n(Tr. 45)  \n \nIraq \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Iraq is a constitutional, \nparliamentary democracy with a federal system of government. (Hex I) It is a republic \nwith a freely elected government led by a Prime Minister. (Hex IV) The 2005 Iraqi \nConstitution guarantees all Iraqis basic rights in many areas. Iraq\u2019s legislative branch \nconsists of an elected Council of Representatives. Iraq\u2019s judicial branch is independent, \nand is under no authority but that of the law. The focus of the United States policy in \nIraq remains on helping the Iraqi people build a constitutional, representative \ngovernment that respects the rights of all Iraqis and has security forces capable of \nmaintaining order and preventing the country from become a safe haven for terrorists \nand foreign fighters. The ultimate goal is an Iraq that is peaceful, united, stable, \ndemocratic, and security, with institutions capable of providing just governance and \nsecurity for all Iraqis and is an ally in the war against terrorism.  \n \nThe risk of terrorism directed against U.S. citizens and interests in Iraq remains \nextremely high. (Hex II) The Department of State continues to strongly warn U.S. \ncitizens against travel to Iraq, which remains very dangerous. (Hex III)There is credible \ninformation that terrorists are targeting civil aviation. All vehicular travel in Iraq is \nextremely dangerous. The government was unable to diminish violent attacks, although \nlarge efforts were made to implement better security measures. (Hex IV) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n \n5\n\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has \ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a \nforeign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, \nor is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nguideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign \ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations \nas whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain \nprotected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. (AG & 6) \n \nApplicant has three brothers and a sister who are citizens and residents of Iraq. \nIn 2004, he traveled to Iraq for the first time in 13 years to see his mother before she \ndied. He has provided financial aid to his siblings in Iraq. Having considered all of the \nForeign Influence disqualifying conditions, applicable conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern are AG & 7. AG & 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) and AG & 7(b) (connections to a \nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual=s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \n \n6\n\n \n7\nindividual=s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation) apply. \n \nThe new Iraqi government relies upon the U.S. for support as it moves forward \nwith its new form of government. While Iraq=s human rights record under Saddam \nHussein was very dismal and some problems continue, its human rights record is slowly \nimproving under the new government.  \n \nIn every case where a sibling lives overseas, there is a risk of pressure on this \nrelative and through them upon the holder of a security clearance. Under the facts of \nthis case, a heightened risk for exploitation, inducement, manipulation pressure, or \ncoercion is not substantiated. Applicant has significant ties to the U.S. and few ties to \nIraq. While he still has three brothers and a sister living in Iraq, he lives with his brother \nin the U.S. He has no financial or property interests in Iraq. He wants to help the U.S. in \nIraq. Applicant=s ties with the U.S. are much stronger than his ties with Iraq.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s work as an interpreter supported the U.S. military mission in Iraq.  He \nspent 14 months with U.S. special forces as part of an assault team. Applicant worked \nwith U.S. ground forces in direct contact with enemy forces. He worked long hours in \naustere conditions with an ever present risk of hostile fire. The Army holds his work as a \ntranslator in high regard. He provided more than language interpretation skills. He \nexplained local cultural nuances and practices which greatly assisted the military in \naccomplishing its mission. During his time in Iraq, he worked very hard to help the \nArmy. He developed a high level of trust with the Army. \n \nIf a heightened risk exists because he still has siblings in Iraq, he has mitigated \nthat concern under MC & 8(a) (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the \ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.) and MC & 8(b) (there is no \nconflict of interest, either because the individual=s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest). \n \nApplicant\u2019s older brother, a mechanical engineer, is married to a teacher. His \nmiddle brother, a civil engineer, is married and works building roads and schools. His \nother brother is a driver whose wife graduated from business school. His youngest \nbrother is a freshman in college. Applicant\u2019s sister is a housewife, married to a driver for \na construction company. Applicant\u2019s cousin sometimes works for a construction \ncompany and buys cars. None of them are involved with organizations which seek to \nharm the U.S.  \n \nDuring the 14 months Applicant was in Iraq, he did not contact his siblings. They \nhave not experienced any repercussions from any source because of Applicant. There \nis little likelihood that Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between \n\n \n \n \n8\n                                                          \nthe interests of the U.S. and a foreign entity. Likewise, because of his close ties and his \nloyalties to the U.S., he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance \ndecisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past \ntransgressions. Rather, the objective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, \ncommonsense assessment of a person=s trustworthiness and fitness for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this decision, I have considered the whole person \nconcept in evaluating Applicant=s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national \ninterests. I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iraq and the heavy burden \nan Applicant carries when he has family members in a foreign country.  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \n \nIn the more than 15 years since he left Iraq, Applicant returned twice, once when \nhis mother was dying and once to work as an interpreter for the U.S. Army. Because he \nguided the Army personal on local customs and nuances related to the spoken word \nand responded very well in highly dangerous situations, the Army views him as a \nvaluable resource in helping it achieve its mission in Iraq.2 With his long absence from \nIraq, he has few contacts in the country outside of his four siblings.  \n \nWhile danger certainly exists for all who go to Iraq, Applicant and his siblings are \nin no greater danger than any other individual living and working in Iraq. The U.S. and \nIraq governments have developed a close and positive working relationship. Iraq \ndepends upon the U.S. to help in its fight to combat the developing insurgency and \n \n2In ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov.14, 2006), the Appeal Board recognized an \nexception to the general rule in Guideline B cases when an applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and regulations occurs in the context \nof dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the \nnational security and can be relied upon to recognize, resist and report a foreign power=s attempts at \ncoercion or exploitation. \n\n \n \n \n9\nterrorist forces. The Iraq government is moving forward with democracy and developing \na rule of law, with the assistance of the U.S. \n \nApplicant has no love for the former brutal regime. The Hussein regime killed his \nfather, wounded his brother, and chased him to the boarder before he and his brother \nwere able to escape. Because of his father\u2019s execution and he and his brother\u2019s \npresence in the U.S., his family was ill treated. He has no ties to any organization which \nseeks to harm the U.S. or to overthrown the existing Iraq government. Night after night, \nApplicant went in harms way to assist U.S. special forces in performing their duties in \nIraq.  \n \nI have carefully weighed the evidence in favor of Applicant against the \ngovernment=s concerns about Applicant=s ability to protect classified information. I find \nthat there is little potential for Applicant to be pressured, coerced, or exploited because \nhe has four siblings living in Iraq. Accordingly, I recommend that Applicant be granted a \nsecurity clearance. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nJames F. Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 16, 2008,  DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference),\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence), and Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn November 12, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable decision under Guideline C is not at issue in this appeal.  \n1\nGovernment Exhibit 2, Security Clearance Application, at 28-29, lists three individuals identified as\n2\nstepbrothers of Applicant, who are citizens of Nigeria.\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.  Department Counsel filed a timely cross-appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.28.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s factual\nfindings were supported by substantial record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision under Guideline B was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Department\nCounsel raised the following issue on cross-appeal: whether the Judge erred in his application of the\nGuideline F mitigating conditions.   Finding no harmful error, we affirm.\n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant was born in Nigeria,\nimmigrating to the U.S. in the late 1980s.  He became a U.S. citizen in the early 2000s.  He held a\nNigerian passport, issued after he became a U.S. citizen, but has since turned it over to the facility\nsecurity officer.  \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of Nigeria.  Born there in the early 1960s, she received an\nadvanced degree from a U.S. university.  She applied for U.S. citizenship one day before the hearing\nin Applicant\u2019s case.  Applicant\u2019s father and stepmother are resident citizens of Nigeria.  Applicant\nis close to his father, speaking to him by phone twice a month.  His father owns some real estate in\nNigeria, which Applicant \u201chas an option to inherit.\u201d  Decision at 4.  Applicant also has a brother,\nwho is a resident and citizen of Nigeria, a stepbrother who is a Nigerian citizen but a resident alien\nof the U.S.,  and two sisters, who are naturalized U.S. citizens.  His in-laws are also residents and\n2\ncitizens of Nigeria.  Applicant\u2019s wife communicates with them more frequently than Applicant does\nwith his father.  Applicant traveled to Nigeria five or six times in the six years preceding the close\nof the record.  \nNigeria has a poor human rights record.  Many of its regions are subject to lawlessness,\ncharacterized by armed conflict among various religious, political, and ethnic factions.  In the Niger\nDelta region, for example, kidnaping and other disruptions pose a danger to U.S. citizens traveling\nthere.\nApplicant has experienced some financial difficulties since 2002.  He was unemployed from\nMay 2002 until June 2004, during which time he relied for financial support upon a severance\npackage from his job, upon his savings, upon unemployment compensation, and upon money\nreceived from his church.  He filed twice for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection, but the petitions\nwere dismissed because Applicant could not make the payments.\nThe SOR lists several delinquent debts for Applicant.  The Judge concluded, after comparing\nthe SOR with evidence supplied by both the Government and by Applicant, that only two were\nactually delinquent at the close of the record: a $15,010.00 judgement in favor of a creditor and a\ncredit card debt of $8,927.00.  The remaining debts were either paid, disputed, and/or dropped from\n\nApplicant\u2019s credit report.  \nApplicant challenged some of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact, for example a statement that\nApplicant\u2019s wife did not apply for U.S. citizenship at her first opportunity due to lack of interest.\nDecision at 3.  The Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are\nsupported by substantial record evidence.  See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch\nrelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of\nall the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d) Even if the Judge\u2019s findings contain error,  such error\nis harmless in that it would not change the outcome of the case.  See ISCR Case No. 06-23112 at 2\n(App. Bd. Dec. 31, 2007).  The Judge concluded that the nature and extent of Applicant\u2019s family\nconnections to Nigeria raised security concerns under Guideline B.  In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case\nfor mitigation, he paid attention to the closeness of Applicant\u2019s relations with Nigerian family\nmembers, including his spouse; the frequency of his contact with those living in Nigeria; and the\npossibility that Applicant could inherit property in Nigeria.  Although the Judge gave due\nconsideration to the matters presented by Applicant, including evidence as to the high quality of his\nwork performance and his character, his conclusion that  \u201cit is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance\u201d is sustainable.  Decision at 13.  See\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on May 15, 2008. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on August 19, 2008, and the hearing was held on September 10,\n2008. The transcript was received by DOHA on September 19, 2008. \nAt the hearing, the government submitted eight exhibits (GE 1 through 8).\nAdministrative Notice was also taken of several documents from United States\nNovember 12, 2008\n\n2\nGovernment agency publications that describe the government of Nigeria, its human\nrights record, and various problems U.S. citizens face in traveling to the country. I shall\nalso take administrative notice of Applicant\u2019s Administrative Notice Memorandum,\nincluding two decisions from other Administrative Judges, being offered for that\npurpose.\nAt the hearing, two witnesses testified in Applicant\u2019s behalf. Applicant also\ntestified and presented nine exhibits (AE A through AE I), that were received in\nevidence without objection. AE F through AE I were offered following the hearing. AE F\nis an affidavit from Applicant\u2019s security officer. AE G is a letter from Applicant\u2019s church\nregarding his travel in 2003. AE H is a letter from a collection firm regarding a debt\ndescribed in SOR 3.c. AE I is a Nigerian passport that expired in June 2004. In AE J,\nApplicant\u2019s additional comments to the SOR three pages in length, Applicant indicates\nhe is an associate pastor and head of the council of his church, responsible for the\nfinancial and administrative resources of the church. Based upon a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied. \nRulings on Procedure\nIn a Memorandum For Administrative Judge Regarding Post Hearings\nSubmissions, filed on October 2, 2008, Department Counsel stated the government had\nno objection to AE F through AE I, but made certain observations which have been duly\nnoted. \nFindings of Fact\nThe three guidelines alleged in the SOR are foreign preference, foreign\ninfluence, and financial considerations.

(Tr. 69) In 2005 and 2006, as alleged in SOR 1.d.,\nApplicant used his Nigerian passport instead of his U.S. passport for travel in and out of\nNigeria (Tr. 70, 113) \nApplicant turned in his passport on September 9, 2008 to one of the federal\nfacility security officers (FSO) for the federal disease control agency. (Tr. 72; AE B) On\nSeptember 16, 2008, Applicant\u2019s Nigerian passport was transferred to the FSO of\nApplicant\u2019s employer since the FSO for contractor employees, not the FSO for federal\nemployees, has authority to assume custody over foreign passports. (AE F) When\nasked why he waited so long to surrender his passport after receiving the SOR in April\n2008, he replied he was very busy at work with hurricane responses, and was recently\nadvised by his attorney to turn the passport over to the FSO. (Tr. 123) Applicant did not\nseek advice from anyone from DOHA on how to relinquish the passport. (Tr. 124)\nApplicant opined that if he had known that having a Nigerian passport would cause a\nsecurity problem, he would not have applied for it. (Tr. 70-73)\nForeign Influence\nSOR 2.a. Applicant\u2019s wife was born in December 1963. She immigrated to the\nU.S. on a student visa in 1989 to begin graduate school. In 1989, she completed a\nMaster\u2019s degree in Communications in the U.S. She married Applicant in March 1993\n(GE 1), and not March 2003. (Tr. 60, 65, 105) She has her permanent resident card.\nShe did not apply for citizenship in 2000 when first eligible because she was not\ninterested in becoming a U.S. citizen; she applied on September 9, 2008. (Tr. 105) Due\nto a debilitating health condition that makes it difficult for her to sustain employment,\nApplicant\u2019s wife has not been employed since his two-year period of unemployment\nbetween May 2002 and June 2004. Applicant and his wife have three children, all born\nin the U.S. The first was born in December 1993, the second in March 1995, and the\nthird in February 2000. (GE 1) \nSOR 2.b. Applicant\u2019s father and stepmother are resident citizens of Nigeria. His\nfather was born in April 1933. Applicant\u2019s mother is deceased. The father, formerly an\nassociate director of a Nigerian radio corporation, retired after a military coup in 2004,\nand lives on a pension. (Tr. 65) As noted below, he also receives income from\ncommercial buildings he owns. Applicant is very close to his father (Tr. 64), and\ntelephones him about twice a month, but estimated his wife\u2019s communication with her\nparents was more frequent. (Tr. 66) Applicant sent his father about $500.00 in 2005 and\n2006 to address immediate medical problems. (Tr. 64, SOR 2.g.) Applicant no longer\nsends money as his father is financially self-sufficient now. (Tr. 115) Applicant\u2019s father\ntried to immigrate to the U.S. about 1 \u00bd years ago, but his visitor\u2019s visa was denied\nbased on his inability to show sufficient ties to Nigeria. (Tr. 130; AE 8) After realizing his\nfather needed better medical attention, Applicant believes that circumstances warrant\nhis father seeking a more permanent resident status in the U.S. (Tr. 131)\nRegarding the subject of foreign financial interests, Applicant testified he owned\nno assets, but his father owns some land and a home or two located in Nigeria, and he\n\n4\nhas an option to inherit the property. (Tr. 140) Applicant could not apply a value to the\nproperty because he asserted he has been in the U.S. for about 20 years, and he knew\nvery little about the Nigerian property market. (Tr. 141) He was able to give some\ndescription of the property. He stated, \u201cWhat it is - - is just commercial buildings that he\nleases out to business people and they operate their business out of these areas an you\ncollect from.\u201d (Id.) \nApplicant\u2019s stepmother was born in Nigeria in April 1935. She holds a U.S.\npermanent resident card and is currently living with her sons in a state in the western\npart of the U.S. Applicant\u2019s last contact with her was about 1 \u00bd years ago. According to\nApplicant, she visits the U.S. occasionally. (Tr. 137)\nSOR 2.c. In his answer, Applicant admitted he had a brother who is a resident\ncitizen of Nigeria. However, there are no references in GE 1, GE 3, or the transcript to a\nbrother who is a resident citizen of Nigeria. Applicant furnished testimony about his\nstepbrother who lives on the west coast of the U.S.  The step brother is a U.S. resident\nalien who served in the U.S. Navy, and is pursuing a career in the pharmaceutical\nindustry. (Tr. 61, 62) Because the relative was not correctly identified in the allegations\nof foreign influence, SOR 2.c. is found for Applicant. \nSOR 2.d. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law was born in Nigeria in August 1940, and is a\nresident citizen of the country. She has always been a homemaker. Applicant\u2019s father-\nin-law was born in Nigeria in October 1935. He was a professor at a college in the\nMidwest until 2002, when he and his wife relocated Nigeria. (GE 3) The father-in-law is\nretired, and also is an education advisor to one of the state governments of Nigeria. (Tr.\n67; SOR 2.e.)\nSOR 2.f. Applicant traveled to Nigeria about five to six times in the last six years,\nbut remembered visits in 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006. (Tr. 62, 113) Because he had not\nseen his family for some time, and also had not seen the country since 1989 (Tr. 62-63),\nparticularly his ill father, Applicant visited the country in 2003. He financed his first trip in\n2003 with his own money. All his visits to see relatives lasted about two weeks. (GE 3) \nApplicant has an older sister who was born in Nigeria in November 1961. She is\na naturalized U.S. citizen, and employed as an administrative law judge in a\nnortheastern part of the U.S. (Tr. 61; GE 3) A younger sister, born in Nigeria in August\n1964, is a naturalized U.S. citizen and an attorney with a federal maritime agency in the\nmiddle Atlantic region of the U.S. \nIn his interview (GE 3) with an investigator with the Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM), Applicant indicated he could not be pressured into disclosing\ninformation to a foreign entity. No one has ever threatened or pressured him to divulge\nclassified information. Applicant indicated his allegiance is with the U.S. Applicant\ntestified he would abide by security rules by disclosing any effort to pressure or\ninfluence him. (Tr. 101)\n\n5\nFinancial Considerations\nIn GE 3, Applicant attributed his financial problems to his unemployment from\nMay 2002 to June 2004. During the period he was to survive for a time on his severance\npackage from his previous employment. Then, he had to depend on his savings,\nunemployment compensation, and sporadic monetary dispensation from the church. He\ntried to resolve his debts through two Chapter 13 petitions (SOR 3.a., 3.b.), but both\npetitions were dismissed because the payments were too large. \nSOR 3.c. The creditor filed a judgment against Applicant in April 2003 for\n$9427.00. (AE C) The amount is currently $15,010.00 as noted in the SOR. Applicant\nhas not paid the debt because he is waiting for a reasonable payment plan. (Tr. 82) AE\nH shows that the collection firm offered Applicant a judgment payoff of $14,041.00 that\nexpired on April 23, 2008. \nSOR 3.d. The credit card creditor is due $8,927.00. Applicant recalls he was a\nuser on this card. (Tr. 82, 83, 159) There is no record of action on this debt. \nSOR 3.e. The revenue debt was paid in March 2008 (AE A) and the account was\ndeleted. (AE D, credit agency dispute resolution reporting mechanism) The account no\nlonger appears in GE 6. \nSOR 3.f. The tax debt of $1,809.00 was paid in December 2004. (AE C)\nSOR 3.g. The collection account reflects a zero balance based on GE 7 and AE\nD.\nSOR 3.h. The account does not appear in GE 7. AE D reflects the account was\ndeleted. Applicant never had an account with this bank. (Tr. 163)\nSOR 3.i. The telephone account does not appear in GE 7, and according to AE\nD, was disputed account was deleted. \nSOR 3.j. This account is not addressed in AE D, but it does not appear in GE 7.\nApplicant believes that the errant accounts appear in his credit report due to a\nsecurity breach that occurred at his employer. (Tr. 166)\nApplicant currently earns about $65,000.00 from his employer (Tr. 154), and has\na monthly remainder of between $500.00 and $700.00 a month. (Tr. 175) He owns a\n1994 auto that is paid for. His wife drives a 2004 car. (Tr. 177) Applicant\u2019s current rent is\napproximately $1,800.00 a month. Applicant and his wife have tried to keep control over\ntheir expenditures by following a budget. Having carefully compared GE 7 with AE C\nand AE D, the only delinquent financial accounts are the judgement identified in 3.c. of\nthe SOR, and the charge card account reflected in 3.d. The judgment and the credit\ncard account total almost $24,000.00.\n\n6\nA review of GE 7, AE C, and AE D reflects Applicant settled with four creditors\n(listed and unlisted in the SOR) in an amount totaling approximately $7470.00\nCharacter Evidence\nMs. A, the tax management group lead, explained that her job includes\nmonitoring the account measures that store the pharmaceutical stockpile of drugs. She\nmet Applicant on her first day of work in June 2005. Ms. A considers Applicant\ntrustworthy and also knowledgeable about the information needed at the job. Ms. A\nexplained that the contractor and the stockpile project schedule annual training sessions\nfor contractor or employees and federal employees that address sensitive information\nissues and procedures that an employee should take if he is pressured for sensitive\ninformation. (Tr. 33) \nMr. B, the lead response specialist and a federal employee, testified his duties\ninclude the stockpile project. When he was a contractor employee in 2004, he hired\nApplicant (Tr. 42) and was his supervisor for several months, and now as federal\nemployee, reviews the billing that Applicant submits. During his testimony regarding\nApplicant\u2019s excellent job performance, Mr. B considers Applicant dependable, and cited\nan example of completing some accounting work or balancing the books at the end of a\nfiscal period. The accounting work involved electronically connecting to the computers\nat the stockpile project while Applicant was in Nigeria. (Tr. 44) Applicant performed this\naccounting work or \u201cclosing the books\u201d periodically. (Tr. 52) Mr. B believes Applicant is\ntrustworthy. (Id.)\nApplicant received an award for distinguished service from a federal agency in\nJune 2006 for his work during the three major hurricanes in 2005. (AE E) AE G is a\nletter dated September 15, 2008 from the senior pastor describing the church\u2019s decision\nto send Applicant to Nigeria in April 2003 to reorganize the church\u2019s operations in the\ncountry, and to provide him with an opportunity to see his ailing father; the church\nagreed to pay his airfare. \nAdministrative Notice\nI have taken administrative notice GE 4 that consists of the following government\ndocuments:\nU.S. Department of State, Bureau of African Affairs, Background Note: Nigeria,\ndated April 2008;\nU.S. Department of State, Consular Information Sheet, Nigeria, dated April 16,\n2007;\nU.S. Department of State, Travel Warning: Nigeria, dated October 30, 2007\n\n7\nU.S. Department of State, Nigeria: Country Reports of Human Rights Practices-\n2006, dated March 6, 2007; and,\nCongressional Research Service, CRS Report for Congress, Nigeria: Current\nIssues, January 30, 2008. \nNigeria, since gaining its independence in 1960, has been controlled more by\nmilitary rulers than democratically elected civilian rulers. Even though the government\nreturned to civilian rule in 1999, the government continues to have a poor human rights\nrecord. The lack of law and order in various areas of the country results in internal,\nperiodic armed conflicts between religious, political and ethnic factions, and also creates\nstrife for U.S. citizens traveling to the country, particularly in the Niger Delta region. The\nproblems emerge in the form of kidnaping and shakedowns at checkpoints. Recognizing\nthe troubling problems in the Niger Delta region, the current president, elected in May\n2007, has pledged to restore peace and security to the region, while instilling long-term,\nelectoral reform throughout the country. President Bush considers Nigeria an important\npartner in the war on terror. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt  concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\n\n8\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nForeign Preference (FP)\n9. The Concern. When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a\npreference for a foreign country over the U.S., then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the U.S. \u00b6 9.\nWhen Applicant obtained and used his Nigerian passport in 2005 and 2006 after\nreceiving his U.S. citizenship and passport in March 2003, he was exercising dual\ncitizenship. FP DC 10.a.(1) (exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember - possession of a current passport) applies. Possession, renewal and/or use of\nthe foreign passport after being naturalized as a U.S. citizen constitutes the exercise of\na privilege of his Nigerian citizenship that he was not entitled to.\nApplicant\u2019s dual citizenship is based on more than his birth in a foreign country.\nHence, FP MC 11.a. (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a\nforeign country) is not applicable. Though Applicant has provided statements\nconcerning his willingness to renounce his Nigerian citizenship, there has been no\naction to support these statements. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence in the\nrecord to confer meaningful consideration to FP MC 11.b. (the individual has expressed\na willingness to renounce dual citizenship)\nFP MC 11.e. (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant\nauthority, or otherwise invalidated) indicates in unequivocal language that if the person\nwants to demonstrate his intent to relinquish his foreign citizenship, then he must take\naction set forth in the mitigating condition. Even though Applicant may not have taken\nsufficient action to revoke his dual citizenship, he complied with FP MC 11.e. On\nSeptember 9, 2008, Applicant surrendered his passport to the FSO. Within seven days,\nApplicant\u2019s Nigerian passport was transferred to the appropriate official to maintain\npermanent custody over the passport. The surrender of the passport, while taking more\n\n9\nthan four months to consummate, complies with the FP mitigating condition and\nwarrants a conclusion for Applicant under the FP guideline. \nForeign Influence (FI)\n6. The Concern. \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target U.S.\ncitizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with the risk of terrorism.\u201d \u00b6\n6.\nThe mere possession of family ties in foreign country is not automatically\ndisqualifying under the foreign influence guideline. However, one relative living in a\nforeign country creates the potential for foreign influence. When assessing the family\nties, it is important to weigh the totality of these ties in a foreign country, rather than\ntrying to weigh them in isolation. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sept. 22,\n2003) \nIn determining whether FI disqualifying condition (DC) 7.a. (contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) applies to this\ncase,  an evaluation of factors other than the citizenship and residence of the family\nmembers, including the political character of the foreign country in question, its\nrelationship to the U.S., and the prospects an applicant\u2019s family members may be\nsubject to pressure or coercion. If the foreign family member is associated/employed or\ndependent on the government, or the government is authoritarian, then the chances for\nforeign influence directed to and through the foreign family member are more likely.\nEven friendly nations commit acts that infringe upon another nation\u2019s sovereignty.\nSignificantly, there is no evidence of the Nigerian government targeting U.S. citizens for\nprotected information. Yet, criminal activity continues to present significant dangers\nthroughout areas of Nigeria, even though the present leader is determined to improve\nthe overall peace and security in the country. \nThe citizenship/residence status of Applicant\u2019s father and stepmother, his trips to\nNigeria, and the money transferred to his father in 2005, create a heightened risk of\nforeign influence under FI DC 7.a. This heightened risk for foreign influence is magnified\nby the option Applicant has to inherit his father\u2019s property. \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law, the DOHA Appeal Board\nhas held that there is a rebuttable presumption that an applicant has close ties of\naffection, or at least obligation, to members of his wife\u2019s family. ISCR Case No. 01-\n\n10\n03120 at 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). Therefore, the heightened risk of foreign influence\nextends to Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law who are resident citizens of\nNigeria. \nThe citizenship of Applicant\u2019s wife in Nigeria, and residence in the U.S. invokes\nthe application of FI DC 7.d. (sharing living quarters with a person or persons,\nregardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion)\nOnly Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is employed by one of the Nigerian state\ngovernments as an advisor on educational matters. He is not connected to the military\nor a security position within the government of Nigeria. None of Applicant\u2019s other,\nimmediate family members work for the government of Nigeria. None are agents of the\ncountry\u2019s government. Applicant\u2019s wife is a homemaker, partly due to her health\ncondition. She has her permanent resident card and is applying for her U.S. citizenship.\nHis father draws a pension in his retirement from a civil servant job with the national\nradio corporation. According to Applicant, he also derives earnings from space he\nleases in his commercial buildings. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a homemaker. Her\nhusband (Applicant\u2019s father-in-law) is semi-retired and works as an education advisor\nfor one of the states in Nigeria. Applicant no longer sends money to his father because\nof his self-sufficiency. The close ties Applicant has to his father, mother-in law and\nfather-in-law, who are resident citizens of Nigeria, and the close ties he has with his\nspouse, a citizen of Nigeria and resident of the U.S., creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, pressure or coercion for Applicant because of the law and order problems\nin Nigeria. This heightened risk for foreign influence has not been established regarding\nhis stepmother who he has not has contact with for about 1 \u00bd years. \nFI DC 7.a. can potentially be mitigated by FC mitigating condition (MC) 8.a. (the\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the position or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.); FI MC 8.b. (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nminimal, or the individual has such deep and long-lasting relationships and loyalties in\nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of\nthe U.S. interest); and FI MC 8.c. (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so\ncasual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation) First, Applicant\u2019s contacts with his father, mother-in-law and\nfather-in-law are not casual nor infrequent. He has regular contact with his father, and\nsent him money in 2005 and 2006. Applicant\u2019s close relationship with his father is\nsubstantiated by the fact he has an option to inherit his father\u2019s property. The record\nreflects that through his wife, Applicant has a close relationship with his mother-in-law\nand father-in-law. The inheritance option that Applicant has to his father\u2019s property,\nnotwithstanding his inability to apply a value,  precludes a finding that Applicant can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \n\n11\nReviewing the evidence for longstanding relationships in the U.S., the American\ncitizenship of Applicant\u2019s two sisters involved in the legal profession constitutes\nfavorable evidence of ties Applicant has in the U.S., even though the extent of that\nrelationship was not developed in the record. Applicant\u2019s three children, U.S. citizens,\nestablish additional evidence of his bonds to this country. However, neither his bonds to\nimmediate family members or his professional ties for the last four years are sufficient to\nremove the heightened risk of foreign inducement or coercion created by his spouse, a\ncitizen of Nigeria living with Applicant, and his father, mother-in-law, and father-in-law\nwho are resident citizens of Nigeria. Viewing the totality of the evidence, I am unable to\nconclude that Applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the\nU.S. On balance, while his stepmother is removed as a security concern under FI MC\n8.a., the evidence adduced under FI MC 8.a., FI MC 8.b., FI MC 8.c. does not\nsufficiently remove the foreign influence concerns associated with Applicant\u2019s spouse,\nhis father, mother-in-law, and father-in-law. \nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\u201d \nThis case activates FC disqualifying condition (DC) 19.a. (inability or\nunwillingness to repay debts) and FC DC 19.c. (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations) based on the SOR 2.c. and 2.d. debts totaling almost $24,000.00 that are\nstill outstanding. A history of not meeting financial obligations is underscored by the\nexistence of the judgment (SOR 3.c.) since 2003.\nFC mitigating condition (MC) 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the individual\u2019s control, and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances) and FC MC 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) receive some\nconsideration based on Applicant\u2019s unemployment from May 2002 to June 2004, and\nhis responsible conduct in paying off four debts totaling $7470.00 since 2004. The fact\nthat he was successful in having certain debts correctly deleted from his credit report\nconstitutes evidence of good judgment also. Considering all the evidence presented\nunder the FC guideline, including his wife\u2019s inability to work and the cost requirements in\nraising their three children, Applicant is making a good faith effort to work out a\nsettlement with one of the two delinquent accounts demonstrated by AE H, the\nnotification from the collection firm in SOR 2.c. advising Applicant of a payoff figure he\ncould not meet. I believe he will continue to meet the remaining past due obligations.\nThe FC guideline is resolved in his favor. \n\n12\nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nMy finding for Applicant under the FI and FP guidelines must still be evaluated in\nthe context of nine variables known as the whole person concept. In evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the administrative judge should consider the\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence\nor absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe disqualifying and mitigating conditions have been considered in light of the\nevidence as a whole. Applicant has met his burden of persuasion under the foreign\npreference guideline by surrendering his passport in September 2008. Concerning the\nforeign influence guideline, Applicant\u2019s character evidence from Ms. A and Mr. B weighs\nheavily in his favor, along with the recognition Applicant received for his contributions\nduring the hurricane season of 1995. I have considered his position in his church, and\nhis sisters being naturalized U.S. citizens. However, his inheritance option of\ncommercial buildings as he described them, even though he was unable to apply a\nvalue, and his close ties with his wife, a citizen of Nigeria, and the other identified family\nmembers who are resident citizens of Nigeria raise continuing security concerns about\nhis vulnerability to coercion or influence. Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns that remain regarding foreign influence. The two financial debts that currently\ntotal almost $24,000.00 occurred when Applicant was unemployed. His document\npayment of four of the overdue debts in the last four years provides sufficient grounds to\nbelieve he will satisfy the remaining creditors. Though Applicant has mitigated the\nforeign preference and financial considerations guidelines, he has failed to mitigate\nforeign influence. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Foreign Preference, Guideline C):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant\n\n13\nSubparagraph 2 (Foreign Influence, Guideline B): \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g. \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b.\nFor Applicant.\nSubparagraph 3.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d. \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.e.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.f.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.g.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.h.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.i.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.j.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Murphy, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Fadi F. Toma, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. \n \n  History of Case \n \nOn December 12, 2005, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On April 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nAugust 20, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 21, 2008, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on June 17, \n2008. The case was originally assigned to me on June 17, 2008, and then reassigned to \nanother administrative judge on June 20, 2008. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nJune 25, 2008, scheduling the hearing for July 16, 2008. On July 14, 2008, the assigned \nadministrative judge had a medical emergency that necessitated the cancellation of the \nhearing. The hearing was rescheduled to July 17, 2008, with both parties\u2019 consent, and \nthe case was reassigned to me. I convened the hearing on said date. The Government \noffered Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were received into the record without objection. \nApplicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A through O that was admitted into the \nrecord without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 28, \n2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iraq. (Tr. 13). The request and the attached documents are \nincluded in the record as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I through V. Applicant\u2019s counsel did not \nobject to my consideration of those Exhibits. Hence, the facts administratively noticed \nare limited to matters of general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable \ndispute. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated May 21, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c of the SOR and offered explanations in support of his \nrequest for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 47 years old. He was born in Iraq and attended high school there. \nFrom September 1979 to September 1983, he attended an Iraqi university and \ngraduated with a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture. As required by the Iraqi \ngovernment, he served in its army from 1984 to 1990 after graduating from the \nuniversity. After completing military service, he moved to Jordan for two years because \nhe could not find a job in Iraq. When he returned to Iraq in 1993, he found a position as \nan agricultural engineer. In 1995 he married a woman, who was a U.S. citizen, residing \nin Iraq with her Iraqi parents. In 1998, he and his wife left Iraq and moved to the United \nStates. (Tr. 51). In 1999, they divorced. He no longer communicates with her. (Tr. 54). \nPresently, he is working on a master\u2019s degree at a U.S. university. (Tr. 46). \n \n \nApplicant obtained permanent U.S. residency in 1998. (Tr. 54). After arriving in \nthe United States, he worked as a proof reader at a university. (Tr. 47). He became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in August 2005. In December 2005, he returned to Iraq for the \nfirst time since leaving it in 1998. (Tr. 27; 48).   \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s parents were born in Iraq and are deceased. His mother died \nin 1989 and his father died in July 2006. (Tr. 54). He is one of four children, all born in \nIraq. He has one brother and two sisters. His brother, an engineer, is a resident citizen \nof Iraq and married. Applicant last saw his brother in Jordan in December 2006 at a \nfamily reunion after his father died. Applicant does not know where he lives and speaks \nto him very infrequently, the last time being about four months ago. (Tr. 33-34; 60). \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s two sisters are residents and citizens of Iraq. One is married to an \nIraqi citizen, who is an agricultural engineer. His other sister is divorced.  Both sisters \nwork in Iraqi hospitals. (Tr. 57). Prior to the December 2006 family gathering in Jordan, \nApplicant had not seen or spoken to his sisters or his brother-in-law since leaving Iraq in \n1998. (Tr. 34; 59). All of his siblings were very happy when Saddam was ousted from \nthe government. (Tr. 35-36).  \n \n \nSometime in December 2006 after the family gathering, Applicant\u2019s brother \nreceived a death threat over the telephone from an unknown person. The brother \nimmediately called Applicant, who then notified his commander. Two days later, the \ncommander re-located Applicant to remove any potential harm. (Tr. 38-39; 64). His \nbrother subsequently moved to Jordan. (Tr. 65). Applicant thinks his brother was singled \nout because Applicant had appeared on television discussing agricultural successes he \nachieved with the Iraqi farmers. (Tr. 62). Neither he nor his brother ever received any \nother threat. (Tr.  40-41). No one else in his family has ever received a threat. (Tr. 67). \nHis family does not know what he presently does for a living. (Tr. 67). \n \n \nAfter receiving his citizenship in August 2005, Applicant filed an Immigrant \nPetition for Relative in November 2005 for each of his three siblings, hoping to bring \nthem to the United States. (AE B).  He does not know the status of the Petitions, other \nthan that they remain pending. (Tr. 36). \n \n \n \n \nIn December 2005, Applicant was hired as an agricultural advisor and engineer \nfor a federal contractor that supports the U.S. military forces in Iraq. (Tr. 48). He \nsubsequently received an interim Secret security clearance that allowed him access to \nclassified information. (Tr. 44).  During the tenure of his employment, he returns home \nto the United States for two weeks of vacation approximately every six months. (Tr. 42-\n44). While in Iraq, Applicant did not visit his family, even though he knew his father was \nvery sick in 2006. (Tr. 55).   \n \n \n \n \nApplicant owns a condominium in the United States and has U. S. bank \naccounts. (Tr. 3). He does not own any property in Iraq. (Tr. 68). There is no derogatory \ninformation concerning his police or financial records. He has never been fired from a \njob. He has never been arrested. He has never used illegal drugs, or been involved in \nan alcohol-related incident. (GE 1).  \n \n \nWithout including too many details in this opinion, I will summarize that his \nperformance in Iraq, in direct support of the United States\u2019 war on terrorism, has been \nsuperior. A Foreign Service officer in charge of a reconstruction team stated: \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \n [Applicant] is the most effective community organizer I have ever seen. \nWith insurgents exploiting drought-ridden rural [province] as a base if \noperations, [Applicant] developed an agricultural strategy to counter the \nlure of insurgent pay-offs and overcome Saddam-era prejudices. He \nmentored diverse religious and ethnic leaders into joining in U.S. backed \nfarm associations that offered unprecedented political unity and the benefit \nof collective economic bargaining. Thanks to [Applicant\u2019s] planning, \ndedication and courage, areas that were once insurgent strongholds and \nhotbeds of clan violence now see cooperative economic planning and \nagricultural efficiency. (AE L). \n \n \nA Major in the U.S. Army wrote that Applicant\u2019s technical expertise, coupled with \nhis innate understanding of the Iraqi culture and language has made him an invaluable \nasset to Coalition Forces.\u201d (AE M). In June 2008, Applicant received a Meritorious \nHonor Award from the Department of State for his \u201cexceptional joint effort to move \nhundreds of farm families through the steps of organization, registration, funding and \nbusiness planning that enable community-based institutions to promote profitable and \npeaceful co-existence.\u201d (AE O). Some of his monthly performance evaluations \nconsistently grade him as \u201cexceeding expectations.\u201d (AE J). \n \n \nIn June 2008, another economic chief of the reconstruction efforts wrote: \u201cAs a \nsecurity cleared Foreign Service Officer entrusted with the protection of U.S. interest \nand information overseas in posts with the highest threats of attack and espionage, I \ncan say that I fully trust [Applicant] to protect and defend the interests of the United \nStates.\u201d (AE L).  \n \n \nThere is no evidence in the record that while holding a security clearance in Iraq, \nApplicant breached any security policies or procedures. \n \n \nApplicant credibly and sincerely asserted his pride of U.S. citizenship. He \ndecided to apply for a position with the U.S. forces because he fully supported the \nouster of Saddam and freedom for Iraq. \u201cI felt like part of my responsibility to be part of \nthe team, provide something, or I can do something there. I have the culture from there \nand I am a citizen here.\u201d (Tr. 28).  \n \nI take administrative notice of the facts set forth in the Hearing Exhibits, including \nthe fact that in 2003, the United States led a coalition to remove Saddam Hussein from \npower in Iraq. After free elections, Iraq\u2019s new government took office. Despite the \nelections and new government, Iraq remains engulfed in violence, perpetrated by Al \nQaeda terrorists and other insurgents. Numerous attacks and kidnappings have \ntargeted the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors, and other civilians, as well as Iraqis. Even \nwith aggressive governmental action against terrorists, the threat of terrorism in Iraq \nremains, although there has been a decrease in violence since January 2001. \u201cAn \nimproved security environment has resulted from the combined factors of Coalition \ntroop surge and sustained presence, the declared ceasefire by Muqtada al-Sadr\u2019s Jaysh \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nal-Mahdi militia in August, improved Iraqi Security Forces proficiency, and increasing \npopular support for the actions of Iraqi Forces against AQI and other extremist groups.\u201d \n(HE IV). Terrorist groups conduct intelligence activities as effectively as state \nintelligence services. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security clearance  decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions adverse to an \napplicant shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in \nAG & 6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Department Counsel argued that the evidence in this case established two \nof them:  \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;1 and,  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.  \n \nSince 1998, Applicant has had some contact with his three siblings, who are \nresident citizens of Iraq. None of them have any government connection or other \n                                            \n1 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of \nlaw, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nposition in which they could otherwise benefit from his access to sensitive information or \ntechnology. However, in December 2006, his connection to his brother created a \npotential conflict of interest between his security obligations and a desire to help his \nbrother, when the brother was confronted with a death threat. Given that situation, \n(albeit an isolated one) security concerns are raised under both disqualifying conditions \nas there may be a possibility that hostile forces might seek protected information from \nApplicant by threatening harm to his family members in Iraq.  \n  \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these disqualifying conditions, \nand the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of the \nresulting security concerns. AG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Those with potential application in this case: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nThe positions and activities of Applicant\u2019s family members in Iraq do not involve \nthe government or military, and they would have no interest in acquiring protected \ninformation. Only their physical presence creates the potential that their interests could \nbe threatened to the point that Applicant would confront a choice between their interests \nand those of the United States. Because they are strongly opposed to terrorism in Iraq, \nthe likelihood of such a situation is substantially reduced. The Iraqi government is a U.S. \nally that does not pose an intelligence risk through Applicant\u2019s family members, who \nsupport the Iraqi and coalition efforts to defeat terrorists and establish a working \ndemocracy. However, AG \u00b6 8(a) is given only partial application as a result of the \nprevious incident involving Applicant\u2019s brother.  \n \nApplicant produced very significant evidence establishing mitigating condition of \n8(b). Based on his relationship and depth of loyalty to the U.S., he can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. He has lived in the United \nStates since 1998 and did not return to Iraq until his employment with the U. S. armed \nforces in 2005. He went to Iraq to support the U.S. troops out of his sense of duty and \n\n \n \n \n \n8\npatriotism, and has placed his life at risk during some of his operations. He owns real \nestate and holds bank accounts in the United States. He is pursuing a master\u2019s degree \nat a U.S. university. In contrast, his Iraqi interests are minimal. He does not own \nproperty in Iraq and has very limited contact with three siblings living there. The record \ndoes not contain any evidence that he has connections or contact with any people other \nthan his family. \n \nApplicant has had very limited communication with his two sisters since 1998. \nThe last time he spoke to them was in December 2006 in Jordan. He speaks to his \nbrother infrequently, although on an on-going basis.  Based on his lack of \ncommunication with his sisters since December 2006, mitigating condition 8(c) has \nsome application as to them. It does not have application to his brother with whom he \nhas infrequent, but regular contact. \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The Appeal Board \nrequires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s personal \nloyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family ties to the U.S. relative to his [or \nher] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties within the U.S.; and many others raised by \nthe facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).   \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Four circumstances weigh against \nApplicant in the whole person analysis.  First, there is a significant risk of terrorism and \nhuman rights abuses in Iraq. More importantly for security purposes, terrorists are \nhostile to the United States and actively seek classified information. Terrorists, and even \nfriendly governments, could attempt to use Applicant\u2019s siblings to obtain such \ninformation. Second, his brother received a death threat because of Applicant\u2019s \npresence in Iraq and assistance with the coalition forces. Third, he had numerous \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nconnections to Iraq before he immigrated to the United States in 1998. Following his \nbirth, he spent his formative years there. He was educated at an Iraqi university, and \nwas conscripted into its army. Later, he worked there for several years as an agricultural \nengineer. Fourth, three siblings remain resident citizens of Iraq, for whom he is trying to \nobtain resident alien status in the United States.  \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security \nclearance. He is a mature person, who has lived in the United States for 10 years, and \nhas been a naturalized citizen for three years.  Out of his sense of patriotism and love \nfor the United States, he joined with the U.S. armed forces, as an Arabic-speaking \nlinguist and agricultural engineer for a federal contractor, and willingly placed himself in \npositions that pose physical risks. His ties to the United States, which he refers to as his \ncountry, are much stronger than his connections to three siblings in Iraq, two of which \nhe barely contacts. There is no evidence he has ever taken any action that could cause \npotential harm to the United States, and he appropriately handled the situation that \ninvolved a threat to his brother. He takes his loyalty to the United States seriously, and \nhe has worked diligently for a defense contractor for several years in an important \ncapacity. His supervisors assess him as loyal, trustworthy, conscientious, and \nresponsible, giving him excellent evaluations and praising his dedication to the cause of \nfreedom in Iraq. He is an excellent employee and U.S. citizen. After leaving Iraq in \n1998, he never returned, until he began working with the U.S. troops in December 2005. \nNo witnesses recommended denial of his security clearance. There is not any \nderogatory information about him in the record.  \n \nApplicant held a security clearance during his tenure with the U.S. forces without \nany indication that he breached security policies or procedures. While that fact is not \nnormally to be considered as a significant factor in granting a clearance, the Appeal \nBoard ruled in ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006) as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, 2006). \nThe presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an applicant\u2019s \nassertion that he can be relied upon to recognizes, resist, and report a \nforeign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n10\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns pertaining to foreign influence.2 Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from foreign influence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n                                            \n2 I conclude that the whole person analysis weighs heavily toward approval of his security clearance. \nAssuming a higher authority reviewing this decision determines the mitigating conditions articulated under \nAG \u00b68 do not apply and severs any consideration of them, I conclude the whole person analysis standing \nalone is sufficient to support approval of a security clearance in this case. \n",

On December 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline C, Foreign Preference, for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn January 17, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nFebruary 11, 2008. The case was assigned to me on February 14, 2008. On March 11, \n2008, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for March 27, 2008. The \nhearing was held as scheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits (Gov) 1-\n3, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified at the hearing. The record \nwas held open until March 27, 2008, to allow the Applicant to submit further documents. \nMay 8, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant timely submitted two documents prior to the close of the record which were \nadmitted as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-B without objection. DOHA received the transcript \nof hearing on April 9, 2008. The record closed on April 9, 2008. Based upon a review of \nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated December 6, 2007, Applicant admitted to SOR \nallegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b -1.e, and denies the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, and 1.g.  \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old information technology (IT) manager employed with a \nDepartment of Defense contractor. He has been employed with his current employer \nsince October 2005. He has a Master\u2019s Degree in Computer Science. He is single and \nhas no children. This is his first time applying for a security clearance. (Tr at 4-5; Gov 1.)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents were Mexican citizens at the time of his birth. He was born in \nthe U.S. but his family lived in Mexico across the border from the U.S. city where he \nwas born. His parents registered his birth in the U.S. and in Mexico. (Tr at 14\u201315.)

His mother became a \nU.S. citizen in 1991. His father became a U.S. citizen in 2000. (Gov 1.) He has a sister \nand brother who are citizens of and live in the U.S. His sister is a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen. His brother was born in the U.S. (Tr at 29-30; Gov 1.)   \n \nFrom January 2000 to October 2005, Applicant worked for a company located \nacross the border in Mexico. He commuted from the U.S. during this time. U.S. citizens \nwere required to obtain work permits to work in Mexico. Applicant\u2019s company applied for \nthe work permit on his behalf. (Gov 1; Gov 3.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s grandmother lives in Mexico. He visits her in Mexico approximately \nonce a week on the weekends. She lives in the city just across the border from where \nApplicant resides. Applicant also occasionally visits several school friends who reside in \nthe same city in Mexico on the weekends as well. His visits are usually day trips. (Tr at \n27.) \n \nIn early 2006, Applicant entered into a business agreement with two of his \nfriends.  They opened up a fast food burrito business in Mexico in the fall 2006. As a \nprerequisite to operate a business in Mexico, Applicant was required to a obtain a \nMexican passport to show Mexican heritage. In 2006, Applicant applied for a Mexican \npassport. The passport was valid from June 23, 2006 to June 23, 2007. The Mexican \npassport also made it easier for Applicant to travel in Mexico. He also has a U.S. \npassport issued on February 2, 2000, with an expiration date of February 1, 2010. (Tr at \n11,18; Gov 1; Gov 2; Gov 3.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant invested approximately $13,000 in the business. One of his friends \nlives in the city where the business is located and oversees the daily operations of the \nbusiness. Applicant would travel approximately once every two months to the city where \nthe business is located to check out the operations. The business is not making a profit. \n(Tr at 21-23; Gov 3.)  \n \nUpon learning that possession of a valid Mexican passport and the investment in \nthe Mexican business might affect his security clearance status, Applicant took \nmeasures to divest himself from the business.  He has not been active in the business \nsince December 2007. He took his name off a Mexican bank account that was \nregistered to the business, and transferred his shares of the business to his two \nbusiness partners. (Tr at 23-25; AE A; AE B.) He does not intend to renew his Mexican \npassport. (Tr at 29.)       \n \nApplicant has no other business interests in Mexico. He does not own any \nproperty in Mexico. He does not possess a Mexican driver\u2019s license. He has not served \nin the Mexican military. He does not vote in Mexican elections. He receives no benefits \nfrom the Mexican government. None of his friends are involved with the Mexican \ngovernment. (Tr at 19-20, 26, 28.)   \n \nApplicant earns $96,000 a year in his current job. His loyalties are with the U.S. \nHe intends to reside in the U.S. when he retires. (Tr at 12, 20, 29.) His supervisor states \nthat Applicant is an exemplary employee who supports a difficult customer. She states \nthat Applicant goes above and beyond what is expected to provide quality service to his \ncustomers, and is a trusted member of her staff. (AE A at 2.)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG &9:       \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States.    \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Of the Foreign Preference Disqualifying Conditions (FP DC), the following \napply to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nForeign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) \u00b6 10(a) (exercise of any \nright, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or \nthrough foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) \npossession of a current foreign passport; (5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial \nor business interests in another country) and FP DC \u00b6 10(b) (action to acquire or obtain \n\n \n5 \n \n \nrecognition of a foreign citizenship by an American citizen) apply. During his security \ninvestigation, Applicant possessed a valid current Mexican passport. He applied for the \npassport in order to use his Mexican citizenship to invest in a business venture in \nMexico. It is his understanding that only Mexican citizens are allowed to invest in \nMexico.  His actions indicate that he was using his Mexican citizenship in order to open \na business in Mexico. He applied for a Mexican passport in June 2006 in order to obtain \nrecognition of his Mexican citizenship.     \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Foreign Influence. \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(a) (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in \na foreign country) does not apply. While Applicant obtained his dual citizenship based \non his parents\u2019 citizenship, he exercised his dual citizenship by applying for and using a \nMexican passport in 2006. His Mexican citizenship also allowed him to start a business \nventure in Mexico. \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated) applies.  Applicant\u2019s Mexican passport \nexpired in June 2007. It is no longer valid. He has no intention to renew his Mexican \npassport.   \n \nThe allegations concerning Applicant visiting his grandmother and several \nchildhood friends in Mexico on the weekends is not a security concern. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) His \ngrandmother is elderly. His friends are childhood friends with whom he went to \nelementary school. Applicant lives in a border city. His visits to his grandmother and \nfriends are the equivalent of driving across town with the exception that there is an \ninternational border in between.  \n \nOnce Applicant learned that possession of a foreign passport and his investment \nin the fast food business in Mexico raised a security concern, he took action to divest \nhis interest in the fast food business. Applicant earns approximately $96,000 a year in \nhis full-time job.  He depends more on his annual income as opposed to the $13,000 \ninvested in the fast food business located in Mexico. His business venture did not \nsubject him to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation. Applicant\u2019s divestment \nof the business interest located in Mexico negates any concern raised under Foreign \nPreference.  \n \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised under Foreign Preference.  \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \n\n \n6 \n \n \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Although Applicant applied for a \nMexican passport in order to open a business in Mexico with his friends, he has no \nintentions to renew his Mexican passport. His passport is expired. This was Applicant\u2019s \nfirst time applying for a security clearance. He was not aware of the security concerns \nraised by his applying for and possessing a foreign passport, and his investment in a \nforeign business. Once he discovered the issue, he took steps to mitigate those \nconcerns. He was forthcoming about all of this information during his security \nbackground investigation. Applicant has lived in the U.S. since he was in third grade. He \nattended college and graduate school in the U.S. He has no foreign financial interests. \nHe is well regarded at his current place of employment. \n \nForeign Preference security concerns are mitigated. \n  \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On April 22, 2008, DOHA assigned the case to \nme and issued a Notice of Hearing the same day. The case was heard on May 14, \n2008, as scheduled.  Department Counsel offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 into \nJune 16, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified in his case-in-chief. The record remained \nopen until May 21, 2008, to give Applicant time to submit documentary evidence. On \nMay 22, 2008, submitted three exhibits that I marked Appellant Exhibits (AE) A through \nC and were admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on May 23, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d of the SOR and offered explanations in support of his request for \neligibility for a security clearance. (Answer). His admissions are incorporated into the \nfollowing findings: \n \n \nApplicant is 24 years old and unmarried. In December 2005, he earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in finance and economics and graduated with honors. (GE 1; Tr. 19).  \nIn April 2006, he began a position as a cost/schedule analyst with his current employer, \na federal contractor. Presently, he participates in the company\u2019s Financial Leadership \nDevelopment Program, which focuses on developing the talents of specific employees \nwhom the company perceives as possessing corporate potential. (Answer). He hopes to \nbegin a master\u2019s program in the near future. (Tr. 42).  \n \n \nApplicant began occasionally consuming alcohol at the age of 17, and continued \nwhile he was in college from August 2002 to December 2005. During the first two years \nof college, he drank alcohol a couple times a week. From 2004 to 2005, he began binge \ndrinking on the weekends, a couple times a month, having six to ten drinks over the \ncourse of an evening. (Tr. 68). He admitted that at times he drank to the point of \nintoxication from 2000 to at least October 2007. (Tr. 22). \n \n \nApplicant has three incidents of alcohol-related misconduct in his background. In \nSeptember 2004, he was arrested and charged with Public Intoxication. At the time, he \nlived in a college student-housing neighborhood. He had a drink in his house and then \njoined a group of friends congregating outside. He admitted that he made an \ninappropriate comment to a security guard that was overheard by the local police. \nSubsequently, the police arrested him, along with some of his friends, and took them to \nthe police station. (Tr. 24-25). He was cited for Public Intoxication. He does not know \nthe outcome of the case because his business law professor handled the matter for him. \n \n  \nOn November 5, 2006, Applicant went to a bar to watch a football game. While \nthere, he drank several beers with a friend. They decided to leave the bar at half time \nand pick up a 12-pack of beer to take home. While driving, he drove over a curb and hit \na car. After the police arrived, he failed a sobriety test and was taken to jail. He was \ncharged with Driving While Intoxicated (DWI). He went to court on the matter in \nFebruary 2007, March 2007, and April 2007. In May 2007, he pleaded guilty to the \ncharge, a misdemeanor. The court ordered him to pay $900, sentenced him to 15 days \nof confinement, and suspended his driver\u2019s license for one year. In lieu of the 15-day \nconfinement, he performed public service over a period of weeks. His driver\u2019s license \n\n \n3 \n \n \nwas suspended from June 27, 2007, until June 27, 2008. (Tr. 78). He currently has an \noccupational license, permitting him to drive to work. (Tr. 33). After the arrest, he moved \nhome to live with his parents for a couple months and stopped consuming alcohol for a \nperiod of time. (Tr. 30). \n \n \nDuring a January 2007 interview with a government investigator regarding the \nNovember 2006 DWI, Applicant asserted that he had learned his lesson and \u201chad no \nfuture intent of repeating this behavior.\u201d (Tr. 49).  \n \n \nIn June 2007, Applicant\u2019s employer sent him to another state to help with an \nemergency project. (Tr. 34). After arriving there, he worked several long days in a row. \nOn the weekend, he traveled into the metropolitan area to attend a ball game. Prior to \nthe game, he went to a bar and had three beers. During the game, he drank four beers \nwith other people, and after the game he went to a bar where he drank another two \nbeers. He estimated that he had about nine beers that day. (Tr. 52-53). While driving \nback to the hotel, the police stopped him for speeding. He failed a field sobriety test, \ntook a Breathalyzer, and was subsequently arrested. He was charged with (1) DWI, and \n(2) Aggravated Driving While Under the Influence, at a Speed More than 30 mph in \nExcess of the Posted Speed Limit; to wit, 97 mph in a 55 mph zone. After pleading \nguilty to the DWI, the court suspended his driving privileges for three years (in that \nstate) and ordered him to enroll in an approved alcohol class. He pleaded guilty to the \nAggravated Driving charge and was fined.  He has three years in which to complete the \nalcohol class; he intends to begin it within the next month or two. (Tr. 80).  That was the   \nlast time he drank and drove. (Tr. 61). \n \n \nSince that incident, Applicant drinks minimally and less frequently. (Tr. 82). \nHowever, he admitted that he has become intoxicated on a few occasions. In 2007, he \nestimates that he drank to the point of intoxication three to four times. In March 2008, he \ncelebrated his brother\u2019s birthday at home and drank eight to ten beers over several \nhours, resulting in intoxication. (Tr. 69). In explaining the reason for drinking to excess \nthat day, he said, \u201cI let my guard down. It was not a wise thing to do by any means.\u201d (Tr. \n85).  \n \n \nApplicant is very candid and remorseful about his behavior. He does not believe \nthat he abuses alcohol or has an alcohol problem. (Tr. 73; 65). He has never been \nordered to undergo an alcohol assessment, nor has he considered obtaining one. (Tr. \n81; 89). Applicant never went to work after consuming alcohol. (Tr. 71). He has not \nmade any specific decisions regarding his future consumption of alcohol, other than he \nwill not drink and drive. (Tr. 74). His current \u201cintentions are focused more on [his] \neducation and career,\u201d rather than on alcohol. (Tr. 75).  \n \n \nApplicant submitted Performance Assessments for the years 2006 and 2007,    \nalong with a letter from his supervisor. Each Performance Assessment rates him as a \n\u201cSuccessful Contributor.\u201d (AE B and C).  Applicant\u2019s supervisor wrote \u201cHe has matured \nsignificantly in the last year and I believe he has learned from the mistakes in his \npersonal life.\u201d (AE A). His supervisor is aware of the two alcohol convictions. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \n Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuse or alcohol dependent. \nApplicant has three alcohol-related incidents in his history. In 2004, he was \narrested for Public Intoxication. In November 2006 and June 2007, he was arrested for \nDWIs. Based on those incidents, the Government raised a concern under AG \u00b6 22(a). \nApplicant admitted that from 2000 up to March 2008, he consumed alcohol at times to \nthe point of intoxication. That evidence is sufficient to raise the disqualification under AG \n\u00b6 22(c). \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation.  \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption are provided under AG \u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and, \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \nAG \u00b6 23(a) does not provide mitigation because Applicant\u2019s last DWI occurred \nless than a year ago, resulting in the suspension of his driving privileges in another state \nfor three years. At the time of the arrest, his home state driver\u2019s license was suspended \nfor a 2006 DWI. It remains suspended until the end of June 2008. His pattern of \nconsuming alcohol in each incident, viz., drinking excessively in commercial \nestablishments and then driving, does call into question his judgment. AG \u00b6 23(b) \nprovides limited mitigation. Applicant acknowledged his immature behavior and \nindicated his intention never to drink and drive again. However, there is insufficient \nevidence, at this time, to establish an adequate pattern of sobriety or responsible \ndrinking, also required under this mitigating condition. There is no evidence in the \nrecord to support the application of AG \u00b6 23(c), or AG \u00b6 23(d), which requires \nparticipation in a formalized treatment program. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including Applicant\u2019s age, and \ncandid testimony. Applicant is an intelligent and motivated 24-year-old man, who \npossesses great potential for success in his career and strong support from his \nemployer. His academic and employment accomplishments to-date are impressive. \n \nApplicant began consuming alcohol at the age of 17. He continued drinking \nduring college and gradually increased his consumption in 2004 to 2005. He \nsubsequently began to monitor the frequency of his drinking, but on numerous \noccasions engaged in binge drinking episodes. Two of those episodes led to criminal \nconvictions for DWI charges within a seven-month period of time, one in November \n2006 and another in June 2007. The second charge occurred while his resident state\u2019s \ndriver\u2019s license was suspended and one month after his final court appearance on the \nfirst charge. At the time of this hearing, he is subject to two different sets of driving \nrestrictions. \n \nAt this time, Applicant asserted that he is careful not to drink and drive. He \nexpressed his commitment to his job and a change in his behavior. He informed his \nemployer of the reasons underlying this hearing. All of these steps represent solid \nevidence of his decision to mature and continue pursuing a successful career. However, \nthis change in attitude is recent and does not sufficiently mitigate the concerns raised by \nthe Government, nor the fact that that he continues to occasionally binge drink to the \npoint of intoxication, despite his history.  \n \nAlthough he was required to complete an alcohol class, Applicant has not yet \ndone so, indicating that he may not appreciate the seriousness of the DWIs and the \neffect those convictions could have on his employment. While he appears very honest \nand dedicated to moving forward with his life, he has not established a satisfactory track \nrecord of exercising good judgment, substantiated by independent corroborating \nevidence, to persuade me that he has sufficiently matured and developed an \nunderstanding of the issues related to his pattern of binge drinking and the \nconsequences it has had in his life.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant did \nnot mitigate the security concerns arising from his alcohol consumption.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly not consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Security concerns regarding Guideline \nE (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) were mitigated.  Clearance is \ndenied.  \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on January 16, \n2006. On January 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines B, C, E \nand J for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nJune 9, 2008\n\n \n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 28, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non February 2, 2008, and I received the case assignment on February 25, 2008. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on February 27, 2008, for a hearing on March 14, 2008, and I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled.  \nAt the hearing, the government offered three exhibits (Exh.) which were admitted \nin evidence without objection. The government offered eleven official government \ndocuments for administrative notice and they were admitted without objection. Applicant \noffered no exhibits but he testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on March 24, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \nNotice \nThe hearing notice was dated 15 days before the hearing date. I advised \nApplicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the \nhearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to the 15 days notice and indicated he \nwas ready to proceed (Tr. 7).  \nPleading \n \nThe government conceded that the allegations under Guidelines E and J were \nnot proven and moved to withdraw them from consideration (Tr. 65). I approved the \nmotion to withdraw those allegations from consideration.  \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor who was born in \nIran, traveled to England in 1975 at age 19 to study and live with a brother.  He earned \nthree university degrees in England including a Ph.D in computer imagery. He became \na British citizen in 1984 and worked for a British defense contractor. He came to the \nU.S. and became a U.S. citizen in 1993. He operated his own consulting company for a \nperiod of time. He was employed by a U.S. defense contractor in 2000 and still works \nfor a successor company. His work involves developing software systems for baggage \nscanning in airports. He has not held a security clearance but needs one to advance in \nhis professional career with the company.  \n  \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that his mother, two brothers, two \nsisters, and his mother-in-law are citizens of and resident in Iran. His two brothers in \nIran are in the business of exporting fruit. A third brother lives in the U.K. and has a \nsmall business. He admitted traveling to Iran in 2000, 2005, 2006, and 2007, and \nholding an Iranian passport which he has held for many years (Tr. 25). It was set to \nexpire in 2003 and he applied for a new one which does not expire until 2008.  He \n\n \n3\nprefers to travel with the Iranian passport to Iran as use of a U.S. passport with his \nbackground raises problems for him with immigration authorities in Iran (Tr. 31). He has \noffered to place his Iranian passport in the custody of his security office to be used only \non travels to Iran but does not want to give it up or destroy it (Tr. 12).  He needs to \ntravel there every year primarily to visit his mother but he also sees his siblings while he \nis there (Tr. 40-45).  In past years his family was able to visit him in England and the \nU.S. and did so, but that is not feasible now so he must visit them in Iran if he is to see \nthem. Even though he does not hold a security clearance, he has advised cognizant \nauthorities in his company of his past travels to Iran (Tr. 30). \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in Iran, has a college degree, and works as a \npharmacist in the U.S. They have two children ages 17 and 9 who were born in the U.S.  \nThey have investments and assets in the U.S. and none in Iran. \n \nThe documents submitted for administrative notice by the government consisted \nof U.S. government reports establishing some of the following adjudicative facts.  Iran is \na theocratic Islamic republic dominated by Shia Muslim clergy. The government is \nhostile to the U.S. and has provided training, funding, and weapons to Shia political and \nmilitant groups in Iraq. The U.S. has designated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism. \nThe U.S. and international organizations are concerned about Iranian efforts to acquire \nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. Iran regards Iranian-born \nnaturalized U.S. citizens as solely Iranian citizens and expects them to enter and exit \nIran on an Iranian passport.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n\n \n4\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following with \nrespect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:  \n \n \nConditions under Guideline B that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include contact with a foreign family member who is a citizen of, or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion (AG \u00b6 7a). Based on the evidence of \nrecord, including Applicant\u2019s acknowledgment of family members living abroad, the \nGovernment established a basis for concern over foreign influence. The Applicant had \nthe burden to establish security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or \nextenuates the disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant a security clearance. ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. \n8, 2001). \n \n \nBy virtue of his relationships to the foreign family members, Applicant\u2019s contacts \ncannot be deemed casual. Mitigating conditions (MC) that might be applicable are a \n\n \n5\ndetermination that the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich the persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that \ncountry are such that is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual group or government and the \ninterests of the U.S. (AG \u00b6 8a). The other relevant MC is that the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. that he can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. (AG \u00b6 8b). Applicant\u2019s relatives live in \na country whose government is hostile to the U.S. Terrorist organizations are located in \nthe country and pose a threat in the area of the world with which the U.S. has security \ninterests. Applicant has traveled there frequently and intends to continue to do so \nimposing a very heavy burden on him to mitigate this allegation as has been repeatedly \nheld by the Appeal Board. I conclude that he has not done so. Neither mitigating \ncondition applies.  \n \n \nGuideline C: (Foreign Preference)  \n \n \nThe applicable guidelines for Foreign Preference Guideline C provide that an \nindividual who acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over \nthe United States may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are \nharmful to the interests of the United States (AG \u00b6 9). Conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying include the possession of a current foreign \npassport (AG \u00b6 10 (a) 1).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns may be mitigated by providing evidence that the passport has \nbeen destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise \ninvalidated. (AG \u00b6 11e) Applicant prefers to keep his Iranian passport and believes it \nprovides more security to him when he travels to Iran. He has traveled there almost \nannually since 2000. He intends to continue to do so in view of his family loyalties to his \nmother and siblings in Iran. His proposal to give custody of the passport to his company \nis insufficient to mitigate since he has not and does not intend to completely surrender \nthe passport to a security official. Thus, the mitigating condition is not applicable.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n\n \n6\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nApplicant is a person of substance who is well educated and ambitious. He has a \nresponsible position of trust. He provided sincere and credible testimony as to his \nrelationship with his family, his motivations, and his loyalty to the U.S. He has \nestablished a successful life here building financial ties to the U.S. He has a strong \nfinancial stake in the U.S. He has no deference to or loyalty to Iran.  However, the \nmultitude of family connections and uncertainties in a tumultuous part of the world \nwhere possibilities exist to bring pressure on Applicant leads me to conclude that it is \npremature at this time to grant a clearance to him because of the potential for pressure \nor coercion. \n \n \n \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to \nfocus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant clearance to Applicant. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions as well as the \nabove nine factors in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nWhile there is no evidence that Applicant is anything other than a loyal U.S. citizen, he  \nhas close relatives living in a country whose government has expressed hostility to the \nU.S. and seeks to harm other countries allied to the U.S. While Applicant left Iran before \nthe revolution in 1979 that brought that government to power, he, through no fault of his \nown, still has relatives living there who could be pressured into attempting to cause him \nto take action contrary to the best security interests of the U.S. He continues to hold a \npassport of Iran which is still valid. Guidelines B and C are not mitigated. Thus, he is not \neligible for a security clearance and must be denied.   \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.: Against Applicant  \n                                  \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n                                   Paragraph 2, Guideline C:AGAINSTAPPLICANT \n Subparagraph 2.a.: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b.: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c.: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d.: Against Applicant  \n \n     Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n___________________ \nCHARLES D. ABLARD \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

It is beyond the jurisdiction of these proceedings to evaluate an applicant\u2019s (otherwise permissible)\ndecisions regarding marriage and divorce. \n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 29, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On June 4, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Martin H. Mogul\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact were based upon substantial record evidence; and whether the Judge erred in his application of\nthe Guideline F mitigating conditions.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a 51 year old employee\nof a defense contractor.  He is married to his second wife, though they live separately.  He served in\nthe U.S. military from 1970 to 1980.\nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts, the amounts alleged in the SOR totaling nearly\n$64,000.  A large number of these debts were actually incurred by Applicant\u2019s wife, due to medical\nbills and to her writing checks with insufficient funds, etc.  These are debts for which Applicant is\nlegally responsible, along with his wife.   In the Analysis section of his decision, the Judge stated that\nApplicant has not demonstrated a good faith effort to resolve his debts.  Furthermore, in performing\nhis whole-person analysis, the Judge concluded that the record evidence of Applicant\u2019s debts  left\nhim with serious doubt as to Applicant\u2019s fitness for a clearance.   We have examined the Judge\u2019s\nfindings in light of the record as a whole.  The Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are\nbased upon substantial record evidence.  See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch\nrelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of\nall the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d)   \nWe have considered Applicant\u2019s arguments on appeal and conclude that, to the extent that\nthe Judge\u2019s decision contains error, it is harmless in that, even if such error did not occur, the Judge\nwould have decided the case in the same way.   See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 06-07247 at 2 (App. Bd.\n1\nFeb. 13, 2008).  The Judge has drawn \u201ca rational connection between the facts found\u201d and his\nultimate adverse security clearance decision, both as regards the Guideline F mitigating conditions\nand the whole-person analysis.   See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  See\nalso Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

This debt has not been resolved.\nApplicant explained that the primary reason for his outstanding debt is the many\nmedical bills incurred by his wife from the vehicular accident in which she was involved.\nWhile Applicant has been separated from his wife since approximately 2000 or 2001, he\nis still legally married to her. He contended that he was not aware for many years that\nshe was incurring all of these debts. He contacted some of the creditors to tell them he\nwas separated from his wife, but he was informed that since he was still legally married\nto his wife, he  was still responsible for debts that she has incurred. \nWhen Applicant was asked why he did not file for divorce from his wife so he\ncould stop being responsible for her continuing overdue debts, he testified that he has\n\n6\nbeen unable to afford to file for divorce, but he does plan to do so in the future. Because\nhe remains legally married to his wife, he will be legally responsible for debts she\naccumulates in the future.\nApplicant also was unemployed or underemployed for periods of time, partially\ndue to health issues, which contributed to his indebtedness. \nFinally, Applicant testified his income covers his phone, rent, truck and his\ninsurance. He has very little left after paying these debts. \nApplicant offered into evidence two letters from individuals who know him in his\nprofessional capacity (Exhibits D and E). They spoke in laudatory terms, describing him\nas a dedicated Security Officer, and someone who is honest and devoted to protecting\nclassified information. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n7\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19 (a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), a history of not meeting financial obligations\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and was\nunable to pay these debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying\nconditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 (b), it may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. As noted above, the\nfinancial problems arose primarily from Applicant\u2019s former wife incurring significant\n\n8\nmedical bills over the course of several years. However, I can not find that this\nMitigating Condition applies since Applicant has not acted responsibly since he has\nmade no effort to legally end his marriage with his wife, despite being separated from\nher for more than five years.  As long as Applicant remains married to his wife, he will\nlegally be responsible for all of the bills that she has incurred and will incur in the future.\nAlso, while he has contacted some of these creditors, I can not find that Mitigating\nCondition (d) is applicable since Applicant has not yet begun to make a good faith effort\nto resolve and repay most of these overdue debts.\n l find that Applicant is not yet financially sound and prepared for future\ncontingencies. I conclude that he has not mitigated the financial concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why Mitigating Conditions (b) and (d) do not apply, considered with the\ntremendous amount of overdue debt and Applicant\u2019s failure to take action so that he\nwould no longer be responsible for his wife\u2019s future indebtedness, I find that the record\nevidence leaves me with considerable questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility\nand suitability for a security clearance under the whole person concept. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant \n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.v:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.w:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.x:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.y:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.z:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.aa:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.bb:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.cc:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.dd:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.ee:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.ff:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.gg:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.hh:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.ii:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.jj:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.kk:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.ll:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.mm:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.nn:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.oo:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.pp:\nAgainst Applicant \n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 6, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable finding under Guideline F is not at issue on appeal.\n1\n2\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On July 30, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Michael H. Leonard denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding\nApplicant had deliberately falsified his security clearance application; and whether the Judge\u2019s\nadverse clearance decision under Guideline E is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.1\n \n(1) Applicant argues that he did not deliberately falsify three different questions on his\nsecurity clearance application by failing to disclose the fact that he had six debts totaling\napproximately $38,000 that were currently more than 90 or 180 days delinquent, and that he had\nbeen a party to a civil action for damages in excess of $15,000.  In support of that argument, he\nessentially asserts that the Judge was required to accept, as a matter of law, his explanation that he\nbelieved he did not need to disclose that information in response to the questions.  Applicant\u2019s\nargument in this regard does not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nA review of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that he considered Applicant\u2019s explanation for\nwhy he failed to disclose the information in question.  The Judge was not bound, as a matter of law,\nto accept or reject Applicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light\nof the record evidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s\nomission was deliberate and intentional.  Given the plain language of the questions at issue and the\ntotality of the record evidence, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had deliberately falsified his\nsecurity clearance application is sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-02163 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb.\n28, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-16159 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 10, 2008).\n(2) Applicant also contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the\nJudge did not give adequate weight to the mitigating evidence, including his outstanding work\nperformance and his favorable community ties.  Again, Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate\nthat the Judge erred. \nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\n\n3\nA review of the decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered\nby Applicant against the recency and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the\npossible application of relevant mitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  He found in favor\nof Applicant under Guideline F.  However, he reasonably explained why the evidence which the\nApplicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s other security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs.

An applicant with\ngood or exemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has negative security implications.\nThe Guidelines set forth in the Directive address a variety of examples of conduct and circumstances\nwhich are a security concern to the government and require a whole-person analysis to determine an\napplicant\u2019s security eligibility.  A whole-person analysis is by its very nature not confined to the\nworkplace.  See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 03-19006 at 6 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, 2005).

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on March 6, 2008. The SOR is equivalent to\nan administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues in\nthis case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of\nfinancial problems and Guideline E for personal conduct (falsification of a security-\nclearance application). For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided against\nApplicant. \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nJuly 30, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.7 (authorizing department counsel to request a hearing within 20 days of\n3\nreceipt of an applicant\u2019s answer). \n Directive, \u00b6 2.2 (by mutual agreement, the Directive extends to other federal agencies, including the State\n4\nDepartment). \n2\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR was received on April 3, 2008, and he\nrequested a decision without a hearing. The government exercised its prerogative under\nthe Directive and timely requested a hearing (Appellate Exhibit I).  The case was\n3\nassigned to me on May 19, 2008. The hearing took place as scheduled on June 24,\n2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on July 2, 2008.\nThe record was left open until July 18, 2008, to allow Applicant an opportunity to\nsubmit additional documentary evidence. He did so, and those matters are admitted,\nwithout objections, as follows: (1) Exhibit E\u2013cover sheet and letter; (2) Exhibit F\u2013letter\nfrom clerk of court; and (3) Exhibit G\u2013TransUnion investigative response to dispute. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges six delinquent debts for a total of about\n$38,000. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant gave deliberately false\nanswers to three questions when he completed a security-clearance application in\n2006. His Answer was mixed. He admitted with explanation three of the debts and\ndenied with explanation three debts concerning medical services. He admitted that he\ngave incorrect answers, but explained that his answers were not deliberately false.\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for\nhis current employer since May 2006; his position or title is project manager. He works\nin the field of automatic fire protection, and he is seeking an industrial security clearance\nfor the first time so he can perform duties as a fire inspector at U.S. embassies.  \n4\nApplicant is currently married to his fourth wife. His first two marriages ended in\ndivorce. His third marriage ended in 2001 when his wife passed away due to a terminal\n\n3\nillness (cancer). He married his fourth wife in 2002, and he is currently separated. He is\nthe father of four children, two adults and two minors. The two minor children, ages 9\nand 16, live with him. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. The six debts alleged in the SOR\nare addressed below.\nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d are for credit card accounts for about $2,375\nand $860 with the same creditor that were charged off in about 2001\u20132003. Applicant\nresolved the debts in March 2008 when he agreed to settle with a collection agency for\n$800 (Exhibit A; Tr. 39\u201342, 46).\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e is for a credit card account for about $6,048 that was\nplaced for collection in about 2003. Applicant resolved this debt in about March 2007\nwhen he agreed to settle with a collection agency that had brought a lawsuit in about\n2006 or 2007 (Exhibit B; Tr. 46\u201352). It was settled for $4,750.  \nThe three debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.f for $270, $672, and $27,580 are\naddressed together because the debts are based on medical services provided to\nApplicant\u2019s late wife. Applicant disputes liability for these debts because he believes the\nhospital was paid in full via medical insurance (Exhibits 3 and C). He disputed these\nitems through credit reporting agencies (Exhibits D and E). It appears the dispute was\nsuccessful as those matters were deleted or no longer appear on his credit report\n(Exhibit G).\nIn 2003, Applicant was sued in state court on a matter related to the medical care\nfor his late wife (Exhibits 3 and C). The complaint alleged damages in excess of\n$15,000 because Applicant engaged in wrongful conduct when he received payment\nfrom his insurer that he failed and refused to pay for care provided to his wife. Applicant,\nwithout legal counsel, filed a response or answer to the lawsuit (Exhibit C). Thereafter,\nhe  never heard anything further about the lawsuit and assumed it was dropped. In his\npost-hearing submission, Applicant provided a letter from a court official who stated that\na record name search was conducted and that as of July 15, 2008, Applicant does not\nhave a civil judgment recorded against him in that county (Exhibit F).    \nApplicant completed a security-clearance application in July 2006 (Exhibit 1). In\ndoing so, he was required to answer several questions about his financial record\n(Questions 27\u201329). He answered all of the questions in the negative, thereby denying\nany derogatory financial information within the scope of the questions. In particular, he\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to the following three questions:\n\u2022\nQuestion 28a\u2013In the last seven years, have you been over 180 days delinquent\non any debt(s)?\n\u2022\nQuestion 28b\u2013Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts?\n\u2022\nQuestion 29\u2013In the last seven years, have you been a party to any public record\ncivil court actions not listed elsewhere on the application?\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n5\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n6\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n7\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n8\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n10\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n11\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n12\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n13\n4\nHe did not report any of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR in response to\nQuestions 28a and 28b. Likewise, he did not report the 2003 civil lawsuit in state court\nthat sought damages in excess of $15,000 in response to Question 29. No mention of\nthese matters was made anywhere in his security-clearance application. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.5\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n6\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n7\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n8\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n9\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n10\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n11\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n12\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.13\n\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n14\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n15\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n16\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n17\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n18\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n19\n5\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.14\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n15\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n16\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n17\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting\n18\nfinancial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more\n19\nthan sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions.  \n\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n20\nconditions).  \n6\nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns:\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\n \nAll of the mitigating conditions have been considered, and MC 2, MC 4, and MC\n5 apply in Applicant\u2019s favor. It appears that the majority of Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems, as alleged in the SOR, were related to the terminal illness of his wife.\nApplicant has settled the three charged-off credit card accounts and he has disputed the\nthree debts for medical services. On balance, this is sufficient evidence to mitigate the\nsecurity concern under Guideline F.\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and\n20\ncredible adverse information that may not be enough to support action under any other\nguideline. In particular, a security concern may arise due to:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\n\n Revised Guidelines at 10.\n21\n DC 1 is the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\n22\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\n7\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n21\nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An\nomission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely\nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely\nthought the information did not need to be reported. \nThe gravamen of the SOR is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answers to Questions\n28a, 28b, and 29 in his security-clearance application, as it is clear that he did not report\ninformation that was called for by the three questions. He denies that his responses to\nquestions were intentionally false.\nFor Questions 28a and 28b concerning financial delinquencies, he explained that\nhe was thinking about current debts and did not understand the questions to be asking if\nhe had \u201cever not paid a debt\u201d and that he was not trying to hide anything as he knew his\ncredit would be checked (Answer). For Question 29 concerning civil court actions, he\nexplained that he assumed the 2003 lawsuit was not legitimate since he heard nothing\nfrom the plaintiff after he filed his answer to the lawsuit, and that he was not trying to\ndeliberately mislead anyone on his security-clearance application (Answer). In other\nwords, he believed he did not have to report it because it was not a legitimate lawsuit. In\nhis hearing testimony, he essentially reaffirmed these explanations (Tr. 60\u201363).   \nHaving had the opportunity to listen to his testimony and observe his demeanor, I\nconclude that his contentions and explanations are not credible. It is simply too difficult\nto believe that a man of his age and experience could genuinely believe that it was\ncorrect and proper to submit a security-clearance application without mentioning his\nderogatory financial record given the extraordinary medical expenses for his late wife\nalong with the related civil lawsuit that was brought against him in 2003. The record\nevidence does not persuade me that Applicant misunderstood the questions, genuinely\nthought the information did not need to be reported, or made honest mistakes in\nanswering the questions. His explanations are after-the-fact rationalizations. But the\nrecord evidence does support a conclusion that he deliberately omitted, concealed, or\nfalsified material facts in response to Questions 28a, 28b, and 29.   \n22\nAll of the MC under Guideline E have been reviewed and none apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. Making false statements to the federal government during the\nsecurity-clearance process is serious misconduct, and it is not easily explained away,\nextenuated, or mitigated. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided against Applicant. \n\n8\nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the personal conduct security concern. Applicant did not meet his ultimate\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this\nconclusion, the whole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis\ndoes not support a favorable decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.f:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.a\u20132.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

On February 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guidelines J, D, and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 17, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge.

After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old Information Release Officer, who has been employed \nby a defense contractor since August 2005. GE 1. He previously held a security \nclearance when employed as a compliance specialist by a Government agency from \nJanuary 2003 to May 2005. In May 2005, he resigned from that position after being \ncharged with sexual abuse and simple assault in lieu of being involuntarily terminated, \ndiscussed infra. Applicant. GE 1. He seeks a security clearance because there are \noccasions where \u201cit would be very useful to have one.\u201d Tr. 176. \n \nApplicant completed his undergraduate studies in April 2002, and was awarded a \nBachelor of Arts degree. He attended graduate school from September 2002 to May \n2004, and was awarded a Master\u2019s Degree. GE 1, Tr. 172-173. Applicant was married \nfrom May 2001 to December 2004. That marriage ended by divorce. He has no \ndependents. GE 1. \n \nThe thrust of this case centers on an incident that occurred in August 2003 in a \nmajor metropolitan area. While walking to work, Applicant noticed a young woman who \nhe found \u201cattractive\u201d and stated \u201cI wanted to go up and talk to her, get to know her.\u201d Tr. \n105. Applicant said \u201chello and talked to her for a moment and she turned around and \nthat was when I \u2013 that was when I groped her (breast).\u201d Tr. 106, 108. After being \ngroped, she reacted, \u201cWhat the [expletive deleted] are you doing?\u201d Tr. 107. Referring to \nwhat happened next, Applicant testified, \u201cWell I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s \nnothing personal.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a stupid thing to say in hindsight, but that was what I said.\u201d Tr. \n108. Applicant initially ran \u201ca few paces\u201d and continued on to work. At that time, no law \nenforcement involvement occurred because Applicant left the scene before the victim \ncould summon the authorities. Tr. 109. \n \nIn May 2004, the victim later saw Applicant near the location where the incident \noccurred. This time, she was successful in summoning the police. Applicant was \nconfronted by the police, and was interviewed and photographed. Later that month, the \npolice issued an arrest warrant and Applicant was charged with sexual abuse and \n\n \n \n3\nsimple assault. In November 2004, Applicant appeared in court and the sexual abuse \ncharge was dismissed, and he was convicted of simple assault pursuant to his guilty \nplea. He was sentenced to 6 months incarceration, which was suspended, 18 months \nprobation, 60 hours of community service, 6 months mandatory behavioral counselling \nand ordered to pay approximately $250 in fines and court costs. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 2.a., \n3.a.). GE 6 \u2013 8. \n \nIn May 2005, as a result of his arrest and conviction discussed supra, Applicant \nresigned in lieu of being terminated from his job as a compliance specialist with a \nGovernment agency. (SOR \u00b6 3.b.). Tr. 71-72. \n \nApplicant\u2019s immediate supervisor testified on his behalf. He stated he has been \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor for three years, that he knows him well, and has written three \nevaluations on Applicant, which were all commendable, i.e. \u201ccommendable, exceptional \nbeing the top.\u201d He found Applicant to have many good qualities to include honesty and \ndependability. He added that he was familiar with Applicant\u2019s past and the underlying \nfacts in the SOR, and in spite of Applicant\u2019s past supports him for a security clearance. \nTr. 24-37. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father testified on his behalf. He stated he and his wife were present \nto support their son. He described the relationship with his son as \u201cclose,\u201d and they \nshare many interests. In that regard, he stated that Applicant informed him of all aspects \nregarding his May 2004 charges. He has counselled his son \u201cto do the right thing,\u201d and \n\u201cdeal with the consequences of the actions that he had done.\u201d He stated their family has \nbeen and remains very involved with their Church, and that their Church has been a \nsignificant source of support for Applicant during this process. Based on how well he \nknows his son, the fact this incident occurred over four years ago, and the progress \nApplicant has made, Applicant\u2019s father believes Applicant has put this incident behind \nhim. He communicates with his son by telephone. Tr. 37-52. \n \nApplicant\u2019s former girlfriend testified on his behalf. She met him at Church and \ndated him for approximately six months in 2005. She began dating him while he was on \nprobation, and stated Applicant informed her of his past assault on their first date. She \nwas initially taken aback, but proceeded with caution. She stated that while she and \nApplicant were dating, he did not give her any reason to feel uncomfortable nor did she \nnotice anything unusual about his behavior. She has remained friends with Applicant \nsince they stopped dating. Tr. 52-68. \n \nApplicant spoke of the important role his Church has played and continues to \nplay in his life. Applicant was precluded from attending his Church from August 2004 to \nNovember 2007 as a result of this incident. As a precondition of being allowed to return \nto Church, he met with his Church leaders, came to terms with his actions, repented, \nand took the necessary corrective action to ensure he did not make the same mistakes \nagain. One of the preconditions of being allowed to return to Church was to meet with \nhis therapist, who communicated with Church leaders regarding Applicant\u2019s progress. \nTr. 68-78. \n\n \n \n4\n \nIn March 2004, Applicant was involved in an incident similar to the one that \noccurred in August 2003. His in-laws took him and his then-wife to a vacation in Mexico \naround the time they were completing graduate school. While on vacation and out of the \npresence of his in-laws and wife, Applicant groped an 18-year-old woman on her breast \nhe met at their hotel. He stated he did so \u201cimpulsively\u201d and that he \u201cwas not acting on \n[his] best judgment.\u201d The woman reported her being groped by Applicant to the hotel \nmanagement, who in turn reported the incident to his in-laws and wife. Applicant stated \n\u201cthings fell apart from that point.\u201d After this incident, Applicant and his wife separated \nand eventually divorced. Tr. 78-84, 130-132. \n \nAfter Applicant\u2019s wife left, he sought counselling in April 2004 and continued with \ncounselling until February 2008. Applicant\u2019s therapist diagnosed him with \u201cImpulse \nControl Disorder NOS 312.3 (due to ego-dystonic involvement with pornography); \nPartner Relationship Problems V61.10; r/o depression.\u201d GE 3. He initially started \ncounselling in a group format, which he participated for \u201cabout a year\u201d and then \nswitched to individual counselling. Applicant\u2019s therapist informed him he was moving \nfrom the area and the decision to terminate counselling was \u201cmutual.\u201d Applicant stated \nwhile employed by the Government agency, he held a top secret clearance, which was \nlater upgraded to sensitive compartmented information. He held a clearance during the \n2003 and 2004 groping incidents. Tr. 84-88, 90, 95-96. \n \n \nApplicant provided the following explanation regarding how he could engage in \nsuch behavior given his background: \n \nYou know, when I look at it now I don\u2019t know the answer to that question. I \nknow that at the time I was \u2013 I was not acting in my best judgment. I felt \u2013 \nfelt isolated in the marriage relationship. I was ashamed of the struggles \nthat I was having in my marriage. \n \nI knew that I was not living up to the standards of the Church, and I got \ncaught in, you know, a bit of a downward spiral that culminated with this \nincident. \n \nAnd if I could go back and reverse those decisions, I absolutely would, but \nthe best that I could do was to exert my full effort into recovering, taking \nresponsibility for what I did.  \n \nI wanted to save the marriage relationship, but I had made decisions that \nhad taken it out of my hands. My wife was not \u2013 she didn\u2019t want to \ncontinue with that. And, looking back, I don\u2019t blame her. Tr. 88-89. \n \nOn cross examination, Department Counsel reviewed Applicant\u2019s counseling \nrecords with him. Applicant acknowledged there were several additional \u201cincidents\u201d that \noccurred in addition to the two incidents already identified. When pressed for a number, \nApplicant conceded there were \u201c[m]ore than three, less than ten.\u201d Tr. 117. These other \nincidents occurred on public transportation or on the street. Tr. 118. Applicant testified \nhe has gotten over his fetish with breasts, which was identified in his counseling records \n\n \n \n5\nin July 2004. GE 3, Tr. 132. Applicant\u2019s counseling records also identified his having \nsent text messages to women regarding their breasts and having been with a woman, \nwho worked for an escort service. GE 3, Tr. 133-136. The counseling records also \nreported that that Applicant was being treated for issues pertaining to being \u201csober as it \npertains to pornography\u201d and ongoing issues with nocturnal masturbation. GE 3, Tr. \n139-140. The counseling records document four years of therapy, which Department \nCounsel queried the Applicant about at some length. These records document a \nnumber of sexually related issues that Applicant had discussed with his therapist, and \nhow these problems affected his ability to function as a well adjusted responsible \nmember of society. GE 3, Tr. 132-171. \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Final Summary Report from this therapist dated June 13, \n2008, which is summarized in part: \n \n1. Applicant initiated therapy in April 2004 for problems with his personal life, \nincluding his marriage, feelings of depression, and compulsive sexual \nbehaviors that involved groping women\u2019s breasts. \n \n2. Applicant was diagnosed with Impulse Control Disorder, NOS, DSM IV code \n313.30.  \n \n3. His treatment involved twice monthly individual and weekly group \npsychotherapy sessions for about 24 months. The individual counseling was \nlater reduced to monthly sessions.  \n \n4. Applicant\u2019s therapy continued until February 2008, primarily as a result of his \ntherapist moving out of state, but also due to mutual agreement that the work \nof psychotherapy had concluded. The therapist determined it was \nunnecessary to refer Applicant to another local psychotherapeutic recourse. \nAE B. \n \nApplicant submitted a signed, sworn statement from a religious leader from his \nChurch. This religious leader has known Applicant since June 2005, and dealt with \nApplicant after he had been \u201cdisfellowshipped\u201d through a Church disciplinary council. He \nmet with Applicant from June 2005 to November 2007 in his capacity as a religious \nleader. He concluded by stating Applicant had atoned for his actions and made the \nrequisite changes in his life to avoid past bad behavior. He found Applicant to \ndependable, honest and trustworthy and believes Applicant would be a positive \nresponsible and loyal employee to any employer including the U.S. Government. AE C. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n \n6\n                                                          \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d1 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).2 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n \n1 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less \nthan the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the \nevidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. \nFederal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but \nless than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n2 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n \n\n \n \n7\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nConclusions \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the Guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nThe Government established its case under Guideline J by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and evidence presented that Applicant was issued an arrest warrant in May \n2004 that he was charged with sexual abuse and simple assault in May 2004, and was \nconvicted pursuant to his guilty plea of simple assault in November 2004, and \nsentenced. \n \nOf the six Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions listed under AG  \u00b6 31, two \nare applicable: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  \n \nOf the five Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions listed under AG \u00b6 32, two are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n8\nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \nThe security concern relating to the Guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in \nAG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual. \n \nThe Government established its case under Guideline D by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and evidence presented that Applicant sexually abused a woman in a \npublic area in August 2003. \nOf the four Sexual Behavior Disqualifying Conditions listed under AG \u00b6 13, four \nare applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior \nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a \npersonality disorder; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment. \nOf the four Sexual Behavior Mitigating Conditions listed under AG \u00b6 14, two are \npotentially applicable: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the Guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n\n \n \n9\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nThe Government established its case under Guideline E by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and evidence presented that he sexually abused a woman in a public area \nwhile holding a security clearance, and that he resigned in lieu of being terminated from \nhis Government position as a result of conduct, described supra, in May 2005. \n \nOf the seven Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions listed under \u00b6 AG 15, \none is applicable: \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, . . .  . \n \nOf the seven Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions listed under AG \u00b6 17, two \nare potentially applicable: \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant\u2019s arrest warrant issued in May 2004 following his sexual abuse of a \nwoman in a public area in August 2003 brought to the forefront his criminal conduct, \nsexual behavior, and personal conduct concerns. However, the evidence developed a \nmuch broader account than a single incident of groping on a public street. Not long after \nApplicant\u2019s groping incident in August 2003, he groped a woman\u2019s breast while on \nvacation with his wife and in-laws.  \n \nDuring cross examination, Department Counsel uncovered more incidents than \nthe two already identified. He gleaned from Applicant that he had been involved with \nmore than three, but less than ten similar incidents that occurred on public \ntransportation or on the street. Applicant\u2019s therapy records document a four-year \nstruggle to overcome not only Applicant\u2019s infatuation with breasts and socially \nunacceptable behavior, but also other sexually dysfunctional issues. His therapy \nrecently ended in February 2008, and although ended in part by \u201cmutual agreement,\u201d \nthe primary reason was prompted as a result of Applicant\u2019s therapist moving out of \nstate.  \n\n \n \n10\n                                                          \n \nApplicant\u2019s counseling records note in great detail the groping incidents and \nother sexually dysfunctional problems that have plagued him. To Applicant\u2019s credit, he \nhas made great strides in coming to terms with his past, and has the good fortune of \nhaving very supportive parents and a Church community that he has reconnected with. \nHowever, the repetitive nature of Applicant\u2019s reprehensible conduct and the extremely \npoor judgment he exercised while holding a security clearance causes me to have \nserious doubts whether it is in the best interest of national security to grant Applicant a \nsecurity clearance. It is noteworthy from Applicant\u2019s testimony that his strong levels of \nreligious and family influence failed to prevent his inappropriate conduct. \n \n \nI find the facts warrant application of all the Disqualifying Conditions listed, supra. \nThe only Mitigating Conditions listed supra that I find partially applicable are those under  \nAGs \u00b6\u00b6 32(d), 17(d) and 17(e). Applicant has acknowledged his behavior and did obtain \ncounseling; however, I am reluctant to accept the notion such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur given the fact Applicant recently terminated therapy. Further time is required to \nevaluate Applicant\u2019s behavior. Applicant\u2019s family, employer, and some of friends are \naware of his past.  \n \nI am required to consider Applicant\u2019s overall questionable behavior when \nevaluating the seriousness of the conduct alleged in the SOR to determine factors such \nas the extent to which his behavior is recent; the likelihood of recurrence; Applicant\u2019s \nexplanations concerning the circumstances of the incidents alleged; and his \nrehabilitation.3 \n \n \nUnder the totality of the circumstances, I find Applicant\u2019s behavior is relatively \nrecent and not isolated. Considering his past behavior, the nature and seriousness of \nhis misconduct, and his unwillingness to avoid unlawful and/or unacceptable conduct \nover a period of time, I find his favorable information is not sufficient to mitigate \nGuidelines J, D, and E security concerns. His behavior raises questions about his ability \nand willingness to follow the law, and ultimately, to protect classified information. His \nconduct in which he exercised extremely poor judgment on a number of occasions, \nspanning a several year period, weighs against a finding of rehabilitation and positive \nbehavioral changes.  \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the security concerns raised. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the \nwhole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support a \nfavorable decision. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d4 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has \n \n3 ISCR Case No. 04-09959 at 3 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006). \n \n4 See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n \n11\nnot mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he \nis not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline D: \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  \n \n     Subparagraph 2.a.: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  \n \n      Subparagraph 3.a.: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n  \n \n      Subparagraph 3.b.: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nROBERT J.

On October 9, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).

Facts\nThe Judge made the following relevant factual findings: Applicant is a 38-year old chemical\nengineer.  He married in 1999 and has a 5-year old daughter and another child on the way.  Applicant\nused marijuana several times a year at social gatherings during his college years, from 1988 to 1994.\nBetween 1994 and 1999, he is not sure if he used marijuana, but if he did so, it was once or twice\na year.  From 1999 until his last use in 2005 or 2006, he used it once every other year\u2014at least seven\ntimes.  Applicant admitted his marijuana use when he completed a security clearance application in\nJanuary 2007.  When interviewed by an investigator in June 2007, Applicant indicated that he\nintended to continue using marijuana in the future.

The Board will\naddress this contention below. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n\n\u201c[T]he behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\n1\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement;\u201d Directive \u00b6\nE2.26(a).\n3\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate\nmitigating conditions.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply\nto the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion\nin light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.\n20, 2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nThe Judge found that the government had met its burden under Guideline H and that the\n\u201ctotality of this evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of\nthe Applicant.\u201d  Decision at 5.  However, the Judge then applied Mitigating Condition 26(a),  stating\n1\nthat Applicant had not used marijuana in over two years and that he \u201ccredibly testified that he has\nno intentions of ever using any illegal drug in the future.\u201d  Id.  \nAs Department Counsel points out, the Judge overlooked significant evidence in making that\nstatement and in mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct.  As discussed above, Applicant indicated his\nintention to continue to use marijuana in his June 2007 interview with an investigator.  In August\n\n4\n2007, DOHA sent Applicant a copy of the statement he made to the investigator.  He was asked to\nauthenticate it and was given an opportunity to add additional information.  In his response dated\nSeptember 5, 2007, he clarified one aspect of the statement, but did not address his statement that\nhe would continue to use marijuana in the future.  Then in his answer to the SOR in October,\nApplicant denied that he intended to continue using it.  A major part of Applicant\u2019s testimony at the\nhearing revolved around the difference between Applicant\u2019s statement in June and his statement to\nthe contrary in October.  The Judge does not refer to that conflict in her decision, merely stating that\nApplicant \u201ccredibly testified\u201d about his intentions not to use drugs, as set forth above.  The Board\nhas held that while a Judge\u2019s credibility determination is entitled to deference, such an assessment\ndoes not relieve the Judge of the obligation to decide how much weight can properly be given to an\napplicant\u2019s testimony in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-02486\nat 7 (App. Bd. Aug. 31, 2004), citing Anderson v. City of Bessemer, 470 U.S. 564, 575 (1985).  A\nJudge\u2019s decision is not measured by a standard of perfection, but the credibility of Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony of changed intent toward the future use of drugs is a critical aspect of the case.  Given the\nself-serving nature of Applicant\u2019s statements of future intent starting in October 2007, as well as\nrecord evidence of Applicant\u2019s prior use while serving in other positions subject to drug testing, it\nis not reasonable for the Judge to merely accept the credibility of statements of future intent without\na clear explanation of why she  found it credible. \nThe Judge also overlooked record evidence regarding Applicant\u2019s drug use following drug\ntests in the past.  Applicant testified that he passed an initial drug test with his current employer and\nhas not used marijuana since.  However, he also stated that all the jobs he held in the past required\ndrug tests, and he continued to use marijuana after passing initial drug tests while holding those jobs.\nTranscript at 28.  In another case involving intent to use drugs in the future, the Board stated:  \u201cAs\na matter of common sense, one would expect that a person who has taken a drug test as a condition\nof employment would understand the importance of future abstention.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 06-18270\nat 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  Here again, the Judge relied on Applicant\u2019s current statement that he\nno longer intends to use marijuana and overlooked significant record evidence to the contrary. \n \nDepartment Counsel correctly points out the Judge also overlooked significant record\nevidence in  her whole-person analysis.  The Judge concluded that Applicant has matured in the two\nyears since he last used marijuana, that he now has family responsibilities, and will do nothing to\njeopardize his career.  However, the record indicates that Applicant continued to use marijuana after\nhis marriage in 1999 and the birth of his first child, who is now five years old.  \nViewed in light of the record as a whole, the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is not sustainable.\n\n5\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael D.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact, below. FINDINGS OF FACT The Applicant is 38 years old and married. He has a Bachelors Degree in Chemical Engineering. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Quality Engineer, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement). The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs. The Applicant admitted that he has used marijuana approximately on an annual or bi-annual basis from 1988 until the summer of 2006. He has never purchased or sold marijuana or used any other illegal drug. (See Government Exhibit 2). The Applicant explained that he first used marijuana while in college, in 1988. He used it at parties or social gatherings several times a year. This use continued, once or twice a year, until he graduated in 1994. From 1994 to 1999, he does not remember if he used it, but at the most it was once or twice a year. From 1999 until his last use in 2005 or 2006, he used it once every other year, or at least seven times. His college friends that he used marijuana with have moved away and so he only sees them when they visit about once every three years or so. (Tr. pp. 22-25). In January 5, 2007, the Applicant completed a security clearance application wherein he revealed his illegal marijuana use. (See Government Exhibit 1).

On October 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the\nApplicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an\nAdministrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 30, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to\nthe undersigned on December 6, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on December\n17, 2007, scheduling the hearing for January 15, 2008.  At the hearing the Government\npresented four exhibits.  The Applicant presented no exhibits, nor called any witnesses.\nHe did testify on his own behalf.  The record remained open after the hearing to allow\n\n2\nthe Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation.  He submitted one\nPost-Hearing Exhibit consisting of five pages.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received\non January 23, 2008.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof an excerpt on Marijuana from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration dated\nNovember 27, 2007, and a publication on Marijuana from the U.S. Department of Health\nand Human Services, National Institute of Heath, National Institute on Drug Abuse\ndated July 2005.  The request and the attached documents were not admitted into\nevidence but were included in the record as Government Exhibits 3 and 4.  The facts\nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 38 years old and married.  He has a Bachelors Degree in\nChemical Engineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Quality Engineer,\nand is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs.\nThe Applicant admitted that he has used marijuana approximately on an annual\nor bi-annual basis from 1988 until the summer of 2006.  He has never purchased or sold\nmarijuana or used any other illegal drug.  (See Government Exhibit 2).   \nThe Applicant explained that he first used marijuana while in college, in 1988.  He\nused it at parties or social gatherings several times a year.  This use continued, once or\ntwice a year, until he graduated in 1994.  From 1994 to 1999, he does not remember if\nhe used it, but at the most it was once or twice a year.  From 1999 until his last use in\n2005 or 2006, he used it once every other year, or at least seven times.  His college\nfriends that he used marijuana with have moved away and so he only sees them when\nthey visit about once every three years or so.  (Tr. pp. 22-25).     \nIn January 5, 2007, the Applicant completed a security clearance application\nwherein he revealed his illegal marijuana use.  (See Government Exhibit 1).  A\nstatement of an interview of the Applicant conducted on June 25, 2007, prepared by the\nSpecial Agent from the Defense Security Service, indicates that the Applicant intends\non continuing his pattern of marijuana use in the future.  The Applicant explained that he\nwas very uncomfortable during the interview and in response to the question said, \u201cI\nguess so\u201d in the affirmative instead of clarifying himself.  (See Government Exhibit 2).  \n\n3\nIn his answer to the SOR, dated October 30, 2007, however, the Applicant\ndenied the fact that he intends to continue using marijuana.      \nThe Applicant stopped using marijuana in 2006, about the time he started\nworking for a defense contractor.  He understands the law and DoD policy that prohibits\nthe use of illegal drugs.  (See Government Exhibits 3 and 4).  He has decided to commit\nhimself to a drug free lifestyle.    \nThe Applicant married in 1999.  He has a five year old daughter and another\nchild on the way.  He regrets using marijuana in the past, is embarrassed by it, and has\nno intentions of ever using it again.\nThe Applicant\u2019s performance appraisal for the period from January 2007 through\nDecember 2007 reflects that he either \u201cmeets performance requirements\u201d or \u201cexceeds\nperformance requirements\u201d in every category.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\n24.  The Concern.  Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n25.(a) any drug abuse;\n25.(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n26.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n\n4\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about th his performance evaluation reflects\nthat he is a valuable asset to his company e person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\n\n5\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in drug abuse that demonstrates poor judgment or\nunreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has  engaged in drug involvement (Guideline H).  The totality of this evidence\nindicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\nBecause of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus\nor connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guideline H of the SOR.\nUnder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, disqualifying conditions, 25(a) any drug\nabuse, 25(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution or possession of drug paraphernalia, and 22(g) any illegal\ndrug use after being granted a security clearance apply.  However, mitigating condition\n26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment also applies.  Applicant\u2019s history of\nmarijuana use started in college and continued until 2006, on an annual or semi-annual\nbasis until he became employed in his field of study, that of an Engineer.  Applicant\u2019s\nlast use of  marijuana occurred in 2006, over two years ago.  He credibly testified that\nhe has no intentions of ever using any illegal drug in the future.  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept by considering the totality of\nthe Applicant\u2019s conduct and all of the circumstances, using the nine adjudicative\nprocess factors listed above.  Over the past two years, the Applicant has grown up,\nmatured and realizes his mistakes of the past.  He has a family now and the\nresponsibilities that go along with it.  His performance evaluation reflects that he is a\nvaluable asset to his company.  He now understands the privilege and seriousness of\nholding a security clearance and will do nothing to jeopardize it.  Under the particular\nfacts of this case, I do not find his past use of marijuana to be recent or of security\nsignificance (factor A(3)), and that the likelihood of recurrence is close to nil (factor\nA(8)).      \n\n6\n This Applicant has demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and that he meets the\neligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find for the\nApplicant under Guideline H (Drug Involvement). \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1 of the SOR.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn May 8, 2008, and June 24, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and \nrequested a determination be made on the written record.

Taiwan maintains a strong diplomatic and \ncommercial relationship with the U.S. The U.S. and Taiwan have conducted joint \nmilitary exercises. Taiwan\u2019s national security remains under constant threat from the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. Taiwan is known to be an active collector of U.S. economic \nintelligence.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated January 14, 2008, Applicant admitted to all the \nSOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old senior developer employed with a Department of \nDefense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since February 2001. He \nhas a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and a master of science in information \nsystems, both from U.S. universities. He is married and has two children, a five-year-old \ndaughter and a three-year-old son. This is his first time applying for a security \nclearance. (Item 4.)   \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Taiwan. He immigrated to the U.S. He became \na U.S. citizen on October 20, 2005. (Item 4; Item 5) His wife is a citizen of Taiwan and \nhas U.S. permanent resident status. She resides with Applicant in the U.S. She intends \nto apply for U.S. citizenship when she is eligible. His two children were born in the U.S. \n(Answer to SOR.)   \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s brothers is a permanent resident of the U.S. and a Taiwanese \ncitizen. He intends to become a U.S. citizen when he is eligible. (Answer to SOR; Item \n4; Item 5.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, another brother, and parents-in-law are citizens of and \nreside in Taiwan. His parents and in-laws are retired. His brother is employed with a \nprivate company. The record evidence is not clear what he specifically does. Applicant \nclaims none of his family members, including his in-laws, have any contact with \ngovernment officials. (Item 5.) \n \nApplicant maintains a valid passport from Taiwan. His most recent passport was \nissued on November 20, 2003, and does not expire until November 20, 2013.  Applicant \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmaintains the passport because it is easier to travel to Taiwan using his Taiwanese \npassport.  He uses the passport for the sole purpose of visiting family members. He \ncontinues to use his Taiwanese passport after obtaining a U.S. passport in 2005 \nbecause when he travels on the U.S. passport, he can only stay in Taiwan for 29 days. \nIf he wants to stay longer than 29 days he has to obtain a visa. He is not willing to \nsurrender his Taiwanese passport or renounce his Taiwanese citizenship. (Item 4; Item \n5.)  \n \nWhen Applicant is in Taiwan, he is eligible for national health insurance. (Item 5.) \nIn November 2006, Applicant\u2019s wife began experiencing serious medical problems. In \nApril 2007, Applicant took his wife back to Taiwan for medical treatment for breast \ncancer. On May 21, 2007, he returned to the U.S. in order to work. Applicant\u2019s wife and \ntwo children remained in Taiwan with family members for the duration of her medical \ntreatment which was approximately nine months. His wife\u2019s treatment was also covered \nunder Taiwan\u2019s national health insurance. (Item 2; Item 6.)  \n \nApplicant, his wife and two children traveled to Taiwan from January 2006 to \nFebruary 2006.  They traveled to Taiwan from January 31, 2007, to March 22, 2007. \nWhen they travel to Taiwan, they stay and visit with family members. (Item 5; Item 6.)  \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant points out that Taiwan is a democratic \ncountry which has had favorable relations with the U.S. for over a century.  He does not \nfeel compelled to apologize for his decision to maintain his Taiwanese citizenship but he \nis equally proud of his decision to become a naturalized citizen. He had no malicious \nintent when he decided to keep and use his Taiwanese passport for entry and exit from \nTaiwan. He uses his Taiwanese passport as a matter of convenience.  He maintains his \nstatus as a Taiwanese citizen primarily to be eligible for health benefits for himself and \nhis family during travel to Taiwan.  He states this proved invaluable when his wife was \ndiagnosed with breast cancer. He traveled to Taiwan on several occasions to visit his \nwife during her medical treatment. Applicant considers the fact that this is being used \nagainst him a cruel irony and an injustice. (Item 2.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \n\n \n4 \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG &6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \n\n \n5 \n \n \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Of the Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC), the following \npotentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nFI DC \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion) applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s relatives who are citizens of and reside in \nTaiwan. His parents, parents-in-law, and brother are citizens of and reside in Taiwan. \nHe and his family have traveled on numerous occasions to visit family members in  \nTaiwan. Applicant\u2019s numerous visits to Taiwan to visit family members create a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, manipulation and inducement. \n \nFI DC \u00b6 7(b) (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect \nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, \ngroup or country by providing that information) applies for the same reason.  The record \nis not clear how often Applicant has contact with his relatives in Taiwan while he is in \nthe U.S. (i.e., telephonic, e-mail). Applicant and his family\u2019s close ties to his relatives in \nTaiwan is evident based on their numerous visits to Taiwan. With regard to his parents-\nin-law, there is a rebuttable presumption that an applicant has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his spouse\u2019s immediate family members. (ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 \n(Appeal Board, February 20, 2002))  \n \nFI DC & 7(d) (sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion) potentially applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s wife \nbecause she is not a U.S. citizen. However, she is a permanent U.S. resident. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his wife does not create a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion. FI DC \u00b6 7(d) does not apply.   \n \nApplicant has a brother who is a citizen of Taiwan who resides in the U.S. He is a \npermanent resident and intends to apply for U.S. citizenship when he is eligible. I find \nno foreign influence concerns with respect to Applicant\u2019s brother who resides in the U.S.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from Foreign Influence.  The following Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions \n(FI MC) have the potential to apply in Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the position or activities of those persons in that \ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government \n\n \n6 \n \n \nand the interests of the U.S.) does not apply. Family contacts and ties with persons in a \nforeign country are not automatically disqualifying but require the applicant to present \nevidence in mitigation and extenuation that he qualifies for a security clearance.   \nAlthough Applicant stated that his parents and parents-in-law are retired, no information \nwas provided about their employment prior to retiring. He indicated that his brother in \nTaiwan works for a private company but did not state what the company does or his \nbrother\u2019s position in the company.  Applicant did not provide sufficient information which \nwould support application of this mitigating condition. \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, or government, or country is so \nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest) does not apply. Applicant clearly has a sense of loyalty and obligation \nto his family members in Taiwan. While Applicant has attended college and lived in the \nU.S. a number of years, I cannot conclude that he can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of U.S. interests. He still has emotional ties to his home \ncountry which is indicated by his unwillingness to renounce his Taiwanese citizenship. \nAlthough Applicant has longstanding ties to the U.S., concerns remain because of his \nsignificant ties to his relatives in Taiwan. FI MC \u00b6 8(b) cannot be applied.      \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation) is not applicable.  Applicant\u2019s relationship with his family members who live \nand reside in Taiwan cannot be considered casual and infrequent.  \n \nSecurity concerns remain due to Applicant\u2019s relatives who are citizens of and \nreside in Taiwan. Foreign Influence concerns are not mitigated. Guideline B is found \nagainst Applicant. \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG &9:       \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States.    \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise \nsecurity concerns. Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) 10(a) (exercise \nof any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or \nthrough foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) \npossession of a current foreign passport; and (3) accepting educational, medical, \nretirement, social welfare, or other such benefits from a foreign country) applies. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant possesses a valid Taiwanese passport which does not expire until 2013. He \nuses the passport for convenience when he travels to Taiwan. He also maintains his \nTaiwanese citizenship in order to remain eligible for health care benefits in Taiwan.    \nApplicant\u2019s possession and use of a Taiwanese passport after becoming a U.S. citizen \nis considered an exercise of his rights of foreign citizenship and raises a security \nconcern under foreign preference.    \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from Foreign Preference. The following Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions \n(FP MC) have the potential to apply in Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(a) (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in \na foreign country) does not apply. While Applicant obtained his dual citizenship based \non his birth in Taiwan, he exercised his dual citizenship by using his Taiwanese \npassport after becoming a U.S. citizen. He made a conscious decision to maintain his \nTaiwanese citizenship, primarily for more convenient travel to Taiwan and in order to \nmaintain he and his family\u2019s eligibility for health care benefits.    \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(b) (the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship) does not apply. Applicant is not willing to renounce his Taiwanese \ncitizenship. While Applicant has valid reasons for not renouncing his Taiwanese \ncitizenship, it does not mitigate the security concerns under foreign preference.  \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(c) (exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign \ncitizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual \nwas a minor) does not apply. Applicant continues to exercise his rights and privileges of \nTaiwanese citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen in October 2005.  \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(d) (use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority) is not applicable to the facts of this case.  \n  \nFP MC \u00b6 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated) does not apply. Applicant has no intention of \nsurrendering his Taiwanese passport.    \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(f) (the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United \nStates Government) is not applicable because there is nothing in the record evidence \nsuggesting Applicant voted in a foreign election.  \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the Foreign Preference concerns because he intends \nto maintain and use his Taiwanese passport, and intends to exercise his rights as a \nTaiwanese citizen in order to be eligible for health care benefits in Taiwan. Applicant \nhas the burden to mitigate the security concerns raised under foreign preference. He \nhas not met his burden. Guideline C is found against Applicant. \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Guideline B is a security concern \nthat affects applicants through no fault of their own.  The government need not prove an \napplicant is a bad person before it can deny or revoke access to classified information. \nEven good people can pose a security risk because of facts and circumstances not \nunder their control. An applicant with good character and personal integrity can pose a \nsecurity risk because the applicant has close relatives in a country that is hostile to the \nUnited States. (ISCR 01-26893, at 9-10 (Appeal Board, October 16, 2002)) While the \ngovernment of Taiwan is not hostile to the U.S, it has been known to commit espionage \nagainst U.S. companies. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the \nconcerns raised based on his family members\u2019 status as citizens and residents of a \nforeign country. Applicant\u2019s decision to maintain his Taiwanese passport as well as his \nTaiwanese citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen raised security concerns under \nforeign preference. Applicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under foreign \ninfluence and foreign preference.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (e-QIP), on July 17, 2006. \nOn November 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines F and E for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 17, 2007, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the response on December 20, \n2007. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on January 30, 2008, and I \nMarch 31, 2008\n\n \n \n2\nreceived the case assignment on January 31, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing \non February 5, 2008, scheduling the hearing for February 28, 2008.  The hearing was \nheld as scheduled. \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C, which \nwere received without objection, and he testified on his own behalf. I held the record \nopen until March 7, 2008 to afford the Applicant the opportunity to submit additional \ndocuments. Applicant timely submitted AE D through I without objection, which were \nforwarded to me by Department Counsel by letter dated March 10, 2008 (Exhibit I). \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 7, 2008. The record closed \non March 10, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied all SOR allegations, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.; and 2.a. and 2.b. \nAfter a thorough review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old test technician, who has been employed by a defense \ncontractor since February 2006. Applicant earned a two-year degree in communications \nelectronics in January 1992. Tr.  62, 65. Applicant was married from November 1985 to \nJuly 2003. That marriage ended by divorce. Applicant and his former wife had two \nchildren during their marriage, an 18-year-old son and a 16-year-old daughter. Applicant \nhas not remarried.  \n \nThe SOR alleges two delinquent/charged off credit card accounts owing \napproximately $35,706. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.b.) The alleged debts are supported by the \ngovernment\u2019s evidence. GE 3, GE 4. At his hearing, he confirmed these two debts have \nbeen outstanding since 2005. He presented little evidence of efforts taken to pay or \notherwise resolve these debts since they became delinquent. Applicant claimed \nmitigating \ncircumstances \nthat \nprevented \nhim \nfrom \npaying \nhis \ndebts, \ni.e., \nunemployment/underemployment, business downturn, and the cost of going through a \ndivorce. Tr. 56-57. \n \nApplicant explained before and after his divorce became final, he liquidated his \nretirement account in order to fund a stay-at-home business as a stock trader from April \n2003 to October 2005. He chose this occupation after he lost his job as a service \nengineer in order to maintain the family home and be near his children. Unfortunately, \nhe did not generate sufficient income as a day trader or as a buyer and holder of stocks. \nHe depleted his retirement funds and was forced to use credit cards for day-to-day \nexpenses. Debt from these credit cards formed the basis for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b. \nDuring this time, he was paying alimony and child support. Tr. 38-48, 76. \n \nWhen Applicant liquidated his retirement funds, he was charged with an early \nwithdrawal penalty incurring a tax liability to the Internal Revenue Service, which he \npaid.

He anticipates receiving a family inheritance and will \ncontinue to make payments until he receives his inheritance at which time he will pay off \nany outstanding balance, if he has not already done so. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing budget \nreflects a net monthly remainder of $346. AE F.  \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant falsified his July 2006 security clearance application. \nGE 1. In response to question 28a., asking whether in the last seven years he had ever \nbeen delinquent over 180 days on any debt(s), he listed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b., but \nfailed to list the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. (SOR \u00b6 2.a.)  \n \nAlso, in response to question 28.b., asking whether he was currently over 90 \ndays delinquent on any debt(s), he listed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b., but failed to list the \ndebt in SOR 1.a. (SOR \u00b6 2.b.) \n \nApplicant credibly explained that his failure to list his debt discussed supra was \ndue to an oversight. He stated, \u201cI don\u2019t remember why I left those off. Again, I was \naware that this information was going to be checked on by the government. So I had no \nreason to \u2013 to lie about it.\u201d Tr. 56. He did, however, list the debt identified in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified on his behalf. He stated he worked closely with \nApplicant and described him as punctual, very detailed, and very organized. He added \nthat Applicant \u201ceither met or exceeded expectations. Tr. 24, 29. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Foremost are the \nDisqualifying and Mitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to \nthe facts and circumstances of the case. However, the guidelines are not viewed as \ninflexible ironclad rules of law. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. Each decision \nmust also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in \nSection 6.3 of the Directive,1 and the whole person concept.2 Having considered the \n \n1  Directive, Section 6.3. \u201cEach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense \ndetermination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent \ncriteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2 . . .\u201d \n \n             2  Directive \u00b6 2(a)  \u201c. . . The adjudication process is the careful weighing of a number of variables \nknown as the whole person concept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination. . . .\u201d The whole person \nconcept includes the consideration of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the frequency and \nrecency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; the motivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence. . .\u201d \n\n \n \n4\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nrecord evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) are the applicable relevant adjudicative guidelines. \n \nBurden of Proof \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.3 The government has the initial burden of proving \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. To meet its burden, the government must \nestablish a prima facie case by substantial evidence.4 The responsibility then shifts to \nthe applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one \nhas a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries the ultimate burden of \npersuasion.5  \n \n \nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, \ntherefore, has a compelling interest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite \njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as \nhis or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels \nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information in favor of protecting national security.6 \n \nConclusions \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations),7 the Government\u2019s concern is that \nan Applicant\u2019s \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who \nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant has a history of failing to meet his financial obligations dating back to \n2005. Since 2005, he has accumulated two delinquent/charged off credit card debts \ntotaling approximately $35,706. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC \n \n \n3  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n4  ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999) (Substantial evidence is more than a \nscintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence); ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, \n2006) (Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record); Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \n \n5  Egan, supra n.6, at 528, 531. \n \n6  See Id; Directive Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(b). \n \n7  Guidelines \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n \n5\n                                                          \nDC) \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and FC DC \u00b6 19(c): a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations; apply in this case. \n \n  \nPost-hearing, Applicant provided documentation demonstrating that he has \ncontacted these two creditors, made down payments, and established  realistic payment \nplans. His evidence reflects he has the resolve and wherewithal to pay down his debts \nuntil he has either paid them off or receives a family inheritance, at which time he will \npay off these debts in full. Applicant underwent a costly divorce. The financial toll of \nundergoing a divorce was further exacerbated following the financial losses and debt he \nincurred while he tried to make a living as a stock trader.  \n \nFollowing the loss of his job as a service engineer, he was faced with some \ndifficult choices and chose to liquidate his retirement account incurring an early \nliquidation penalty. He chose this option rather than taking a job that would require him \nto relocate and be geographically separated from his children. Unfortunately, his career \nas a stock trader was not successful and he was forced to live off his credit cards. \n \n \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,8 I conclude that two of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) \nGuidelines \u00b6 20(b): The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances; and FC MC \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; apply in this \ncase.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony establishes these mitigating factors that may be considered \nas circumstances beyond his control contributing to his inability to pay his debts. After \nfinding himself unemployed in April 2003, he was responsible for spouse and child \nsupport. He embarked in a business as a stock trader that failed to live up to his \nexpectations. These facts demonstrate circumstances beyond his control. Applicant\u2019s \nevidence is sufficient to show he has dealt responsibly with his financial obligations. \n \n He presented further evidence showing he dealt responsibly with his financial \nobligations as demonstrated by paying off his income tax liability following early \nliquidation of his retirement account. Also, he contacted his creditors, and set up a \nrepayment plan. After paying off his monthly bills, he has a net remainder of $346. \nAlthough it would have been preferable that he had contacted his creditors at an earlier \ndate, his demonstrated efforts establish he is committed to resolving this matter and \nalleviated collateral security concerns. Applicant\u2019s evidence sustains a finding that he is \nfinancially responsible and has taken control of his financial situation. Based on the \navailable evidence, his financial problems are not likely to be a concern in the future.   \n \n \n8  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered as \na whole. \n\n \n \n6\nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct), conduct involving questionable judgment, \nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can \nraise questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. Guidelines & 15. \n \nThe Government\u2019s evidence established that he failed to disclose relevant \ninformation in his answers to questions 28.a. and 28.b. of his security clearance \napplication. Considering the record as a whole, I am convinced Applicant inadvertently \nfailed to disclose this information. Numerous factors weighed in my analysis to reach \nthat conclusion, including: Applicant=s age, his level of education, his employment \nhistory, his demeanor and testimony, the number and value of the debts, the fact he did \ndisclose a significant debt putting the Government on notice his financial history was \nflawed, and the  credibility of his explanation. While he should have exercised greater \ndiligence and care in completing his security clearance application, I do not find his \nfailure to disclose the second debt deliberate. Accordingly, no disqualifying conditions \nare applicable foregoing the necessity of discussing mitigating conditions. \n \n \nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines. I applied the \nwhole person concept. I specifically considered Applicant\u2019s age, education, maturity, his \nyears working for a defense contractor, work performance, testimony of his supervisor, \ncommitment to his family, and his demeanor and conduct during his hearing. \nConsidering the totality of Applicant\u2019s circumstances, he demonstrated sufficient \njudgment and trustworthiness in the handling of his financial affairs. Furthermore, his \nalleged falsifications were not deliberate. In short, he has mitigated the security \nconcerns raised.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n7\nDecision \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance \nfor Applicant.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On December 17, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nand Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On May 27, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Wilford H.

See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d) For example, Applicant contends that he is not in debt in\nan amount in excess of $100,000 as the Judge stated.  This finding of the Judge is located in the\nAnalysis portion of the decision.  It is supported by Government Exhibits 2 and 8, Credit Reports;\nby testimony adduced at the hearing; and by Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR.  Even if the Judge\u2019s\nstatement were erroneous, it would be harmless, viewed in light of record evidence that Applicant\nhas significant delinquent debt.

However, the Judge also concluded that Applicant had not demonstrated a\nreasonable response to the debts.2  He further concluded that Applicant had not demonstrated that\nhis financial problems are being resolved or that he had initiated a good-faith effort to pay off his\ndebts.3  The Judge\u2019s conclusions are sustainable.  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to retain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant admits all of the allegations in this paragraph of the SOR. The Applicant submits that the majority of his financial problems began when his wife became addicted to gambling in South Korea, where he and his wife live. Basically, the Applicant stated that his wife would take his credit cards without his permission and receive cash advances with them. She would then gamble, and lose, this money. This occurred in 1999 and 2000. The Applicant did not know that his wife was doing this until he received the credit card statements a month or so after she obtained the money. He attempted to stay current with the debts after she incurred them, but they were just overwhelming. Around 2002 he stopped paying any of these debts. He has repeatedly stated his intention is to fulfill these obligations, assuming that he retains his security clearance. (Transcript at 35-39, 41, 50; Government Exhibit 3.) 3 1.a.

He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to retain a security\nclearance in connection with his employment. \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he is financially overextended and therefore at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  The Applicant admits all of the allegations in\nthis paragraph of the SOR. \nThe Applicant submits that the majority of his financial problems began when his\nwife became addicted to gambling in South Korea, where he and his wife live.\nBasically, the Applicant stated that his wife would take his credit cards without his\npermission and receive cash advances with them.  She would then gamble, and lose,\nthis money.  This occurred in 1999 and 2000.  The Applicant did not know that his wife\nwas doing this until he received the credit card statements a month or so after she\nobtained the money.  He attempted to stay current with the debts after she incurred\nthem, but they were just overwhelming.  Around 2002 he stopped paying any of these\ndebts.  He has repeatedly stated his intention is to fulfill these obligations, assuming that\nhe retains his security clearance.  (Transcript at 35-39, 41, 50; Government Exhibit 3.) \n\n3\n1.a.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to a collection agency for Chase\nin the amount of approximately $17,391.00.  (Government Exhibit 8 at 2.) The Applicant\nhas made no recent payments on this debt and has no current plans to make payments\non this debt.  (Transcript at 39-40.)    \n1.b.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to a collection agency for\nDiscover in the amount of approximately $6,135.00.  (Government Exhibit 8 at 2.) The\nApplicant has made no recent payments on this debt and has no current plans to make\npayments on this debt.  (Transcript at 40-41.)    \n1.c.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to Unifund in the amount of\napproximately $18,915.00.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 9.) The Applicant has made no\nrecent payments on this debt and has no current plans to make payments on this debt.\n(Transcript at 40-41.)    \n1.d.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to a collection agency in the\namount of approximately $29,829.00.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 2.) The Applicant has\nmade no recent payments on this debt and has no current plans to make payments on\nthis debt.  (Transcript at 42.)\n \n1.e.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to American Express in the\namount of approximately $3,796.00.  (Government Exhibit 8 at 1.) He testified that he\nmade some payments on this account in about 2002.  The Applicant has made no\nrecent payments on this debt and has no current plans to make payments on this debt.\n(Transcript at 42-44.)\n1.f.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to a collection agency in the\namount of approximately $31,643.00.  (Government Exhibit 8 at 1.) The Applicant has\nmade no recent payments on this debt and has no current plans to make payments on\nthis debt.  (Transcript at 42.)\n1.g.\nThe Applicant admitted that he had failed to file his income tax returns in a\ntimely manner from 1998 through 2005.  This was due to a mistaken belief concerning\nthe money he would owe, and the status of the income he earned overseas.  He\ntestified that he has filed all of his tax returns and is fully up to date with the taxing\nauthorities.  (Transcript at 35-36.)\n1.h.\nAs stated above, the Applicant\u2019s wife was a compulsive gambler in 1999-\n2000.  According to the Applicant, her conduct created many of his financial difficulties.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)  \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has foreign contacts and interests that could lead to the exercise\nof poor judgment, unreliability or untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\n\nAll of the following statements are supported by the documents submitted by the Department Counsel in\n2\nsupport of his request for administrative notice.  (Administrative Notice request dated March 24, 2008, and\nAttachments I through XV.)\n4\nThe Applicant was stationed in South Korea several times during his military\nservice.  After his retirement from the military in 1994, he decided to return to South\nKorea and found work with his current employer.  He has been employed by them\ncontinuously since that time.  (Transcript at 60-61.)\nThe Applicant has been married to his present wife since 1996.  She is his third\nwife, and is a citizen of South Korea.  According to the Applicant, his wife has no desire\nto become an American citizen.  She will move with him to the United States when he\nreturns home.  (Transcript at 52-53.)   The Applicant testified that about half of his co-\nworkers (approximately 60 out of 100) also have Korean born spouses.  (Transcript at\n61-62.)\nThe Applicant has many contacts with South Korea.  Accordingly, it is\nappropriate to discuss the relationship of South Korea and the United States at this\ntime.   South Korea is a stable, democratic republic.  While the South Korean\n2\ngovernment generally respected the human rights of its citizens, some problems\nconcerning human rights remain.  The United States maintains a substantial military\npresence in South Korea, and the United States and South Korea are close military\nallies.  South Korea does have a history of collecting protected United States\ninformation.  At least one U.S. government employee has been prosecuted for\ndisclosure of classified information to persons connected to the South Korean\ngovernment.  In addition, several American companies have received substantial civil\npenalties connected with their transfer of sensitive material to South Korea. \nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through J and P, containing his\nDD 214, as well as letters of achievement and various commendations for his work in\nthe military and civilian sectors.  They show him to be a highly respected employee. \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits K, L, M and N are letters of recommendation from co-\nworkers and supervisors.   The Applicant is described as someone who \u201cconsistently set\n(sic)  the example for others in job performance and professionalism.\u201d  Another person\ndescribes the Applicant as someone who is, \u201cintelligent, dependable and motivated.\u201d\nAnother fellow employee describes the Applicant this way, \u201cHis integrity and loyalty are\nbeyond reproach.\u201d  Finally, his Program Manager states that the Applicant, \u201cis honest,\ntrustworthy, loyal to the United States and its armed forces.\u201d\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\n\n5\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The Applicant, by his own admission, has approximately\n$107,000.00 in past due debts, all of which have been due and owing for several years. \nIn addition, as the Applicant admits, his wife had a serious gambling problem\nwhich precipitated this problem.  Accordingly, AG \u00b6 19(f) also applies, \u201cFinancial\nproblems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, gambling problems, or other issues\nof security concern.\u201d  Finally, the Applicant also admits not timely filing his tax returns\nfor several years.  This brings into play AG \u00b6 19(g), \u201cFailure to file annual Federal, state,\nor local income tax returns as required or fraudulent filing of the same.\u201d  The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nWith regards to his tax situation, subparagraph 1.g., the evidence shows that the\nApplicant has resolved his tax situation.  He is knowledgeable about his responsibility to\nfile his income tax returns on time and evinces a credible intent to do it.  This\nsubparagraph is found for the Applicant.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose primarily between about 1999 and 2000, and were connected\nto his wife\u2019s compulsive gambling.  However, he has basically done nothing to resolve\nthis indebtedness.  He has repeatedly stated he will resolve and/or pay these debts if he\nreceives his security clearance.  Not to put too fine a point on it, but the United States\nGovernment is not a collection agency.  In addition, a stated intention to pay just debts\nsometime in the future, no matter how sincere, is not evidence of current security\nclearance eligibility.  It is the Applicant\u2019s burden to submit evidence showing that his\n\n7\nfinancial situation has improved.  He has not done so.  This mitigating condition is not\napplicable to this case.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances.\u201d  This mitigating condition is not applicable to this case.  I\nhave considered the fact that it was his wife, and not the Applicant, who had the\ngambling problem.  However, the evidence in this case does not show that the Applicant\nhas acted reasonably under the circumstances.  He has known for almost two years\nthat the Government has concerns about his financial situation, yet he has done virtually\nnothing to resolve them.  This mitigating condition is not applicable in this case.\nThe Applicant has not initiated a good-faith effort to pay off his creditors.\nAccordingly, AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable.  Finally, given the fact that he is over\n$100,000.00 in debt with no plan to resolve it but a vague promise to do so at some\nunstated time in the future, I cannot find that \u201cthere are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c).  Accordingly,\nsubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f., and 1.h., as well as Paragraph 1, are found against the\nApplicant.  \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \nThe concern under Guideline B is styled as follows:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in\nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\nThe Applicant has connections to South Korea because he lives there and his\nwife is a South Korean national.  The Applicant has lived and worked in South Korea for\nmany years.  In his case, he has worked for the same Defense contractor that entire\ntime.  His presence in South Korea for that period of time, under these circumstances,\nhas little to no security significance.  \nIn addition, it must be said that the Applicant is far from the first American military\nmember to have a foreign born spouse.  In fact, the Applicant testified that over half of\nhis co-workers have foreign born spouses.  Accordingly, a closer examination of his\nparticular circumstances is required.  He testified that, other than his spouse, he has no\n\n8\nreal contacts with Koreans.  Once again, under the particular circumstances of this\ncase,  this fact has little to no current security significance.\nAll of these connections must also be viewed in the context of the South Korean\ngovernment, and in particular that government\u2019s history of attempting to obtain classified\nand other information from American companies and individuals.  To his credit, the\nApplicant repeatedly stated that he is a loyal American citizen, that he understands his\nresponsibilities as a security clearance holder, and that he would not be a party to any\nattempt by the South Korean government to obtain information from him.  In my opinion,\nhe has met his burden of showing an unequivocal connection to the United States. \nBased on the evidence the Government has presented, the following\nDisqualifying Conditions apply to this case: 7.(a) \u201cContact with a foreign family member .\n. . who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d; (b)\n\u201cconnections to a foreign person . . . that create a potential conflict of interest between\nthe individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that information\u201d; and (d)\n\u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion.\u201d  I have also considered the information concerning the South Korean\ngovernment, provided by Department Counsel in his request for Administrative Notice\nand its Attachments.\nThe Applicant has provided compelling evidence to show that the following\nMitigating Conditions also apply to this particular case, given his particular background:\n7(a) \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.\u201d; and (b) \u201cThere is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d \nThe Applicant is a talented, able and trustworthy person.  He has a Korean born\nspouse, and he lives and works in South Korea.  I have weighed his connections to\nSouth Korea with his loyal service to the United States both as a member of the Armed\nForces and as a civilian contractor.  In this case, his evidence is sufficient to overcome\nthe concerns the Government has under this allegation.  Paragraph 2 is found for the\nApplicant. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\n\n9\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a respected\nemployee who is under a severe financial strain caused by his wife\u2019s actions, and has\nbeen for several years.  He has not made a sufficient showing that his debt situation is\nunder control.  Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), the Applicant\u2019s conduct is recent.  Based on the\nstate of the record, I cannot find that there have been permanent behavioral changes\nunder AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  Accordingly, at the present time, I cannot find that there is little to\nno potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)8)), or that the\nlikelihood of recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b6 2(a)9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations at this time.  As stated above, he has mitigated the concerns about\nforeign influence over the Applicant.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\nParagraph 2 is found for the Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst the Applicant\n\n10\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on December 19, 2007. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline E for personal conduct. For the reasons discussed\nbelow, this case is decided for Applicant.\nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nJuly 10, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n The corrected version of the transcript identifies the administrative judge by the correct name.  \n3\n2\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR was received on January 25, 2008, and he\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on March 7, 2008. At the request of\nApplicant\u2019s counsel, the hearing took place on June 3, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on June 13, 2008. A corrected version of the transcript was received on July,\n7, 2008.  Citations to the transcript refer to the corrected version. \n3\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleges a single allegation based on a dispute\nbetween Applicant and a former employer, and it is summarized as follows:\nIn August 2005, you were sued in federal district court by Company A,\nyour employer from April 2005 to August 2005, for breach of contract,\nconversion, and breach of fiduciary duty. The lawsuit was settled before\ntrial when you agreed to pay Company A $55,000, to show where files\nwere stored on the company\u2019s server, to allow examination of your\npersonal computer, to not work at three military facilities for two years, and\nto not work on the contract you had been working on at Company A.\nIn his Answer, Applicant admits the allegation, and the allegation is likewise established\nby the record evidence. In addition, the following facts are established by substantial\nevidence.\nApplicant is a 61-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for\nhis current employer since August 2005. His current position or job title is director of\nbusiness development. He has been married to the same woman for nearly 40 years,\nand he and his spouse have two adult children.\nHe is seeking to obtain an industrial security clearance for his current\nemployment. He completed a security-clearance application in December 2005 (Exhibit\n1). In doing so, he disclosed the lawsuit brought by his former employer. He explained\nthat part of the lawsuit had been dismissed and other allegations were pending\nresolution. The lawsuit stemmed from his four-month period of employment with\nCompany A in 2005.\n\n3\nOn March 14, 2005, Applicant was hired to fill the position of program director for\na particular contract of Company A. He was hired as an at-will employee, meaning that\nhe could resign at any time with or without notice or cause, and his employment could\nbe discontinued at any time with or without notice or cause (Exhibit F\u2013part 1). On March\n15, 2005, he signed an employment agreement that included non-competition and non-\nsolicitation clauses (Exhibit F\u2013part 2). \nHe started work the following month. He reported directly to the company\npresident/CEO and he understood he would have reasonable access to the CEO for\nthat purpose. He found it difficult to establish a working relationship with the CEO, as he\nhad limited access or communication with the CEO. For example, Applicant does not\nrecall the CEO ever answering an e-mail. In short, he soon found his new position to be\na disappointment. \nIn late July and early August 2005, Applicant was offered and accepted his\ncurrent position. On about August 3 , he informed the CEO of his decision to resign.\nrd\nThe discussion ended with some animosity when the CEO learned Applicant had\naccepted a job with his current employer. The CEO told Applicant he was to depart that\nday and the CEO escorted him to the door (Applicant had offered notice of two weeks).\nUpon his departure, Applicant recalls the CEO telling him \u201cI wish the blessings of Jesus\non you, but my lawyer is going to hunt you down and I\u2019m going to sue you\u201d or words to\nthat effect (Tr. 79). \nA few weeks later on August 25 , Company A brought a civil action against\nth\nApplicant in federal district court (Exhibit 2\u2013complaint). The lawsuit alleged that after\nApplicant\u2019s resignation, Company A discovered that Applicant had removed confidential\nfiles, deleted confidential electronic files and e-mails, and electronically transferred\nconfidential files and e-mails to his personal e-mail account. Based on these matters,\nthe lawsuit alleged three causes of action: (1) breach of contract by violating terms of an\nemployment contract; (2) conversion by wrongfully exercising control of the company\u2019s\ndocumentation concerning a particular program; and (3) breach of fiduciary duty to his\nemployer. The lawsuit sought to obtain, among other things, $500,000 in compensatory\ndamages and $500,000 in punitive damages. Applicant denied the claims and filed a\ncounterclaim alleging entitlement to unpaid salary and expenses. \nAccording to the company president of Applicant\u2019s current employer, the position\noffered to Applicant was not related to the contract he had worked on for Company A\n(Exhibit B\u2013president\u2019s statement). Nevertheless, the lawsuit was heavily litigated with\nApplicant\u2019s current employer paying the litigation costs, estimated at about $75,000.\nThe firm\u2019s chief operating officer and general counsel characterized the allegations\nagainst Applicant as \u201ctotally baseless, abusive, and bordered on ludicrous\u201d (Exhibit\nB\u2013general counsel\u2019s statement). \nIn November 2005, the court granted Applicant\u2019s partial motion to dismiss the\nbreach of contract claim that was based on the non-competition and non-solicitation\nclauses of the employment agreement (Exhibit A\u2013memorandum opinion and order). The\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n4\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n4\ncourt granted the motion to dismiss because the non-competition and non-solicitation\nclauses were overbroad and unreasonable, and therefore not enforceable against\nApplicant. In addition, the court dismissed Company A\u2019s request for injunctive relief\nrequesting Applicant be prohibited from accepting employment with a competitor of\nCompany A. \nIn time, Applicant\u2019s employer decided to no longer pay the litigation costs and\nApplicant would have to cover that expense, which was estimated at another $100,000\nto bring the case to trial (Exhibit B\u2013general counsel\u2019s statement; Tr. 71\u201373). Applicant\ndecided the best course of action was to settle the case to minimize the damage (Tr.\n73). In the opinion of the general counsel, settlement had nothing to do with the merits\nof the lawsuit, but was a way to end the \u201csenseless litigation\u201d pursued by Company A\n(Exhibit B\u2013general counsel\u2019s statement).\nThe lawsuit was settled in February 2006 (Exhibit A\u2013settlement agreement).\nApplicant agreed to pay Company A $55,000 and abide by other terms. The case was\nsettled without an admission of liability by either Applicant or Company A. Accordingly,\nthe court ordered that the case be dismissed with prejudice as settled (Exhibit A\u2013final\norder). Applicant has complied with the terms of the settlement agreement, to include\npaying the $55,000. \nApplicant\u2019s new job resulted in a salary decrease of about $20,000 annually (Tr.\n115\u2013116). He is now earning about $12,000 less per year than when he was employed\nby Company A. \nApplicant\u2019s employment history includes approximately 31 years of military\nservice, including about 25 years on active duty in the Army (Exhibit D). His service\nincludes a 12-month tour of duty in Vietnam during 1968\u201369 when he participated in\nmore than 25 aerial missions over hostile territory as a helicopter pilot. He also served\nin Panama and was involved in the operational planning for Operation Just Cause. His\ndocumentary exhibits reflect a successful and distinguished career as a miliary officer\nthat ended with his retirement as a colonel (Exhibit D). He held a security clearance, at\nvarious levels, during his military service (Tr. 34\u201335). In addition to his military service,\nApplicant presented several character statements vouching his suitability for a security\nclearance (Exhibit C). \n \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.4\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n7\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n11\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n12\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n13\n5\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n5\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes\n6\nany existing security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n7\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n8\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n9\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n10\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n11\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.12\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.13\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n14\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n15\nconditions).  \n Revised Guidelines at 10.\n16\n6\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n14\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and\n15\ncredible adverse information that may not be enough to support action under any other\nguideline. In particular, a security concern may arise due to:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n16\nThe gravamen of the SOR is an employment dispute between Applicant and\nCompany A. The dispute resulted in Company A bringing a federal lawsuit and\nApplicant responding with denials of wrongdoing and a counterclaim. The parties settled\nthe case with Applicant agreeing to pay $55,000 as contrasted with the $1 million in\ndamages sought by Company A. In settling the case, neither Applicant nor Company A\nadmitted liability. These circumstances raise a potential security concern under\nGuideline E\u2019s DC 4, which provides as follows:\nCredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination,\nbut which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited\nto consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include\nbreach of client confidentiality, release of proprietary information,\nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other government protected\ninformation; (2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the\nworkplace; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and, (4) evidence\n\n Revised Guidelines at 11. \n17\n Revised Guidelines at 11. \n18\n7\nof significant misuse of Government or other employer's time or\nresources.17\nGiven the substantial-evidence standard, the totality of facts and circumstances\nsurrounding the lawsuit raise concerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment, trustworthiness, and\nreliability. Because the case was settled without an admission of liability, the lawsuit did\nnot establish if Applicant breached a duty to Company A, it did not establish if Applicant\nreleased propriety or sensitive corporate information, and it did not establish if Applicant\nviolated the terms of the non-competition and non-solicitation clauses, which the federal\ncourt ruled were overbroad and unenforceable. Nevertheless, Applicant\u2019s resignation\nand the resulting lawsuit justify scrutiny of his security suitability. \nAll of the MC under Guideline E have been reviewed and given due\nconsideration. The most pertinent is MC 3, which provides as follows:\nThe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.18\nMC 3 applies in Applicant\u2019s favor for several reasons.\nFirst, it applies because this dispute stems from Applicant\u2019s employment with\nCompany A during April\u2013August 2005, about three years ago, and the lawsuit was\nsettled in February 2006, more than two years ago. Although it is not ancient history at\nthis point, it is  sufficiently in the past to be considered not recent. Second, it applies\nbecause this dispute is the only blemish on what is otherwise an outstanding military\nand employment record. On that basis, it is considered an infrequent or isolated\nincident. Third, it applies because the dispute happened under the unique\ncircumstances of Applicant\u2019s employment with Company A and it is unlikely to recur.\nIndeed, nothing in his military or employment record suggests otherwise. Fourth, it\napplies because the dispute no longer casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. The dispute was resolved more than two years ago\nwhen the parties agreed to settle the case without a trial on the merits and without an\nadmission of liability, and the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice. Accordingly, the\ncurrent security significance of the dispute is diminished. \nThis case presents both unfavorable and favorable evidence, which requires\nthoughtful balancing in light of the whole\u2013person concept and the clearly-consistent\nstandard. I have considered the totality of facts and circumstances and conclude the\nfavorable evidence is persuasive. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due consideration\nto Applicant\u2019s record of honorable military service as a highly professional and\n\n8\nsuccessful Army officer. This circumstance suggests that he has the requisite self-\ncontrol, good judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation. \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns. Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to\nobtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:\n \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with national interest  to\ngrant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.   \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

On December 21, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns for \nfinancial considerations and personal conduct under Guidelines F and E for Applicant. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 11, 2008. \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing in an undated response received at \nDOHA on January 30, 3008.  She admitted ten and denied five of the allegations under \nGuideline F and denied the allegation under Guideline E.  She provided an explanation \nfor her admissions and denials.

Applicant\u2019s five children range in \nage from 20-year-old to 20 months old.  All live at home, including the oldest who is a \nstudent.  Applicant\u2019s combined monthly expenses are approximately $3,307, which \nincludes payments for payment plans on her delinquent debts.  She has a discretionary \nremainder each month of only $280 (Tr. 80-99; See, Gov. Ex. 4, Interrogatories, dated \nOctober 23, 2007, at 4, Personal Financial Statement; App. Ex.

Ex. 5, Judgment, dated \nJune 23, 2004; Gov. Ex. 6, credit report, dated April 23, 2008). \n \nApplicant signed for her mother\u2019s hospital bill and is responsible for the $2,568 \ndebt (SOR 1.a).  Applicant pays at least $113 on this debt every other week.  When she \ncan, she makes additional payments.  She has a payment plan and has reduced the \nbalance to about $1,139.  She also has a plan to pay the debt early if funds that are \nanticipated become available for payment (Tr. 20-23, 99-100; App. Ex. A, payment \nreceipt, dated April 29, 2008).  \n \nThe judgment listed in SOR allegation 1.b is for dental work for her children.  \nApplicant continues to go to the same dentist and is paying on her account.  The \nbalance is now $450 (Tr. 20-23; 100; App. Ex. B, Account information, dated, March 4, \n2008). \n \nThe collection account listed in SOR allegation 1.c is for $1,348 for the funeral \nexpenses of her minor child that died.  The debt was paid in full by the family and the \ninsurance company (Tr. 25-26, 100; App. Ex. C (Status letter, settled in full, dated, \nMarch 17, 2008). \n \nSOR allegations 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f are for dishonored checks written on Applicant\u2019s \naccount by her oldest son without her knowledge or permission for $591, $30, and $25.  \nThe $591 check was paid off in two installments of $303.21 (Tr. 25-26, 100-102; App. \nEx. D Bank account statement, dated April 3, 2008).  The $30 and $25 checks have \nbeen redeemed and paid (Tr. 29-32, 103-104; App. Ex M Bank account statement, \ndated May 2, 2008). \n \nThe automobile loan for $4,997 listed in SOR allegation 1.g is for the balance on \na car destroyed in a hurricane.  Applicant and her husband settled this account for \n$3,300 and it paid in full (Tr. 32-35; App. Ex. E, Letter, dated March 18, 2008).   \n \nSOR allegation 1.h is the debt on a time share property previously owned by \nApplicant and her husband.  The property was sold and the debt cleared.  It was \nremoved from Applicant\u2019s husband credit report and is being removed from her credit \nreport (Tr. 32-36, 105-111; App. Ex F, credit report, dated March 6, 2008). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR allegation 1.i and 1.n are collection accounts of $232, and $273 for the \nsame cell phone debt.  Applicant moved from one cell phone plan to another within the \nsame company, and the new plan absorbed the amount due on the old plan.  Her cell \nphone account is current.   The debts are not listed on the latest credit reports (Tr. 37; \nGov. Ex. 6, credit report, dated April 23, 2008; App. Ex. K, credit report, dated April 29, \n2008). \n \nSOR allegation 1.j is a collection account for $622 on a past due student loan.  \nThe debt has been paid in full (Tr. 37-39, 114-115; App. Ex G, proposed settlement \nletter, dated April 24, 2008; App. Ex. L, bank statement for paid settlement, dated May \n19, 2008; App. Ex. N, credit report, dated May 19, 2008).  \n \nSOR allegation 1.k is an automobile loan payment past due for $483.  Applicant \nwas late on one of her automobile payments because she was hospitalized.  She made \nup the payment and the latest credit reports show the debt is current (Tr. 39-41; Gov. \nEx. 6, credit report, dated April 23, 2008; App. Ex. K, credit report, dated April 29, 2008). \n \nSOR allegation 1.l is a student loan past due for $239.  The loan has been \ndeferred and Applicant has requested an extension of the deferment (Tr. 45-46; App. \nEx. H, Deferment request, dated April 29, 2008). \n \nSOR allegation 1.m is a collection account for $457.  This account has been paid \nin full (Tr. 43-45; App. Ex. D, bank statement, dated April 3, 2008). \n \nIn response to questions on her security clearance application concerning her \nfinances, Applicant listed one debt as currently more than 90 days past due but listed no \ndebts in the last seven years that were more than 180 days past due.  Six debts were \nmore than 180 days past due.  Applicant informed a security manager of the one debt \nlisted, and she was advised to note the debt on the form.  She was paying on some of \nthe older debts.  She was informed that the debts she was paying did not have to be \nlisted.  She did not have knowledge of other debts caused by her son writing bad \nchecks (Tr. 123-127). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18)  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an Applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \n\n \n6 \n \n \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations.  Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts admitted by Applicant and listed in credit \nreports are a security concern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions \n(FC DC) \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations),  Since two of the debts are listed twice, the \nestablished SOR allegations are for 13 delinquent debts. \n \n \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment) does have some application.  The debts happened \nyears ago and some were paid in the past, two are still being paid, and some were just \ncleared recently.  The behavior causing the debt did not happen long ago.  There were \na variety of debts from car loans, to dental and medical debts, to student loans, to time \nshare loans.  The accumulation of debt was not infrequent.  Some of the debts were \naccumulated under unusual circumstances.  Applicant had medical problems and one of \nher young children died.  Her son wrote dishonored checks on her account without her \nknowledge.  She and her husband are separated and are in the process of divorcing.  I \ngave consideration to these unusual circumstances leading to some of the delinquent \ndebts.  Since the debts have either been paid or are being paid, they do not cast doubt \non Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) has some application to Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial issues.  As noted, some of the debt arose because of her son writing \ndishonored checks on her account.  She was sick and hospitalized for a period of time \nlosing time at work and salary.  One of her young children passed away requiring \nfuneral expenses.  Applicant either paid or is paying her debts.  She acted reasonably \nunder the circumstances.  \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay the \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies.  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed.  \nApplicant has the ability to pay the debts, has shown a strong desire to pay them, and \nhas shown a good effort to pay them.  Applicant paid ten of the 13 delinquent accounts.  \nShe has payment plans on two accounts and is current with her payments.  She has a \nstudent loan that is under deferment and no payment is required.  Her present credit \nreport and other documents show her accounts are paid or being paid.  Applicant acted \nresponsibly towards her debts and they are under control.  Applicant established her \ngood-faith efforts to resolve her debts, and mitigated security concerns related to her \nfinancial situation. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.  The security \nclearance system depends on the individual providing correct and accurate information.  \nIf a person conceals or provides false information, the security clearance process \ncannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified information is in the \nbest interest of the United States Government.  Applicant\u2019s incomplete answer to a \nquestion on her security clearance application concerning her past due debts raises a \nsecurity concern under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(a) \n(the deliberate omission concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, to determine security eligibility or trustworthiness). \n \n \nAppellant denied intentional falsification.  Applicant credibly testified that when \nshe completed her security clearance application, she listed the debt she knew that was \npast due more than 90 days.  She thought other debts past due more than 180 days \neither were being paid and not past due, or had been paid.  She discussed her debts \nwith a security official, who informed her that any debts she was paying on or had paid \ndid not have to be listed on the form.  In addition, she was not aware of some debts that \nwere caused by her son\u2019s bad check misconduct.  While there is a security concern for \nan omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or \noral statement submitted to the government when applying for a security clearance, \nevery omission, concealment, or inaccurate statement is not a falsification.  A \nfalsification must be deliberate and material.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and \nwillfully.  Since Applicant listed the one debt she was aware of, and she did not \nreasonably know she had other delinquent debts, the available information shows her \nfailure to list delinquent debts was not knowing and willful.  Applicant established she \ndid not deliberately provide false information on the security clearance application with \nintent to deceive.  I find for Appellant as to Personal Conduct.   \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \n\n \n8 \n \n \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the \nultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall \ncommon sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the \nwhole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potential disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nservice in the Army and Army Reserve. I considered that she is raising five children as a \nsingle mother, and has had medical problems causing periods of unemployment.  I \nconsidered she took responsibility for the debts and either paid them or is paying them \nas agreed.  I considered that Applicant\u2019s financial obligations not listed as security \nconcerns are paid as agreed.  Her finances do not create a security concern.  She did \nnot provide incomplete information on her security clearance application with the intent \nto deceive.  Overall, on balance the record evidence leaves me with no questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 9, 2008. He did not \nspecifically state whether he wanted a hearing. On February 23, 2008, Department \nCounsel requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge pursuant to \u00b6 E3.1.7 of the \nDirective. The case was assigned to me on March 11, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of \nMay 8, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nhearing on March 14, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 15, 2008. The \nGovernment called one witness and offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 23, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits \n(AE) A through M, which were received without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request \nto keep the record open until April 29, 2008, to submit additional matters through \nDepartment Counsel. No additional evidence was submitted. The record closed on April \n29, 2008. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 23, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all the factual allegations in the SOR. \nHe also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security \nclearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is a high school \ngraduate. He was married in 1985 and divorced in 1999. He remarried in 2003. He was \na stepfather to his first wife\u2019s two children. He and his current wife have an infant child \nand he is stepfather to her two children.1  \n \n \nApplicant and his first wife separated in late 1997, prior to their acrimonious \ndivorce. He provided her with about $5,000 to $10,000 to pay their debts. She did not \npay all the debts that she agreed to pay. He injured his shoulder, requiring surgery in \nApril 1998. He was unemployed from about December 1998 through September 2000. \nHe received Workers\u2019 Compensation which ended before he started working again. He \nhad another operation on his shoulder in March 2000. Applicant relocated several times \nsince 2000, and had additional periods of unemployment.2   \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1b, and 1.c, which list debts of \n$11,128, $10,377, and $5,397 to the same credit union. SOR \u00b6 1.a is for an auto loan. \nThe two other debts are installment loans. Applicant had an account with a credit union \nunder a different name than the credit union listed in the SOR. In November 2003, \nApplicant\u2019s credit union merged with and into the credit union named in the allegations. \nHe stated he was never informed of the name change. He further stated that his former \nwife took out loans in his name. Three loan applications with his credit union were \nintroduced as evidence. A loan application dated November 1996, to increase a \nsignature loan by $974 to $9,672 already owed, for a balance of $10,647, does not \nshow a signature. The loan is only in Applicant\u2019s name and the application indicates that \nthe signature is on the check. An application dated July 11, 1997, to obtain an additional \n$4,000 on a signature loan to bring the balance to more than $13,000, was signed by \nboth Applicant and his former wife. This is an application for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b. Applicant subsequently admitted that he owed this debt. The last application is to \nadvance $12,120 on an existing auto loan, raising the balance of the loan to $17,080. \nThe loan was secured by three vehicles. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife signed the application and \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 47-48, 62, 113-114; GE 1, 2, 9; AE C. \n \n2 Tr. at 33, 48-55, 58-59, 91; Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR; GE 2-4. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nthere is a signature purporting to be signed by Applicant. There is no date next to the \nsignature but the date of the advance is July 15, 1997, the same day the $4,000 was \nadvanced in the previous application. Applicant stated his wife signed his name on this \napplication without his knowledge.3 After viewing the signatures and comparing them, I \nfind the signature on that application was not signed by Applicant.  \n \n \nApplicant sent a letter to his credit union on December 30, 1997, asking them to \nremove his wife\u2019s name from all accounts. Applicant initially testified that the only debt \nhe was aware of was the debt that he signed for. The loan with the disputed signature \nwas an auto loan. The loan application he admitted signing was for a signature loan. He \nstated he only became aware of the other two loans when he received copies of the \ndocuments from Department Counsel. In March 2000, the credit union agreed to permit \nApplicant to switch one vehicle solely into his name, with the credit union remaining as \nthe secured party on the lien of $3,625. Applicant stated he was unaware of the lien \nbefore he went to title the vehicle in his name. He stated that he closed out all his \naccounts and made sure that everything was paid off in about 2000, when he asked the \ncompany to repossess the car that secured the loan. He stated that he was never told \nthat there was a deficiency balance owed on the loan. Applicant\u2019s initial testimony that \nhe was only aware of the debt he signed for was contradicted by his testimony about \nthe car loan and the repossession.4   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d lists a judgment of $3,403 awarded against Applicant on September \n1, 1999, to his first wife\u2019s credit union. The judgment was for a car loan that Applicant \nand his first wife co-signed in September 1994. Applicant and his ex-wife had four \nvehicles, one for each of them and two for her teenaged children. When they separated \nand divorced she took three cars and he took one. Applicant told a background \ninvestigator in November 2006, that he had no knowledge of this debt. He admitted at \nthe hearing that he signed for this loan. He testified that he thought this car loan was \npaid by his ex-wife through a wage garnishment. Applicant admitted that he received a \nnotice to appear in court for this lawsuit. He stated he received a second notice \npostponing the trial, but he never received another notice telling him when to appear.5   \n \n \nA judgment of $4,102 was awarded against Applicant to a financial institution on \nSeptember 9, 1999, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. Applicant stated he borrowed $1,400 from \nthe financial institution in about September 1995, to purchase a vehicle. He stated his \nstepson wrecked the car and he thought the insurance paid off the loan. The judgment \nwas for a car loan that Applicant and his first wife co-signed in September 1994. \nApplicant admitted that he received a notice to appear in court for this lawsuit but he did \nnot attend the trial.6   \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 33-46, 75-85; GE 12-14, 23. \n \n4 Tr. at 33-46, 75-85; GE 13, 14, 16, 17. \n \n5 Tr. at 59-70; GE 4, 6, 8, 20-23. \n \n6 Tr. at 42, 70-75; GE 6, 7, 18, 19, 23. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.l list seven medical debts to an \u201cunidentified collection \nagency.\u201d The debts range from $60 to $3,085 for a total of $6,313. Applicant stated that \nWorkers\u2019 Compensation should have covered these medical debts. He submitted \ndocumentation that his medical debts related to his shoulder were to be paid by \nWorkers\u2019 Compensation. The debts are listed on the credit report of January 7, 2006, \nbut are not listed on the credit report of August 30, 2007 or the Experian credit report of \nOctober 17, 2007, submitted by Applicant with his response to Interrogatories.7 \n \n \nApplicant had two state tax liens filed in 1996 for $2,150 and in 1998 for $2,030. \nThe taxes were paid and the liens released. Applicant is not delinquent on any of his \ncurrent bills. He has never received financial counseling. He wrote in his Answer to the \nSOR for allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e: \n \nBankruptcy Lawyer advised me in 2005 that since it was possible my ex-\nwife may have taken out fraudulent or additional loans and the [statute] of \nlimitation was in effect. That it would not be advisable to settle this debt. \n \nApplicant submitted a letter dated February 6, 2008 from an attorney, which stated: \n \nPlease be advised [Applicant] sought my assistance approximately two \nyears ago to clear up discrepancies on his credit report. I contacted the \nvarious credit reporting agencies and the companies listed on his credit \nreport. I requested that the credit reporting agencies remove any negative \ncomments pertaining to these debts as [Applicant] had no reason to \nbelieve that he incurred these debts or that they should have been \nincluded in his credit reports. I requested each company to provide me \nwith proof that these debts belonged to him. None were ever able to do \nso.8 \n \nApplicant testified that now that he is aware of his delinquent debts that he plans on \npaying the debts that are in his name.9 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) \nsigned on May 31, 2005. Question 28a asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over \n180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d Question 28b, asked, \u201cAre you currently over 90 \ndays delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d He did not answer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d he hand wrote in for \nQuestion 28a, \u201cunknown.\u201d For Question 28b, he wrote \u201cLawyer Researching.\u201d10  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86), certified as true on \nJuly 7, 2005. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to Questions 37 and 38, which asked \u201cIn the last 7 \n                                                          \n7 Tr. at 93-105; GE 3-5; AE E, M. \n \n8 AE B. \n \n9 Tr. at 46, 65, 84, 109-112, 126; GE 1, 3-5; AE D, F-L. \n \n10 GE 2. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nyears, have you had any judgements against you that have not been paid?\u201d and \u201cIn the \nlast 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant \nanswered \u201cYes\u201d to Question 39, which asked, \u201cAre you currently over 90 days \ndelinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d He listed a state tax debt of $3,900 incurred in September \n1996.11 \n \nApplicant denied the three falsification allegations in the SOR. I considered all \nthe evidence, including the derogatory information that Applicant included in the \nquestionnaires. While Applicant\u2019s testimony and prior statements about his finances are \ninconsistent and not totally credible, I find there is insufficient evidence for a finding that \nApplicant intentionally falsified his Security Clearance Application as alleged in the \nSOR.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n                                                          \n11 GE 1. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable to pay his \nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise both of these \npotentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n7 \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s first wife did not take care of her part of the marital debts after a \nseparation and acrimonious divorce. He was unemployed on several occasions and for \nan extended period after a shoulder injury. He currently owes more than $15,000 to a \ncredit union for loans incurred in the 1990s, and more than $7,500 for two judgments \nawarded against him in 1999. Other than these debts, his financial situation is stable. \nHowever, while these debts remain unpaid, I am unable to find that AG \u00b6 20(a) is fully \napplicable.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were exacerbated by his unemployment and his \nfirst wife\u2019s actions. These are actions that were largely beyond his control. He has not \ndone anything to pay his debts after his employment stabilized. He did not act \nresponsibly under the circumstance. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable.  \n \nApplicant has never received formal financial counseling, but he did retain an \nattorney to help him resolve discrepancies on his credit report. With the exception of the \ndebts in the SOR, his financial situation is on track. It is questionable whether all the \ndebts in the SOR are enforceable because of the statute of limitations. There are \nindications that his financial problems are being resolved and under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) \nis partially applicable \n \nApplicant paid his delinquent tax debts, but he has done nothing to pay the debts \nalleged in the SOR. At least some of the debts may be uncollectable because of the \nstatute of limitations. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not fully apply because there is insufficient \ninformation to establish that Applicant showed good faith in the resolution of his debts.12 \n                                                          \n12 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \n\n \n8 \n \nHe does however merit partial credit because of the statute of limitations.13 If Applicant\u2019s \ndebts are reduced by the statute of limitations, his potential vulnerability to improper \nfinancial inducements is also accordingly reduced.         \n \n \nApplicant initially disputed owing the debts to the credit union as alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c. Applicant\u2019s name on the credit application for the auto loan as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was not signed by him. While it is difficult to believe that Applicant \nwas totally ignorant of this loan, I find that AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to that debt. His \nsignature is on the application for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He subsequently \nadmitted owing that debt. A credit application to the credit union for another loan was \nmade in November 1996. Applicant\u2019s signature is not on the application, but the loan \nrequest is in Applicant\u2019s name only and the application states that the signature was on \nthe check. This application was to increase an existing signature loan by $974 to $9,672 \nalready owed, for a balance of $10,647. The loan was made well before Applicant \nseparated from his ex-wife and before he applied for the loan in SOR \u00b6 1.b, which \nApplicant admitted was signed by him. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable to the debts listed in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. \n \n \nApplicant states that the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.l should have \nbeen paid by Workers\u2019 Compensation. He submitted documentation that medical debts \nrelated to his shoulder injury were to be paid by Workers\u2019 Compensation. The debts \nwere not listed on the two most recent credit reports in evidence. AG \u00b6 20(e) is \napplicable to the medical debts listed in \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.l.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The \nDirective does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations \nMitigating Condition 6.  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No.  99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n13 See ISCR 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available for debts \nbeing resolved through garnishment). \n \n\n \n9 \n \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying, including AG \u00b6 16(a): \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of \nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities.\u201d Applicant omitted information from his Security Clearance \nApplication; however, there is insufficient evidence to find that it was a deliberate \nomission. No Personal Conduct disqualifying condition is raised by the evidence. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has had financial issues \nsince at least the 1990s. He was unemployed on several occasions and his ex-wife \nsignificantly contributed to his financial problems. While his finances appear otherwise \nin satisfactory shape, he has made no real effort to repay his debts. Applicant omitted \ninformation about his finances from his Security Clearance Application. There is \ninsufficient evidence that it was a deliberate omission. However, his inconsistent \nstatements and testimony about his debts are a cause of concern. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nissues.  \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.l: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nEdward W.

Baldinger, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline B, \nForeign Influence. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nOn July 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuidelines B. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 18, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December 2, \n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 8, 2008, and after coordinating \nthe date with both sides I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 13, 2009. The \nFebruary 6, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \ngovernment offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9. Applicant did not object and they were \nadmitted. The government also requested administrative notice be taken on exhibits \nmarked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I through III, which was granted. Applicant testified and \noffered Exhibits (AE) A through F. Department Counsel did not object and they were \nadmitted. Applicant also offered a post-hearing request for administrative notice of HE \nIV through HE VI. Department Counsel\u2019s response is HE VII. The request is partially \ngranted. I have considered for administrative notice purposes the source documents \nprovided as hearing exhibits by both parties. I have considered the persuasive briefs \nand the other documents that were not from official U.S. Government sources as \nevidentiary documents. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January \n26, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In \naddition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old college graduate. She was born in the U.S., is a U.S. \ncitizen, and is married to a U.S. citizen. After college, Applicant worked as a mental \nhealth counselor for approximately nine months before returning to school to become a \nparalegal in 1998. She continued to work and then attended law school at night from \n1999 to 2003, when she graduated and passed the bar. She worked for a small law firm \nfor approximately two years before joining a consulting company that has contracts with \nthe Department of Defense.1  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father was born and raised in Lebanon. He moved to the U.S. in 1970 \nto attend school. After completing his college education he worked in the U.S. for a \nperiod of time. He married his wife, a native born U.S. citizen in 1973. He became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in 1977. He does not hold a Lebanese passport, but under \nLebanese laws he is considered a Lebanese citizen and it also considers his children \ncitizens of that country, without any action on their part. It is immaterial if they do not \nhold passports or renounce their citizenship, they are still considered Lebanese citizens. \nAt one time, as a minor, Applicant held a Lebanese passport, so she could travel easily \nto Lebanon. The passport has expired and been destroyed. Her father\u2019s passport also \nhas been destroyed. Neither Applicant nor her father considers themselves dual citizens \nof the U.S. and Lebanon. Applicant\u2019s brother was born in the U.S. and has the same \ncitizenship status as Applicant. He is married to a U.S. citizen and they reside in a \nneighboring state with their ten-month old son. All of Applicant\u2019s immediate family are \ncitizens and residents of the U.S. Applicant has formally renounced her ancestral \ncitizenship. Applicant has no interest in being recognized as a Lebanese citizen and \nprofessed her loyalty only to the U.S. Applicant\u2019s father also professed his loyalty only to \nthe U.S and no other country.2  \n                                                          \n1 Tr. 31-43. \n \n2 Tr. 43-46, 53, 59-63, 94-99, 126-133, 140-143. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is employed by a Lebanese owned foundation (Foundation) \nand he serves as the president of its U.S. division. The Foundation is a non-profit \neducational foundation properly registered under the tax laws of the U.S. It is a separate \nFoundation not affiliated with any Lebanese companies. Applicant\u2019s father was asked by \na Lebanese businessman and his family to form the Foundation in 1978. The \nFoundation is nonpartisan, nonsectarian, and philanthropic. It identifies qualified and \nworthy Lebanese students wishing to study abroad and coordinates their interests and \nneeds with approximately 340 colleges and universities. The Foundation\u2019s Board of \nDirectors are American officials and members of the American business community, \nsome of whom are former senators and political appointees of the U.S. government. He \nhas been affiliated with the family and the Foundation since its founding. The U.S. \nFoundation has no contact with the Lebanese government.3  \n \nThe parent company of the Foundation is also owned by the same Lebanese \nfamily. The father of that family became the prime minister of Lebanon. He was \nassassinated in 2006. Applicant\u2019s father still has some contact with other members of \nthe family due to his responsibilities with the Foundation. One of the family members is \na member of parliament. He has some dealings with this person only as it relates to the \neducational commitments of the Foundation. The Foundation and Applicant\u2019s father do \nnot have dealings with the Lebanese government and he is not involved in any of the \npolitics of Lebanon.4  \n \nApplicant met the woman who is a member of parliament one time at a reception \nwhen she was in high school. She also met a brother of that family during trips to \nLebanon. The meetings were at large luncheon receptions of a least 20-30 people. She \ndid not have private conversations, but rather was one of many people attending. Due \nto her father\u2019s position as the president of the Foundation, he gets invited to many \nreceptions in his official capacity. These are obligatory events and he does not have \npersonal relationships with the attendees. Applicant likewise has met some dignitaries, \nbut does not have personal relationships with them.5  \n \nThe parent company of the Foundation is international in nature and has offices \nin other countries throughout the world. The parent company\u2019s headquarters are located \nin Saudi Arabia. Applicant\u2019s father sits on the Board of Directors and Executive Board of \nthe parent company and consults on policy issues regarding the financial aspects of the \ncompany. The parent company is a privately held company, owned by the same \nLebanese family that owns the Foundation and does not have any government affiliation \nor ties with any country. The company has clients worldwide. Applicant travels to Saudi \nArabia when there is a Board of Director\u2019s meeting.6  \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n3 Tr. 46-59, 100-112, 133-135, 144-149. \n \n4 Tr. 100-112, 144-153. \n \n5 Tr. 54-59, 100-112, 133-139, 149-153, 158-162. \n \n6 Tr. 101, 133-139, 144-153. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father\u2019s contact with the parliamentary family member is not political, \nbut rather because of her interest in the continuing success of the Foundation. \nApplicant\u2019s father may see her at social events, but she is not a personal friend. He \ntravels to Lebanon several times a year due to Foundation\u2019s business and board \nmeetings. While there he will visit family that still lives in Lebanon.7  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father at one time owned land in Lebanon that was titled in both of his \nchildren\u2019s names. Until recently, Applicant was unaware that there was land in her \nname. Her father sold the land and no longer owns any land in Lebanon. Applicant does \nnot have any financial interests in Lebanon, nor does any of the rest of her immediate \nfamily. All of Applicant\u2019s parent\u2019s assets are in the U.S.8  \n \nApplicant has a large extended family, both in the U.S. and abroad. Her father \nhas seven siblings who have various citizenships, including U.S., Lebanese, and \nFrench, who live in various countries around the world, to include the U.S., Lebanon, \nFrance and Saudi Arabia. These seven siblings collectively have 25 children with the \nsame citizenships and residences, plus some others residences in Qatar, Canada, and \nthe United Arab Emirates. Applicant\u2019s mother has four brothers and collectively 13 \nchildren, all of whom are U.S. born citizens.  \n \nApplicant has had sporadic contact with different relatives in her extended family. \nWhen she lived with her parents she had more frequent contact and received updates \non her relatives. She is not close to her overseas relatives. She exchanged emails with \nsome family members a few times a year. Since her marriage she only has occasional \nphysical contact with relatives living in the U.S. and none with those overseas. Her \nemail contact is also less frequent. \n \nApplicant traveled to Lebanon during several summer vacations when she was in \nhigh school and college. Her last trip was in 2003 for a weekend to attend a cousin\u2019s \nwedding and later the same summer for another cousin\u2019s wedding.  \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s family members on her mother\u2019s side are U.S. citizens residing \nin the U.S.  \n \nApplicant has two cousins from her father\u2019s side who are U.S. citizens residing in \nthe U.S. One other cousin lives in the U.S. and is in the process of obtaining a green \ncard. Three cousins are citizens and residents of France. One uncle is a U.S. citizen \nwho splits his residence between the U.S. and Lebanon. One cousin is a citizen and \nresident of Canada.9  \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n7 Tr. 56-59, 100-109, 133-139, 149-153. \n \n8 Tr. 63-64, 99-100, 113, 124-126, 140, 157. \n \n9 Tr. 65-89, 115-121. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s other uncles and aunts are citizens and residents of Lebanon. She \nalso has cousins who are citizens and residents of Lebanon.10  \n \n \nApplicant has a cousin who is a citizen of Lebanon and resides in the U.A.E.11 \n \n \nApplicant has five cousins who are citizens of Lebanon and reside in Saudi \nArabia.12 \n \n \nApplicant has a cousin who is a citizen of Lebanon and resides in Qatar.13 \n \n \nApplicant has a cousin who is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Lebanon. Her \ncousin\u2019s wife is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Tunisia. They reside in the U.S.14  \n \n \nApplicant has a cousin who is a Palestinian national, has a U.S. green card and \nresides in the U.S.15 \n \n \nApplicant has another cousin whose wife is a dual citizen of the U.S. and \nLebanon. She also has three cousins who are citizens of Lebanon and currently reside \nin the U.S.16  \n \n \nApplicant knows who her relatives are and except for a few cousins around her \nage, she has minimal contact with many of them and no contact with others. She may \nhear about their well-being from her father, but only in a customary family situation. She \ntraveled to Lebanon twice in 2003 to attend two cousins\u2019 weddings. The two cousins \nshe considers herself closer to than other cousins. Some of her other cousins she has \nhad no contact with at all.17  \n \n \nNone of Applicant\u2019s family members work for the governments of their countries \nor other countries. She has two cousins that she is closer to than the others because \nthey are close in age and were in the U.S. for awhile when Applicant was growing up so \nshe got to know them. The last time she saw one was in 2007 when he came to the U.S \nfor a visit and she saw him for a day. The other cousin she has not seen since 2003. All \n                                                          \n10 Id. \n \n11 Id. \n \n12 Id. \n \n13 Id. \n \n14 Id. \n \n15 Id. \n \n16 Id. \n \n17 Tr. 65-89, 90-91, 97, 115-121. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nof her other cousins she has no physical contact with. She does not telephone them and \nhas only very occasional email contact, usually to send a photo.18 \n \n \nApplicant credibly testified that although she has relatives that live in Lebanon \nand it is half of her ancestral heritage, she has no loyalty to the country and would not \ndo anything to compromise her loyalty to the U.S., even if requested by a relative. She \nalso credibly testified she would not do anything regarding her father\u2019s business that \nwould conflict with the U.S. interests.19  \n \n \nApplicant provided character witnesses who testified on her behalf. She also \nprovided character letters from people who know her and who hold top secret \nclearances and access to sensitive compartmented information. They attest to her \nloyalty, professionalism, trustworthiness, reliability, honesty, dedication, diligence, \nmaturity, responsibility and ethics. I have considered all of the letters.20 \n \nLebanon21 \n \nLebanon is a parliamentary democracy in which people have the constitutional \nright to change their government. Due to civil war the exercise of political rights were \nprecluded until 1992. Lebanon has a free-market economy and a strong laissez-faire \ncommercial tradition. The economy is service-oriented. The U.S. enjoys a strong \nexporter position with Lebanon and is its fifth largest source of imported goods. More \nthan 160 offices representing U.S. businesses operate in Lebanon. Since the lifting of \npassport restrictions in 1997, a number of large U.S. companies have opened branch or \nregional offices in Lebanon.  \n \nThe foreign policy of Lebanon reflects its geographic location, the composition of \nits population and its reliance on commerce and trade. Its foreign policy is heavily \ninfluenced by neighboring Syria, which has also long influenced Lebanon\u2019s internal \npolicies as well. Lebanon, like most Arab states, does not recognize Israel, with which it \nhas been technically at war since Israel\u2019s establishment.  \n \nLebanon has had some human rights problems including the arbitrary arrest and \ndetainment of individuals and instances of arbitrary and unlawful deprivation of life, \ntorture and other abuses. \n \nThe terrorist group Hezbollah is a Lebanese-based radical Shi\u2019a group and is \ndesignated by the U.S. as a \u201cForeign Terrorist Organization.\u201d The Lebanese \ngovernment recognizes Hezbollah as a \u201clegitimate resistance group\u201d and political party \n                                                          \n18 Tr.141-142. \n \n19 Tr. 92-94. \n \n20 AE A, B, C, D, and E Tr. 121-124, 167-180. \n \n21 HE I and IV. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nand until recently was represented by elected officials in the Lebanese parliament. \nHezbollah also provides support to several Palestinian terrorist organizations and is \nknown to be involved in numerous anti-US. and anti-Israeli terrorist attacks. Americans \nhave been the targets of numerous terrorist attacks in Lebanon.  \n \n \nThe United States seeks to maintain its traditionally close ties with Lebanon and \nto help preserve its independence, sovereignty, national unity and territorial integrity. \nThe U.S. provides more than $400 million in aid to Lebanon and pledged $1 billion in \nadditional aid. The aid reflects the importance the U.S. attaches to Lebanon\u2019s \ndevelopment as a unified, independent and sovereign country. \n \n \nU.S. citizens who also possess Lebanese nationality may be subject to laws that \nimpose special obligations on them as Lebanese citizens. Presently there is a travel \nwarning for U.S. citizens traveling to Lebanon due to the threat against westerners. \n \nSaudi Arabia22 \n \n \nSaudi Arabia is a monarchy ruled by the Al Saud Family. The government is the \nmonarchy and there are no political parties or national elections. There are significant \nhuman rights problems, including no right to peacefully change the government, \ninfliction of severe pain by judicially sanctioned punishment, beatings and other abuses. \nSome prisoners are subjected to torture, abuse, violence, and forced confessions.  \n \nThe U.S. and Saudi Arabia share a common concern about security, oil exports \nand imports and sustainable developments. In addition to economic ties there is a \nlongstanding security relationship that continues to be important to the U.S.-Saudi \nrelationship. The U.S. military provides training and support in the use of weapons and \nother security\u2013related services to the Saudi armed forces. There are serious concerns \nregarding terrorist activity by Saudis against westerns. Individuals and organizations \nbased in Saudi Arabia have been designated by the U.S. government as providing \nfinancial and material support to Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups. The Saudi \ngovernment has confronted terrorism and extremist ideologies and has frozen assets \nand enforced travel bans on certain of their citizens.  \n \nUnited Arab Emirate23 \n \n \nThe United Arab Emirates is located in the Persian Gulf region, and it is a \nfederation of emirates, each with its own ruler. The federal government is a \nconstitutional republic headed by a president and council of ministers. There are no \ndemocratically elected legislative institutions or political parties, and no general election. \nOnly 15-20% of the U.A.E.\u2019s population are U.A.E. citizens. \n \n                                                          \n22 HE II and V. \n \n23 AE III and IV. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nThe U.A.E. contributes to the continued security and stability of the Gulf and the \nStraits of Hormuz. It is a leading partner in the campaign against global terrorism, \nproviding assistance in military, diplomatic, and financial arenas since September 11, \n2001. U.A.E is a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Following Iraq\u2019s \ninvasion and attempted annexation of Kuwait, the U.A.E. has sought to rely on the \nGCC, the United States and other Western allies for its security. The U.A.E. believes \nthat the Arab League needs to be restructured to become a viable institution and would \nlike to increase strength and interoperability of the GCC defense forces.  \n \n \nThe U.S. and U.A.E. have enjoyed friendly relations since 1971. Private \ncommercial ties, especially oil, have developed into friendly government-to-government \nties which include security assistance. The U.S. and U.A.E. relations increased \ndramatically when the U.S. led the campaign to end Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. The \nU.S. and U.A.E. launched a strategic partnership and it has been a key partner in the \nWar on Terror. U.A.E. ports host more U.S. Navy ships than any port outside the U.S. \nThe U.S. was the third country to establish formal diplomatic relations with the U.A.E. \nand has had an ambassador resident in the U.A.E. since 1974.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \n\n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and especially considered the following:  \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \n\n \n10 \n \n \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and  \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation.  \nApplicant has many extended family members who are citizens of Lebanon and \nreside in Lebanon and other countries, including Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. She has \nsome contact with some of these family members. She has attended weddings of two \ncousins. There is no evidence to suggest that her limited contact with her extended \nfamily that are not U.S. citizens and reside in other countries creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion. All of her \nimmediate family are U.S. citizens residing in the U.S. Her father works for the U.S. \nDivision of a Foundation that provides educational opportunities to Lebanese students. \nThere is no question he has business contacts in other countries, but there is no \nevidence that his business in any way creates a heightened risk. He sits on the Board of \nDirectors of a parent company that has its headquarters in Saudi Arabia. However, \nthere is no evidence that these business entities create a heightened risk or have ties to \na foreign government. Applicant\u2019s father has been a U.S. citizen for more than 30 years. \nApplicant and none of her immediate family have financial interests in any foreign \ncountry. Her connections to her foreign relatives do not create a potential conflict of \ninterest between Applicant and her relatives or her ancestral country. Applicant has \nmany family members who are U.S. citizens, by birth and by choice. None of them work \nfor foreign governments. I have considered all of the disqualifying conditions and \nconclude none apply.  \nIn an abundance of caution, I have also analyzed all of the facts and considered \nall of the mitigating conditions for this security concern under AG \u00b6 8 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization and interests of the U.S.;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and  \n\n \n11 \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.  \nApplicant was born in the U.S. and has lived her entire life in the U.S. Like most \nAmericans she has ancestral ties to other countries. Her father has been a naturalized \ncitizen for more than 30 years and works for a Foundation that although it has ties to a \nfamily in Lebanon, it is a U.S. entity. There was no evidence to suggest that he is \ninfluenced by the politics of Lebanon. Merely knowing people from other countries does \nnot create a heightened risk. Applicant has a large extended family, on both her father\u2019s \nand mother\u2019s side of the family. She does not know those that live in other countries \nvery well and hears updates of their well-being only occasionally from her father. Others \nshe is closer to depending on whether they spent time in the U.S. or if they are closer in \nher age. None are employed by the country where they are either citizens of or reside \nin. The countries noted have some issues with human rights. Her relatives do not have \njobs or contacts with the government where they are citizens or reside. It is unlikely that \nApplicant would be placed in a position of having to choose between the interest of a \ndistant relative or her father\u2019s business and the U.S. It is very clear that even in the \nunlikely event such a situation would arise she would choose the interests of the U.S. \nTherefore, I find (a) applies.  \nI have considered all of the facts and it is abundantly clear there is no conflict of \ninterest because of Applicant\u2019s complete and undivided loyalty to the U.S. She has no \nloyalty to any other country and never has. The diversity and the number of different \ncountries that Applicant has some family ties also decreases the likelihood that she \nwould harbor a sense of obligation to a distant relative living in a country she has never \nhad ties to. Or in the case of Lebanon, her ties are to her cultural heritage and not to the \npolicies of its government, much like most Americans. Even if there was remote \npossibility of a conflict of interest, it is clear Applicant would unequivocally resolve all \npotential conflicts of interests in favor of the U.S. Hence I find (b) applies. \nApplicant\u2019s contact with her relatives in other countries is infrequent and although \nsomewhat sentimental, it is casual. She has not divorced herself from acknowledging \nthat she has a large family who lives all over the world. She can not control her family \nties, but it does not diminish her loyalty to her country. Applicant does not deny her ties \nto her father\u2019s side of her family, but many of those ties have some type of foot hold in \nthe U.S. either by living in the U.S. or they are citizens, or they have green cards, etc. \nAlso noted are the ties she has on her maternal side of the family. The sheer number \nand complexity of the different relationships with both sides of her family reduces any \nissues that would create a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation. \nTherefore, I find (c) also applies. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n12 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was born, educated and \nlived in the U.S. her entire life. She has many relatives; many are citizens of the U.S.; \nmany are citizens of Lebanon; and some are citizens of other countries. The one \nconstant of her international family is Applicant\u2019s loyalty to her country, the U.S. Her \nfather adopted the U.S. as his country. His job allows him to have contacts with foreign \ncitizens of different countries. Those contacts are part of every international business \nventure. Applicant\u2019s internationally diverse family, their citizenry and residency is broad. \nHer entire mother\u2019s side of the family are citizens and residents of the U.S. Many of her \nfather\u2019s side of the family have connections to the U.S., either as citizens, residents, or \ngreen card holders. Saudi Arabia has strong ties with the U.S., but there have been \nissues of their commitment to fight terrorism. Lebanon equally has a strong relationship \nwith the U.S., but also has terrorist factions. The U.A.E. is a committed U.S. ally. I \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s maturity, demeanor and credibility. I found her testimony to be \nsincere and thoughtful. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Appellant has mitigated the security concerns arising from the foreign \ninfluence security concerns raised under guideline B. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.r: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

On April 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 8, 2008. He answered the\nSOR in writing on April 18, 2008, and requested a hearing before an administrative\nAugust 20, 2008\n\n2\njudge. DOHA received the request on April 21, 2008. Department Counsel was\nprepared to proceed on April 29, 2008. DOHA assigned the case to another\nadministrative judge on May 2, 2008. Because of workload considerations, the case\nwas reassigned to me on May 20, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 9,\n2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 1, 2008. The government\noffered six exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were received and admitted into evidence\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He submitted one exhibit (AE) A,\nwhich was received and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 15, 2008. I held the record open until July 31,\n2008, for Applicant to submit additional matters.  On July 31, 2008, he submitted six\nexhibits, marked AE B through G. The government objected to the admission of AE B\nonly on the grounds of hearsay. AE C through G are admitted without objection. The\nrecord closed on July 31, 2008.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nThe administrative file reflects that Applicant received the hearing notice on June\n18, 2008, less than 15 days prior to the hearing. At the hearing, I advised Applicant of\nhis right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to receive the hearing notice 15 days before the\nhearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice. (Tr. at 10) \nMotion to Amend SOR\nNear the end of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by\nadding \u00b6 1.e, alleging Applicant is indebted to the Veteran\u2019s Administration (VA) in the\namount of $14,000. (Tr. at 73) Applicant objected to the motion, arguing that he does\nnot owe the VA any money. Rather, if he wishes to again be eligible for a future VA\nbacked mortgage, he must repay the VA the money it paid to his mortgagor. I denied\nthe motion to amend the SOR because there is no existing debt with the VA based on\nthe credit reports and Applicant\u2019s testimony. (Tr. at 77)\nEvidentiary Rulings\nDepartment Counsel challenges the admission of AE B, an undated letter from\nApplicant on the grounds of hearsay. Since the hearsay rules are not strictly applied in\nthese proceedings, the objection is overruled. AE B is admitted into evidence. I will\naccord this document whatever weight to which it is entitled.\n\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR, dated April 18, 2008, at 1.\n1\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s e-QIP) at 1, 5-8; Tr. 13, 16-18, 72.\n2\nTr. 32-39.\n3\nAE A (Bankruptcy documents) at 1-2,10; Tr. 18-24.\n4\n3\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR,\nwith explanations. He also provided additional information to support his request for\neligibility for a security clearance.   \n1\nApplicant, who is 47-years-old, works for a Department of Defense contractor as\na senior mechanical technician. He began this job in 2005. From 2001 until 2005, he\ndrove a truck, owning and operating his own business for the last three years. He retired\nfrom the U.S. Army as a staff sergeant (E-6) in 2001. He is a disabled veteran. He held\na clearance while in the Army and acted as a courier of classified information. He\nmarried 19 years ago. He has a grown stepson, two teenage children and one\ngrandchild.2\nPrior to his retirement from the military, he and a military colleague decided to\nstart a business, which they never incorporated. In their business, they purchased\ntrucks in need of some repairs. They would repair a truck then resell it. Applicant used\npersonal credit cards and a personal line of credit with a bank (the creditor in SOR \u00b6\n1.b) in the form of 90-day short-term loans to finance his business. He would purchase\nused trucks for $2,500 to $3,500, using the bank loan. The bank held title to the truck.\nApplicant and his partner would repair the trucks for about $500 then resell the trucks\nfor about $4500. Each time he sold a truck, he repaid the loan on this truck and the\nbank returned the title it held on the truck. If the loan was not repaid, the bank listed it as\nan automobile repossession on the credit report.3\nBy December 1999, Applicant had developed serious financial problems with his\nbusiness. His sales of repaired trucks had slowed and he could not pay his loans. In\nMarch 2000, he filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. His creditors included the bank listed in\nSOR \u00b6 1.b. The bankruptcy court discharged his debts in an Order dated June 29,\n2000.   \n4\nHe and his wife purchased a small house in 1994, which they outgrew quickly.\nInstead of selling this house, they decided to rent it. They purchased and moved to a\nlarger house in 1996. In 2002, Applicant allowed his stepson and his girlfriend to move\ninto the smaller house with the agreement they would pay all expenses. However,\nApplicant either paid the electric bill or the mortgage each month for his stepson.\nEventually, he stopped paying both and directed his stepson to pay both. His stepson\nfailed to make the mortgage payments as required. When Applicant and his wife\nlearned that the bank had started foreclosure, they mailed the overdue payments to the\n\nGE 4 (Credit Report, dated April 29, 2008); GE 5 (Credit Report, dated September 20, 2007); GE 6 (Credit\n5\nreport, dated January 28, 2006); AE F (Credit report, dated July 28, 2008); AE G (Credit report, dated July 22,\n2008); Tr. 45-50, 77. \nGE 4, supra note 5; GE 5, supra note 5; GE 6, supra note 5; AE F, supra note 5; AE G, supra note 5, at 2;\n6\nTr. 27-31, 52-59.\n4\nbank. The bank declined their payments and foreclosed. Since the VA guaranteed their\nloan, it paid the mortgage balance to the bank. As a result, Applicant lost his eligibility\nfor a VA loan. He can regain his eligibility for a VA guaranteed mortgage loan if he\nrepays the VA. He is not required by the VA to repay the loan and no debt to the VA is\nlisted on his credit reports in the record.5\nPrior to filing bankruptcy, Applicant and his wife purchased a time share\nsometime in 1998 and 1999. The purchase contract guaranteed them two full weeks a\nyear access to one of the time share properties anywhere and regular weekend access\nto local properties. The agreement also included certain amenities and services. During\nthe two years they were involved with the time share, they used it four weekends locally.\nWhenever they sought to exercise their right to use their two weeks, no facilities were\navailable, except at a higher grade. The time share company regularly offered to\nupgrade their purchase, which they did once. The availability of the two weeks did not\nimprove with the upgrade nor did the services available.  They spoke with company\nrepresentative several times and received promises for improvements, which never\noccurred. During this time, other purchasers had filed a class action law suit against the\ntime share company. Applicant chose not to participate in the law suit, in part because\nof the promises. Finally, after many broken promises and the lack of availability of their\ntime share property, Applicant told the company to sell his interest in the time share\nbecause he believed that the company had not honored their contractual agreement.\nAlthough Applicant threatened to sue the time share company, he did not. He believes\nhis share was sold, but is not sure. He never received a notice that he owed the time\nshare company money. This time share company is now out of business. Applicant has\nchallenged this debt, which is listed on only two of the five credit reports of record. The\nJuly 22, 2008 credit report indicates that this account is being investigated, which\nreflects that Applicant challenged the validity of the debt, which he does not intend to\npay.6\nThe three 2008 credit reports indicate that Applicant timely pays his current bills\nand has no outstanding balances on his present debts. The July 28, 2008 and April 29,\n2008 credit reports reflect that the mortgage debt set forth SOR \u00b6 1.c is a VA real estate\nmortgage with a zero balance. Concerning the $3,686 bank loan in SOR \u00b6 1.b, the 2007\nand 2006 credit reports show several loans with this creditor, all of which are paid\nexcept one. The credit reports show that the unpaid account, which is listed in the SOR,\nwas opened in December 1999 and that Applicant disputed the account in 2006. The\ndispute resolution is not shown; however, the debt is not listed on any of the 2008 credit\n\nGE 4, supra note 5; GE 5, supra note 5; GE 6, supra note 5; AE F, supra note 5; AE G, supra note 5, at 2;\n7\nAE D.\nAE C (Applicant\u2019s monthly budget); Tr. 16-17.\n8\n5\nreports. I find that Applicant successfully challenged the listing of this debt, which was\nincluded in his 2000 bankruptcy.7\nApplicant and his wife have a net monthly income of $8,563 from their earnings,\nhis military retirement, and his VA disability benefit. Their monthly expenses total\n$3,377, leaving $5,186 of available income each month. One daughter is in college.8\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\n\n6\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt in 1999 when he was\noperating his truck repair business. He discharged his debts in bankruptcy in 2000.\nSince then, he has been involved in two foreclosure proceedings and has one unpaid\ndebt. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions,\nrequiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose from his truck repair business in 1999. He resolved these debts\nissues through bankruptcy, a process which included the debts to the bank listed in\nSOR \u00b6 1.b. Since his bankruptcy discharge, he has paid all his credit card bills, his car\nloans, his usual household expenses and current mortgage. I find his bankruptcy\noccurred because of his now defunct truck repair business and the costs related to\noperating this business, which is unlikely to recur. It does not raise concerns about his\n\nAG \u00b6 20(f) does not apply in this case.\n9\n7\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. This potentially mitigating condition\napplies only to the issue of bankruptcy and the one discharged bank debt. \nUnder AG & 20(b), Applicant may mitigate where Athe conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted\nabove, Applicant\u2019s financial problems arose from his 1999 business problems, when\nsales declined, thus, severely limiting his ability to pay his loans and credit cards. He\nhas closed his business and eliminated it as a source of financial problems. The\nforeclosure on his little house occurred when his stepson failed to pay his rent, which\nwas the mortgage. The bank refused to accept the back payments from Applicant.\nBecause the VA guaranteed this loan, the VA paid the debt. Applicant is not indebted to\nthe VA, but if he wishes to regain his eligibility for a future VA loan, he must repay the\nVA the amount it paid on his foreclosure loan. I find this potentially mitigating condition\nis a factor for consideration in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant has not received any counseling\nabout his debt issues and does not need it since his debts are resolved. He is current in\nall his bills and now has a good credit record. Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ This mitigating condition does not apply in this case.\nFinally, Appellant may mitigate the government\u2019s security concern under AG \u00b6\n20(e), which states that [if] an individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the\nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue. Appellant successfully disputed the bank debt listed on his\n2006 and 2007. This unpaid debt has been removed from his credit reports. This\nmitigating condition has some applicability.9\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate\nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\n\n8\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Appellant\u2019s problems first began,\nwhile he was still in the military. He and a friend decided to develop a business which\nwould provide them with work and an income when they retired, even though they had\nlittle business experience. Because of their lack of business experience, they not only\ndid not incorporate the business, they did not understand the financial liability for not\nincorporating the business. As a result, they financed the business with Applicant\u2019s\ngood credit history, and when the business absorbed his personal income, Applicant\nfinanced his living expenses with his credit cards. These financial decisions led\nApplicant to file for bankruptcy when business sales slowed and he could not pay his\nbills. His business ended when he filed bankruptcy. Since 2000, he has managed his\npersonal finances and his second trucking business prudently.\nAs a parent and in an effort to help his stepson, Applicant allowed his stepson\nand his girl friend to live in the small house with the understanding that they would pay\nall the bills related to this property. They did not, and as a result, the mortgagor\nforeclosed on the property, despite Applicant\u2019s efforts to pay the delinquent payments.\nBecause it was a VA guaranteed loan, the VA paid the mortgage balance and denied\nApplicant access to future VA loans. Applicant\u2019s efforts to catch up the mortgage\npayments was reasonable and the rejection of his offer by the mortgage company is not\nwithin his control. Applicant has always paid his other house mortgage in a timely\nfashion. Applicant\u2019s decision not to pay the money owed on the time share is\nreasonable in light of his belief that the time share company breached its contract with\nhim. While he had the option to sue the time share company in court, such actions are\ntime consuming, expensive and stressful. His decision not to pursue legal action in light\nof these factors is reasonable.\nIn considering the totality of the evidence in this record, all the debts listed in the\nSOR, except the time share debt, are resolved. Applicant held a security clearance for\nmany years as an active duty soldier, and never violated his responsibilities. Except for\nhis decision to run a business in the late 1990s with a friend, Applicant has always\nmanaged his finances prudently and wisely. He lives well within his financial means. His\ncontinued problem with the time share company is not sufficient to raise security\nconcerns. (See AG \u00b6 2(a)(1).)\n\n9\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The other two involve minor discrepancies as to the dates\nof several offenses which occurred in the mid-1990s.\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.32.1. \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607,\n620, (1966).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security\nconcern are based on substantial evidence and are sustainable.  Applicant has not identified any\nharmful error likely to change the outcome of the case.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2\n(App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).\n(2) Applicant also contends that the favorable evidence in the record was sufficient, as a\nmatter of law, to overcome any security concerns presented by his history of alcohol abuse.\nApplicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious or\ncontrary to law.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-05632 at 2 (App. Bd. May 13, 2008).\n\nA review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant conditions and factors.  He found in favor of Applicant under Guideline E\nand with respect to several of the factual allegations under Guideline G.  However, he reasonably\nexplained why the evidence which Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The\nfavorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep.\n4, 2007).  The Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his\ndecision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). \u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Accordingly, the\nJudge\u2019s adverse decision is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y. Ra\u2019anan     \nMichael Y.

Applicant answered the SOR 4 April 2008, and requested a\n1\nhearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 10 June 2008, and I convened a hearing 14\nJuly 2008.

The most recent incident, a November 2007 DUI (.20 %\n2\nB.A.C.) arrest that was still pending when the SOR was drafted, was resolved 24 March\n2008. Contrary to his plea, Applicant was convicted of DUI. The pertinent portion of his\nsentence was a year in jail, suspended for a year, and 18 months supervised probation\nconditioned on 1) total abstention from alcohol, 2) drug/alcohol evaluation, testing, and\ntreatment as directed by his probation officer, and 3) enrolment and successful\ncompletion of a program at a designated counseling center. Applicant\u2019s probation runs\nuntil 24 September 2009.\nApplicant\u2019s other alcohol incidents include a February 1978 (age 16) open\ncontainer offense, vehicle operation offenses in November 1980, April 1986, March\n1987, January 1995, and September 2005, a November 1995 arrest for \u201cmooning\u201d at a\nfootball game, and a July 1998 boating while intoxicated (BWI, .249 B.A.C.). As a result\nof his September 2005 offense, Applicant received probation before judgment, but\nattended alcohol counseling from January 2006 to September 2006.  He resumed\nalcohol counseling with a different provider in November 2007 as a result of that\noffense. \nIn January 2008, Applicant entered the state-certified and approved alcohol\nabusers counseling program, and began counseling sessions in February 2008. He has\nsuccessfully completed requirements up to July 2008, and has tested negative on\ndrug/alcohol screens. No diagnosis or prognosis has been given (A.E. C). He expects to\nhave his exit interview from the program soon.\nApplicant attends AA twice weekly and is working a 12-step program. He does\nnot currently have a sponsor. He voluntarily installed an ignition interlock system in his\ncar. He has not consumed alcohol since his November 2007 arrest. However,\nabstinence has been required as a condition of his probation since March 2008. In\naddition, in the 30 years that Applicant has abused alcohol, he has experienced gaps\nbetween alcohol-related incidents of six years, eight years, and seven years, as well as\nshorter, but still significant, periods.\nApplicant does not consider himself an alcoholic or alcohol abuser. He has not\nbeen diagnosed as alcohol dependent or an alcohol abuser. He wants to remain sober\nfor his five-year-old daughter.\nApplicant is alleged to have falsified a May 2003 public trust application (G.E. 7)\nby failing to disclose the July 1998 BWI arrest and the November 1995 \u201cmooning\u201d\narrest. Applicant testified credibly that he simply forgot these two arrests. Applicant is\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n3\nalso alleged to have falsified his September 2007 answers to interrogatories (G.E. 4)\nwhen he denied having ever used illegal drugs. However, the record shows that\nApplicant last used marijuana in the mid-1980s, and he illegally possessed marijuana in\nJanuary 1995. \nApplicant\u2019s employment references (A.E. A, B) consider him honest and reliable. \nHowever, it is not clear how much they are aware of the SOR allegations. \nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline\nG (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.3\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline G, by\ndemonstrating Applicant\u2019s 30-year history of alcohol abuse, punctuated by nine alcohol-\nrelated arrests in February 1978, November 1980, April 1986, March 1987, January\n\n\u00b622.(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or\n4\nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; . . . (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the\npoint of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent;\n\u00b623.(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual\n5\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n\u00b623.(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of\n6\nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent)\nor responsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n\u00b623.(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or treatment program, has\n7\nno history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress;\n\u00b623.(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along\n8\nwith any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, . . . and has received a favorable prognosis by\na duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized\nalcohol treatment program.\n\u00b616.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\n9\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or]\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .; (b) deliberately providing false or misleading\ninformation regarding relevant facts to an . . . investigator . . .;\n4\n1995, November 1995, July 1998, September 2005, and November 2007.  Applicant\n4\nfailed to mitigate the security concerns. The fact that his probation runs until September\n2009, coupled with the fact that he has previously had multiple-year periods of sobriety,\nmilitates against concluding that he is unlikely to engage in future alcohol abuse.\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions under Guideline G. His alcohol\nabuse was recent, frequent, and not under unusual circumstances.  Beyond the vaguest\n5\nacknowledgment of past mistakes with alcohol, Applicant has not acknowledged his\nobvious alcohol abuse. His actions taken to overcome the problem seem limited to his\nAA attendance, the progress of which is insufficiently documented. On this record,\nApplicant is unable to establish either a pattern of abstinence or responsible use given\nhis probationary status.  While he is apparently making satisfactory progress in his\n6\ncurrent counseling program, he relapsed from a previous counseling program ordered\nas a result of his September 2005 DUI.  Finally, Applicant lacks the kind of program,\n7\ntrack record, and prognosis that would demonstrate that his alcohol problems are\nbehind him.  I cannot conclude Applicant is unlikely to abuse alcohol in the future.\n8\nAccordingly, I resolve Guideline G for Applicant.\nThe government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline E.9\nApplicant credibly testified that he simply forgot the two arrests he omitted from his May\n2003 application for a public trust position. As to his September 2007 interrogatory\nanswers, his mid-1980s marijuana use and his January 1995 marijuana possession\n\n5\nwere neither relevant nor material to a clearance determination. I resolve Guideline E\nfor Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, dated December 18, 2007, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the SOR, with explanation, including a change in some dates. Applicant, who is 31 years old, works for a Department of Defense contractor as a draftsman. He started working for the contractor five years ago. He completed his security clearance application on January 5, 2007.1 Applicant dropped out of high school in the 9 grade. He obtained employment in th the construction industry as an installer. Later, he worked as an autobody technician.2 Applicant began drinking at age 15 sporadically. He liked to party and to drink alcohol. By age 18, he drank alcohol daily. He generally consumed beer, on average 6- 10 beers a day. Occasionally, he drank liquor. He never missed work as a result of his alcohol consumption, but he arrived late to work occasionally. He also used marijuana.3 In 1995, the police observed him driving and noticed an air freshener on his rear view mirror. The police stopped him and searched his car. The police found marijuana joints in the ashtray and arrested him for possession of marijuana. He appeared in court. The court fined him, directed he attend substance abuse classes and placed him on probation for one year.

I convened the hearing on March 5, 2008, the\nMarch 28, 2008\n\nGE 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated January 5, 2007) at 1, 8-9; Tr. 18-20, 40.\n1\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 9-16; Tr. 19.\n2\nGE 3 (Answers to Interrogatories, dated September 10, 2007) at 8, 16; Tr. 22-24.\n3\nGE 2 (United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, criminal record report) at 2; GE\n4\n3, supra note 3, at 5; Tr. 24-25.\n2\nscheduled date, but at an earlier time. The government withdrew allegation 1.g. The\ngovernment offered three exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant and four witnesses testified on his behalf. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 14, 2008. I held the record open for two weeks\nto submit additional matters.  On March 11, 2008, Applicant submitted one exhibit (AE\n1), without objection. The record closed on March 19, 2008. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated December 18, 2007, Applicant admitted all the\nfactual allegations in the SOR, with explanation, including a change in some dates.\nApplicant, who is 31 years old, works for a Department of Defense contractor as\na draftsman. He started working for the contractor five years ago. He completed his\nsecurity clearance application on January 5, 2007.1\nApplicant dropped out of high school in the 9  grade. He obtained employment in\nth\nthe construction industry as an installer. Later, he worked as an autobody technician.2\nApplicant began drinking at age 15 sporadically. He liked to party and to drink\nalcohol. By age 18, he drank alcohol daily. He generally consumed beer, on average 6-\n10 beers a day. Occasionally, he drank liquor. He never missed work as a result of his\nalcohol consumption, but he arrived late to work occasionally. He also used marijuana.3\nIn 1995, the police observed him driving and noticed an air freshener on his rear\nview mirror. The police stopped him and searched his car. The police found marijuana\njoints in the ashtray and arrested him for possession of marijuana. He appeared in\ncourt. The court fined him, directed he attend substance abuse classes and placed him\non probation for one year. He complied with the terms of his sentence.4\nApproximately two years later, in November 1997, after a day of drinking with\nfriends at his house, he decided to leave his house. He drove down the road near his\nhouse, lost control of his car and hit a tree. A friend took him home. He left the car at the\naccident scene.  The police arrived at his house a short time later, escorted him back to\nhis car, and arrested him for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). The court\nbased his sentence on first offender status. The court fined him $1,000, suspended his\n\nGE 2, supra note 4, at 2; GE 3, supra note 3, at 5, 17; Tr. 26-27.\n5\nThe record contains conflicting evidence about the date of Applicant\u2019s second DUI arrest. His statement to\n6\nthe investigator contains a reference to a DUI arrest in April 2001 and another arrest in July 2001. The factual\nscenario in the statement for both arrests is identical as is the charges and sentence. This factual summary\nis clearly in error. The criminal records report also contains inaccurate information. Given that Applicant admits\nto three DUI arrests, I find his testimony about the dates of these arrest credible. \nGE 2, supra note 4, at 2; GE 3, supra note 3, at 5; Tr. 29-30.\n7\nGE 3, supra note 3, at 5; Tr. 29.\n8\nGE 2, supra note 4, at 2; GE 3, supra note 3, at 5, 16-17; Tr. 30-31.\n9\nApplicant denies being arrested for marijuana possession in June 2001 because such an arrest would have\n10\nbeen his third felony arrest. Under the state\u2019s statutes, a third felony arrest would have resulted in a  sentence\nto life in prison. Tr. 34.\n3\ndrivers license for one year and directed he attend substance abuses classes. He paid\nthe fine and attended the classes. He, however, continued to drive, even though his\nlicense had been suspended.5\nIn 1998 or 1999, but not in 2001, the police arrested him a second time for DUI.6\nWith his friends, he had been driving his car in mud, in an activity called rooting. On his\nway home, his car transmission broke. He fell asleep in the car with the engine running\nso that he had heat in the car. The police woke him and charged him with DUI. The\ncourt sentenced him to 90 days in jail, suspending 88 days; fined him $1,000; directed\nhe attend additional substance abuse programs; and suspended his drivers license for\nthree years. Again, he complied with the terms of his sentence, except he continued to\ndrive his car on a suspended license.7\nIn April 2000, he and friends spent the afternoon drinking alcohol. He left his\nfriend\u2019s house and drove into the drive through lane of a McDonald\u2019s. He passed out in\nthe drive through lane. Since he was on private property, the police could not charge\nhim with DUI. The police arrested him for public drunkenness, took him to jail, and\nimpounded his car. The court fined him $50.8\nOne year later, on April 8, 2001, after an evening of drinking with friends,\nApplicant drove home. He has little recall about the subsequent events, but testified\nbased on the information given him and in the police report. An off-duty police officer\nobserved him driving erratically and called in a report.  Another police officer stopped\nhim, determined that he was intoxicated and arrested him. He spend the night in jail.\nThe police charged him with a third DUI, a felony, and as a habitual offender, also a\nfelony.  The police also charged him marijuana possession. Applicant has not had an\n9\nalcoholic beverage since this date.10\nApplicant appeared in court on August 29, 2001. Pursuant to a plea agreement,\nhe pled guilty to both felony charges, which carried a mandatory jail time of five years\n\nGE 3, supra note 3, at 16-17; Tr. 31, 36.\n11\nTr. 24, 32-33, 36-37.\n12\nId. at 21-22, 32. \n13\nId. at 21-22, 32, 37-39.\n14\nAE A (Recommendations from employer);Tr. 48-49, 54-55.\n15\n4\neach. The court sentenced him to 10 years in jail, suspending all but 18 months. The\ncourt also suspended his drivers license for five years and placed him on three years\nprobation.11\nApplicant began his prison sentence on August 29, 2001. He stopped smoking\nmarijuana on this date. In jail, he reevaluated his life style. He enrolled in classes to\nprepare him for passing his General Education (GED) examination and attended\nalcoholics anonymous classes (AA). With sobriety, he realized how much a negative\neffect alcohol had on his life. For him, staying out of trouble from his alcohol use was\neasier than returning to jail. He decided that he preferred to move forward in his life. He\nno longer drinks and goes to parties, activities which he found easy to stop. He states\nthat he is an alcoholic and that he does not intend to drink alcohol in the future. The\nearlier alcohol programs did not work for him because he did not believe he had a\nproblem and did not want to be helped.  \n12\nApplicant served 15 \u00bd months on his sentence. He was released on good\nbehavior. Initially, after his release, he returned to work in the construction industry and\ncontinued to attend substance abuse programs. He also ran a substance abuse\nprogram at a local church for three years.  \n13\nShortly after his release from jail, his uncle told him, that if he obtained his GED\nand a certification for computer drafting, he would recommend Applicant to the company\nwhere he worked. By March 2003, Applicant had completed both. Applicant\u2019s uncle\ntestified to this same information, adding that he specifically requested the company not\nto tell anyone that Applicant was his nephew until Applicant proved himself. To his\nuncle\u2019s knowledge, Applicant has not consumed any alcohol since leaving jail.14\nSince starting his present job, Applicant has moved forward in his position. He\nnow supervises four individuals. His department has nominated him five times for\nquality associate of the year. Applicant\u2019s supervisor also testified. He described\nApplicant as a very good employee, who is dependable, reliable and trustworthy.15\nApplicant\u2019s parents, who are divorced, also testified. His mother admitted that he\nlearned to drink and party from her. As a result of his incarceration, she and his step-\nfather stopped drinking alcohol entirely. Before he went to prison, Applicant had no\npurpose in his life. He used his time in prison positively. He learned to forgive himself\n\nTr. 43-46.\n16\nTr. 58-60.\n17\nTr. 18, 33-34\n18\nId. at 21,\n19\n5\nand became a responsible young man. His mother can trust him with anything now.16\nHis father also describes him as a changed man, who did more partying than he should\nas a young man. Applicant finally realized that he was in the wrong place, a place he did\nnot want to be. Applicant does not use alcohol or drugs.17\nApplicant married six months ago and purchased a house last summer. His wife\ndoes not drink alcohol. He has new friends.  Since his arrest in April 2001, the police\n18\nhave not arrested him for any misconduct. He has had one parking ticket.  The state\nreturned his drivers license in January 2005. He now has a good driving record.19\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\n\nAt the hearing, the government withdrew allegation 1.g. because of the recent repeal of 10 U.S.C. 986. In\n20\nlight of the government\u2019s withdrawal, I need not discuss disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 31(f).\n6\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 31, the following disqualifying condition could raise a security\nconcern in this case:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.  \n20\nBetween 1995 and 2001, the police arrested Applicant three times for DUI, once\nfor public drunkenness, and twice for marijuana possession. Following his third DUI\narrest, the police also charged him as a habitual offender, a felony. He served 15 \u00bd\nmonths in prison after his third DUI conviction, a felony, and three years on probation.\nDuring this six year period of time, Applicant had numerous arrests and criminal\nconvictions related to his alcohol consumption and marijuana use. This disqualifying\ncondition applies in this case.\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n\n7\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person's life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense;\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement; and,\n(e) potentially disqualifying conditions (b) and (f) above, may not be\nmitigated unless, where meritorious circumstances exist, the Secretaries\nof the Military Departments or designee; or the Directors of Washington\nHeadquarters Services (WHS), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA),\nNational Security Agency (NSA), Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) or designee, has granted a waiver.\nSince his last DUI Arrest in April 2001, Applicant has not consumed any alcohol.\nA few months later, he stopped smoking marijuana. As a result of these decisions, he\nhas not been arrested by the police for any criminal conduct, especially conduct\nresulting from his alcohol consumption, in nearly seven years. Because he no longer\ndrinks and recognizes the negative impact of alcohol should he drink again, there is little\nlikelihood that this conduct will reoccur.  AG \u00b6 32(a) applies.\nWhile in prison, Applicant took classes to prepare for taking his GED examination\nand attend AA meetings. Since his release from prison, he obtained his GED and a\ncertificate for computer skills. He has worked at the same job for five years, comes to\nwork every day, works long hours, and is highly respected by his supervisors and co-\nworkers. He is dependable and reliable employee. He also started a substance abuse\nprogram at a local church which he ran for two years. He has successfully rehabilitated\nhis behavior and attitude towards alcohol, which ended his criminal conduct. AG \u00b6 32(d)\napplies. None of the other mitigating conditions are applicable in this case.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\n8\n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When he first started consuming\nalcohol, Applicant was a 15-year-old teenager. (See AG & 2(a)(4).) He liked to party and\ndrink, which lead to a serious drinking problem by age 18. He continued with his daily,\nexcessive drinking until age 25, despite knowing the problems his drinking was causing\nhim. (See AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a))1)-(3), (5)).  \nApplicant quit drinking following his third DUI arrest. Until this time, he denied to\nhimself that he had an alcohol problem. With this arrest, he finally realized that his\ndrinking behavior was having a detrimental effect on his life. He made a clear decision\nin April 2001 to change his attitude and behavior towards alcohol. He stopped drinking\nimmediately and continues not to drink. He acknowledges that he is an alcoholic and\nknows the negative impact future alcohol consumption will have on his life. He served\nhis prison sentence without incident. During his incarceration, he took advantage of\neducational opportunities and attend AA meetings, where he gained a much clearer\nunderstanding of alcohol and its effect on his life. Since leaving prison, he has\ncompleted his GED and attained computer skills. He has held the same work position\nfor five years and plans to continue working in this job. He recently married and\npurchased a home. He likes his present life and has no desire to return to his previous\nlife style. Given his seven-year abstinence from alcohol and nearly seven-year\nabstinence from using marijuana, and the knowledge of others in his life about his past\nconduct, the potential for coercion, exploitation, pressure or duress for his past conduct\nis unlikely. (See AG & 2(a)(6)-(9). Applicant misused alcohol as a teenage and young\nadult. His incarceration caused him to seriously reevaluate his lifestyle and look at his\nfuture. He decided to change the direction of his life and successfully did.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal  conduct. \n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nWithdrawn\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Delaney, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA) on November 8,\n2006. On January 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under foreign preference\n(Guideline C), foreign influence (Guideline B) and personal conduct (Guideline E). The\naction was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on January 29, 2008. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on April 1, 2008, and the hearing was held on April 22, 2008. Based\non a careful evaluation of all the evidence in the record, Applicant\u2019s eligibility for security\nclearance is denied. \nJune 24, 2008\n\n2\nAt the hearing, the government submitted four exhibits (GE). The fourth exhibit\n(administrative notice exhibit) contains facts from United States Government (State\nDepartment) agency publications that describe the government of Nigeria, its human\nrights record, and various problems U.S. citizens face in traveling to the country.\nApplicant testified and submitted one exhibit (AE A) relating to a bank account he has in\nNigeria. Following the hearing, Applicant submitted diversity visa entry forms for four of\nhis relatives. In By Memorandum dated April 25, 2008, Department Counsel indicated\nhe had no objection to the documents (diversity visa entry forms) being admitted in\nevidence. Accordingly, AE C is admitted into evidence, and is now a part of the record.\nThe record in this case closed on April 25, 2008. DOHA received the transcript on May\n1, 2008. \nProcedural Ruling\nAttached to Applicant\u2019s answer are five documents that are photocopies of his\nNigerian passport and United States (U.S.) passport. Those documents are relabeled\nAE B, and have been sua sponte entered in the record.  \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the three allegations under the foreign preference guideline\nwith explanations. He admitted the seven allegations under the foreign influence\nguideline, and the one allegation under the personal conduct guideline with\nexplanations. The primary point of his answer to the SOR is that he did not intend to\ndeceive the government about his Nigerian passport under the foreign preference\nguideline or the personal conduct guideline. \nApplicant is 37 years old and has been employed as a systems administrator by\na defense contractor since January 1999. He seeks a secret security clearance. \nApplicant was born in Nigeria in April 1971. He came to the United States in\n1988. He met his wife (a Nigerian by birth) in 1992, and married her in June 1995. His\nwife gave birth to their first child in 1995. Applicant entered the U.S. Air Force Reserves\nin 1997. In May 2002, Applicant became a U.S. citizen. His wife was naturalized in July\n2002. Applicant was honorably discharged from the U.S. Air Force on August 26, 2005. \nApplicant\u2019s U.S. education began in June 1996 at a local university where he\nstarted his undergraduate study for a Bachelor of Science. He was awarded the degree\nin June 2001. He also enrolled in graduate studies at the same school, and hopes to\nreceive his Masters of Science degree in Computer Technology in December 2008. In\nFebruary 2002, Applicant completed a three-month course in systems administration.\nHe completed a one-month course for a systems administrator II position in August\n2002.\n\n \u201cMy statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, and correct to the best of my\n1\nknowledge and belief and are made in good faith. I understand that a knowing and willful false statement on\nthis form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both. (See section 1001 of title 18, United States Code).\u201d\n3\nForeign Preference\nApplicant indicated in his answer to the SOR that he does not practice dual\ncitizenship. (SOR 1.a.) He also indicated his allegiance is to the U.S. only. The record\nreflects that after being naturalized as a U.S. citizen in May 2002, and after obtaining his\nU.S passport in July 2002, Applicant renewed his Nigerian passport in June 2004 (Tr.\n106), and used the passport in December 2004. (AE C, Tr. 86)\nOn November 8, 2006, Applicant certified  through his signature on the last page\n1\nof a security clearance application (GE 1, SCA) that the entries on the form were\ntruthful. On page 33 of the exhibit, he indicated that he had a Nigerian passport that was\nissued to him in August 1988, with an estimated expiration date of June 2004. (SOR\n1.b.) Applicant admitted the SOR allegation, but claimed his words identifying the\nexpiration of the Nigerian passport resulted from an oversight when he was completing\nthe SCA, and even though he had 30 days to complete the security form. (Tr. 131) He\nthen claimed he actually lost the passport, and reported the loss twice to the Nigerian\nEmbassy in October 2006. They told him to file a police report. He provided no\ndocumentation of his contact with the Embassy or a police report. The correct expiration\ndate appearing in a xerox copy of the passport is June 2009. (AE B) Applicant admitted\nunder SOR 1.c. that he used his Nigerian passport for travel to Nigeria from December\n2004 to January 2005, because he did not know of the prohibition against using a\nforeign passport after receiving U.S. citizenship. \nForeign Influence\nApplicant\u2019s mother passed away in July 1977 and his father in July 2000.\nApplicant\u2019s stepmother (SOR 2.a.) is 44 years old (GE 1), and a resident citizen of\nNigeria. Once a year, he relays a message to her through a friend. He last saw her\nduring his trip in December 2004 for his friend\u2019s wedding. Applicant is not obligated to\nprovide for her in any way. None of Applicant\u2019s relatives know he is applying for a\nsecurity clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s siblings and half-siblings are resident citizens of Nigeria. The\nabundant number of siblings is due to his father having three wives. (Tr. 46) Applicant\nhas a 50-year-old sister who was born in Nigeria and still lives there. She is a farmer.\nHe last saw her during his visit in December 2007. Applicant has a second sister who\nwas born and lives in Nigeria. She is a farmer. (Tr. 43-44) The record does not reveal\nher age. Applicant saw her during his visit in December 2007. \nApplicant has a brother who is a resident citizen of Nigeria, and who works for an\noil company. Though Applicant could not recall his age (Tr. 45), he told the investigator\nin GE 2 his brother was 45 years old, and was a half-brother. In conversations with this\n\n In GE 2, Applicant indicated she was a trader before retiring. \n2\n4\nbrother or half-brother (employee of the oil company) two or three times a year, they talk\nabout family matters. \nAnother half-brother is a truck driver who is currently unemployed. (Tr. 46) A half-\nsister that Applicant believes is 44 years old, is a resident citizen of Nigeria. She is\nemployed as a farmer. Applicant communicates with her through her son (Applicant\u2019s\nnephew). The nephew is 25 years old, and Applicant is sponsoring him for immigration.\n(AE C) Another half-brother who was born and resides in Nigeria, is a carpenter, but\nApplicant is unsure about his age. \nApplicant identified another sister who is 42 years old, and a resident citizen of\nNigeria. She is a farmer. Applicant speaks to her through his 44-year-old half sister\nreferred to in the previous paragraph. Another brother was born in Nigeria, and still\nresides there. He is 35 years old. He is a trader in shoes and material used in the\nassembly of clothes. (Tr. 53) Applicant sponsored him through the lottery visa. (AE C)\nApplicant has two other sisters who are resident citizens of Nigeria. According to\nApplicant, one may be 20 years old and a nurse (Tr. 55). AE C reflects she is 32.\nApplicant did not know the age of the other sister who may be a secretary in a local\ngovernment in Nigeria. \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law (SOR 2.c.) was born in Nigeria and still lives there. She\nis 70 years old, and Applicant testified she is employed as a farmer,  though she is\n2\nfarming less due to her age. (Tr. 57) She came to the U.S. in 1999, but returned to\nNigeria. Her biological children provide for her, and she has never been dependent on\nApplicant. He speaks to her about three times a year, and last saw her in December\n2004. \nApplicant\u2019s siblings-in-law are citizens and residents of Nigeria. Applicant\u2019s sister-\nin-law is a trader. Applicant speaks to her twice a year, and last saw her in December\n2004. The sister-in-law\u2019s daughter, a computer operator and a resident citizen of\nNigeria, speaks to Applicant three times a year. She and his other in-laws are not aware\nhe is applying for a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s two brother-in-laws, one a carpenter\nand one a bricklayer, speak about three times a year with Applicant. Applicant is\nsponsoring the carpenter (35 years old) for immigration. (AE C) He last saw the\nbricklayer and the carpenter in December 2004. \nApplicant has a step brother, but does not know much about him. He estimated\nthe sibling was 20 years old and some kind of mechanic. (Tr. 88) Applicant\u2019s step sister\nis a petty trader, who trades out of a booth. Applicant does not know anything about his\nother step sister. (Tr. 90)\n\n Though the friend is not listed in the SOR, Applicant\u2019s level of contact with this person appears to be closer\n3\nthan the contact he has with his family members.\n Applicant has lived in this house since December 2000. \n4\n5\nThough he has no contacts with his aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews, and\nnieces, Applicant has a friend  he equates to a brother. Applicant has known his friend\n3\nsince childhood and attended his wedding in December 2004. Applicant talks to the\nfriend about five times or more a year. (Tr. 96) The friend is about 37 years old, and\nemployed as an agriculture adviser to the local government. \nApplicant acknowledged he opened a bank account (SOR 2.e.) in Nigeria in 2002\nthat he believes may be closed due to inactivity. He used the bank account to exchange\ndollars for the local currency. He tried to get a friend to close out the account while in\nthe country, but the bank officials want Applicant to appear in person. Applicant wrote\nthe bank to have the account closed. (AE A)\nApplicant admitted in allegation 2.f. of the SOR that he helped build a house in\nNigeria by contributing about $5,000.00. Though the house is referred to as a family\nhouse, the $5,000.00 was actually used to finance the construction of the second\nhouse. The house gives Applicant and his wife a place to live when they visit Nigeria.\nApplicant has no interest in either house. Only his younger brothers have inheritance\nrights in the first house. The second house has no monetary value. Applicant\u2019s net\nworth in the U.S., including his house,  investments, and insurance is about $400.000.\n4\nApplicant traveled to Nigeria in 1996, 2000, 2002, 2003, and December 2004.\nThe trips were to bury family members or for pleasure purposes. Applicant took an\nadditional unlisted trip in December 2007 for his uncle\u2019s funeral. On this trip, he claims\nhe used both his U.S. and Nigerian passport. \nAE C indicates a Diversity Visa Lottery Entry Form was entered for Applicant\u2019s\nbrother, sister, and nephew for 2005, 2006, and 2007. A Lottery Visa was also filed for\nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law for 2005 and 2006.\nPersonal Conduct\nIn response to SOR 3.a., Applicant admitted he traveled to Nigeria on his\nNigerian passport even though he indicated in his November 2006 SCA (GE 1) that he\nhad a Nigerian passport issued in 1988 with an estimated expiration date of June 2004,\nand that he had no intention of renewing the passport. As he indicated in his response\nto SOR 1.b., Considering all the evidence relevant to SOR 3.a., Applicant has not\nprovided a credible explanation as to why he would indicate in his security form that his\nNigerian passport expired in June 2004, when he actually renewed the passport in June\n2004. The fact he did not know he was disallowed from carrying two passports is not\nrelevant to the false statements he entered on the security form in November 2006. I\nfind Applicant intentionally provided false information in his November 2006 SCA by\n\n6\nstating (1) his Nigerian passport expired in 2004, and (2) that he had no intention of\nrenewing his passport. \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant served six years in the U.S. Air Force Reserves as an Airman. He\nreceived an honorable discharged on August 26, 2005. Applicant stresses that his\nallegiance is only to the U.S. Applicant does not believe he could be blackmailed by any\nof his family members. Applicant is a registered political party member. He volunteers at\nthe public library. His wife participates in the church food bank program that provides\nfood to the underprivileged. Applicant provided no evidence describing his employment\nperformance. \nAdministrative Notice\nI have taken administrative notice GE 4 that consists of the following government\ndocuments:\nU.S. Department of State, Background Note: Nigeria, dated February 2008;\nU.S. Department of State, Consular Information Sheet, Nigeria, dated April 16,\n2007;\nU.S. Department of State, Travel Warning: Nigeria, dated October 30, 2007\nU.S. Department of State, Nigeria: Country Reports of Human Rights Practices-\n2006, dated March 6, 2007; and,\nCongressional Research Service, CRS Report for Congress, Nigeria: Current\nIssues, dated April 12, 2007 (Congressional Research Service Report). \nNigeria, since gaining its independence in 1960, has been controlled more by\nmilitary rulers than democratically elected civilian rulers. Even though the government\nreturned to civilian rule in 1999, the government continues to have a poor human rights\nrecord. The lack of law and order in various areas of the country results in internal,\nperiodic armed conflicts between religious, political and ethnic factions, as well as\ncrimes committed against Western travelers to the country, particularly in the oil\nproducing Niger Delta region. Recognizing the troubling problems in the Delta region,\nthe current president, elected in May 2007, has pledged to restore peace and security to\nthe region, while instilling long-term, electoral reform throughout the country. President\nBush considers Nigeria an important partner in the war on terror. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\n\n7\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\n+concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\na+bout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nForeign Preference (FP)\nWhen an individual acts in a way that indicates a preference for a foreign country\nover the U.S., then he or she may be disposed to provide information or make decisions\nharmful to the U.S. \nForeign Influence (FI)\nThe security issues connected to foreign influence are familial ties, contacts,\nand/or proprietary/financial interests that could be used to generate a heightened risk of\n\n8\nforcing an applicant into  a position of having to choose between the foreign entity and\nthe U.S. \nPersonal Conduct (PC)\nThe focus of this guideline is questionable judgment, dishonesty or failure to\nfollow rules.\nAnalysis\nForeign Preference (FP)\n9. The Concern. \u201cWhen a person demonstrates by his actions that he prefers a foreign\ncountry over the U.S., then he may be prone to provide information or make decisions\nthat are harmful the U.S.\u201d \nWhen Applicant used his Nigerian passport after receiving his U.S. citizenship in\nMay 2002, he was exercising dual citizenship. FP DC 10.a.(1) (exercise of any right,\nprivilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the\nforeign citizenship of a family member - possession of a current passport) applies.\nPossession, renewal and/or use of the foreign passport after being naturalized as a U.S.\ncitizen constitutes the exercise of a privilege of his Nigerian citizenship that he was not\nentitled to. Though Applicant claimed his estimation of the expiration of his Nigerian\npassport was unintentionally incorrect, his claim is belied by his testimony admitting he\nactually renewed the passport in June 2004. Though he claimed he called the Nigerian\nEmbassy in October 2006 to report he had lost his Nigerian passport, the lack of\ndocumentation makes his claim unpersuasive.\nApplicant\u2019s dual citizenship is based on more than his birth in a foreign country.\nHence, FP MC 11.a. (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a\nforeign country) is not applicable. Though Applicant has provided statements\nconcerning his willingness to renounce his Nigerian citizenship, there has been no\naction to support these statements. The purported contact with the Nigerian Embassy is\nnot substantiated. \nFP MC 11.e. (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant\nauthority, or otherwise invalidated) indicates in unequivocal language that if the person\nwants to demonstrate his intent to relinquish his foreign citizenship, then he must take\naction set forth in the mitigating condition. Applicant has not taken the appropriate\naction under FP MC 11.e. to invalidate his lost Nigerian passport. I find against\nApplicant under the FP guideline. \nForeign Influence\n6. The Concern. \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign interests, may be manipulated or induced to\n\n9\nhelp a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S.\ninterests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication\nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which\nthe foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain\nprotected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d\nThe mere possession of family ties in foreign country is not automatically\ndisqualifying under the foreign influence guideline. When assessing the family ties, it is\nimportant to weigh the totality of these ties in a foreign country, rather than trying to\nweigh them in isolation. Considering the record as a whole, the government has\nestablished its case under the FI guideline. FI disqualifying condition (DC) 7.a. (contact\nwith a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other\nperson who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion)\napplies. Applicant\u2019s family ties to his stepmother, his siblings and half-siblings, his\nmother-in-law, his siblings-in-law, and his lifelong friend, who are resident citizens of\nNigeria, require him to present evidence in mitigation to meet his burden of persuasion\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for him.\nI have concluded that FI DC 7.e. (a substantial business, financial, or property\ninterest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business,\nwhich could subject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or\nexploitation) does not apply. Given the Applicant\u2019s net worth of his assets in the U.S. of\napproximately $400,00.00, including his home, the $5,000.00 Applicant contributed to\nbuild a place to stay in Nigeria is not a \u201csubstantial\u201d financial interest that could expose\nApplicant to a heightened risk of foreign influence. \nThree of the six mitigating conditions (MC) under the FI guideline may apply to\nthe facts and circumstances of this case: \nFC MC 8.a. (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the position or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will\nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.); \nFI MC 8.b. (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is minimal, or the individual has such deep and long lasting\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected\nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest);\n\n10\n FI MC 8.c. (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual\nand infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for\nforeign influence or exploitation).\nAlmost all of Applicant\u2019s family members are farmers or traders. Only one half-\nsister works as a secretary for a local government entity. Though employed by a local\ngovernment within the country of Nigeria, there is no evidence she is an agent of the\nNigerian government. There is no indication that any of his relatives are agents of the\nNigerian government. However, Applicant\u2019s six trips to Nigeria since 1996, with two trips\nto attend weddings, demonstrates that he is close to at least some of his family\nmembers. Given the persistent law and order problems in various parts of the country,\nthere is a heightened risk, even discounting his ties to his lifelong friend, that pressure\nor coercion could be applied to and through Applicant\u2019s family members to Applicant,\nthereby putting him in a position of having to choose between the interests of the foreign\nfamily member and the interests of the U.S. FI MC 8.a. is inapplicable. \nApplicant has indicated that his sense of loyalty to his family members in Nigeria\nis so minimal, that he can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. The\nDOHA Appeal Board has held that a person\u2019s statements of how he would act or react\nto a potential future event cannot be given much weight. See, ISCR Case No. 02-26826\n(November 12, 2003). The lack of detailed evidence concerning most of Applicant\u2019s\nfamily members who are resident citizens of Nigeria raises lingering questions about the\nstrength of Applicant\u2019s resolve to resist efforts at foreign influence. Notwithstanding his\nsix-year service in the Air Force as an Airman, Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence is\ninsufficient to conclude that he can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the\nU.S. \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his family members, when viewed in isolation, are\nrelatively infrequent. To contact several of his family members, he sends a message\nthrough another family member. The DOHA Appeal Board has indicated it is important\nto consider the totality of an applicant\u2019s family contacts in a foreign country, not just\neach family contact considered in isolation. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd.\nSep. 22, 2003) FI MC 8.c. does not apply as Applicant\u2019s contacts with his family\nmembers, when viewed in their totality, are not casual nor infrequent. The FI guideline is\nfound against Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n15. The Concern. \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance\nprocess.\u201d \n\n11\nIn November 2006, Applicant was provided 30 days to fill out his SCA (GE 1).\nInstead of stating on page 33 of the SCA that he renewed his Nigerian passport in June\n2004 and used the passport in December 2004, he provided false information that his\npassport had instead expired in June 2004, and that he had no intention of renewing the\npassport. Applicant\u2019s intentional falsification of material information concerning his\nNigerian passport falls within the scope of PC DC 16.a. (deliberate omission or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire used to\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness). \nOnce a case is made under the disqualifying conditions of the PC guideline, the\nburden shifts to Applicant to prove under the mitigating conditions that he warrants a\nsecurity clearance. PC MC 17.a. (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to\ncorrect the omission, concealment or falsification before being confronted with the facts)\ndoes not apply as Applicant continues to deny he falsified his SCA in November 2006.\nPC MC 17.b. is not relevant based on Applicant\u2019s age and six-year employment in the\nU.S. Air Force Reserves. PC MC 17.c. (the offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply because less than two\nyears have passed, and Applicant continues to deny he falsified the security form. PC\nMC 17.d. (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to\nchange the behavior or taken positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or\nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such\nbehavior is unlikely to recur) is inapplicable for the same reasons. Applicant persists in\nclaiming an oversight when the surrounding circumstances show an intentional\nfalsification. Applicant has not presented sufficient, mitigating evidence to negate his\nintentional falsification of the SCA in November 2006. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nMy finding against Applicant under the FP, FI, and PC guidelines must still be\nevaluated in the context of nine variables known as the whole person concept. In\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the administrative judge should\nconsider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3)\nthe frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which the participation was voluntary; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Though Applicant has made\nstatements about renunciation of his Nigerian passport, he has not taken the action\nnecessary under the FP guideline. Applicant has provided insufficient evidence under\nthe FI guideline to lessen the security concerns related to his foreign family connections.\nFinally, Applicant\u2019s ongoing refusal to admit he falsified a critical document used by the\ngovernment to determine security suitability precludes a finding in his favor under the\nPC guideline. \n\n12\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Foreign Preference, Guideline C):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Foreign Influence, Guideline B): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by 3 Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant is married and has two stepdaughters (both grown). He has 13 years experience as a police officer before leaving to establish his own consulting business in 2005. Applicant spent the better part of three years in Iraq (between 2005 and 2008) working with the U.S. Army in training Iraqi police (see exs. 9 and B; R.T., at 90). In April 2001, Applicant in the company of his wife (W) contacted a car dealership about purchasing or leasing a new Mitsubishi vehicle (compare ex 2 with ex. R.T., at 54, 64). He completed paperwork with the dealership, and turned in his wife\u2019s used Mitsubishi as a trade-in (crediting him with about $7,000.00 towards purchase of the new Mitsubishi vehicle, and collateral for his test driving a new 2001 Mitsubishi Montero sports utility vehicle (see ex. 2; R.T., at 58-59,64-65). By his own account in his electronic questionnaire for investigations processing (e-qip) (see ex. 10) and in his certified 2007 OPM interview, he agreed on terms of purchase and/or lease with a purchase option of a 2001 Mitsubishi Montero with the dealer\u2019s salesman (see exs. 1 and 2, R.T., at 65). Applicant acknowledged, too, that he accepted finance terms with the dealer",

A hearing was held on April 28, 2008, for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny,\nor revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted\nof 10 exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and two exhibits.  The transcript\nJuly 28, 2008\n\n2\n(R.T.) was received on May 7, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified information is granted.\nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Appellant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with possible documentation of indemnity with his insurance company covering\nthe reported balance on his vehicle repossession.  For good cause shown, Applicant\nwas granted 10 days to supplement the record.  Within the time permitted, Applicant\nsupplemented the record with an explanatory cover letter and two letters from his\ninsurance agent and carrier.  Department Counsel did not object to the submissions but\nunderscored Applicant\u2019s changed perceptions about the intended nature of his\narrangement with the dealer he negotiated with over a Mitsubishi sports vehicle (i.e.,\nfrom his emphasis on a purchase to his hearing perceptions of a lease). \nDepartment Counsel suggests different legal ramifications with a lease than with\na purchase: Specifically in a lease situation, Applicant would not be expected to ow\nanything additional if the damaged vehicle were properly insured (see Department\nCounsel\u2019s memorandum re: Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions). Both Applicant\u2019s\npost-hearing exhibits and Department counsel\u2019s suggestions were admitted and\nconsidered.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated one delinquent debt\nin the amount of $19,199.00.  This debt represents a deficiency balance on a\nrepossessed vehicle. \nFor his answer, Applicant denied the deficiency debt.  He claimed he never\nsigned any vehicle purchase papers and was permitted to drive the car off the lot to test\ndrive for a three-day period.  He claimed that the car was in an accident (no fault of his)\nand was in and out of the shop for repairs for over a year before he told the seller he\nwished to return the car.  He claimed he continued to make payments on the car during\nthe year it was in repairs at the urging of his insurance company.  He claimed that the\nseller wanted $14,000.00 to put him in a replacement vehicle, which he refused and\ndemanded unsuccessfully to see original purchase papers the dealer claimed he and\nhis wife signed.  Applicant claimed that he has tried over the past few years to convince\nthe dealer that the purchase papers they eventually furnished him contained forgeries of\nhe and his wife\u2019s signatures.  And he claimed that he has submitted handwriting\nsamples, depositions and requests to remove the alleged deficiency from his credit\nreport, but to no avail. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 59-year-old law-enforcement professional  for a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\n\n3\nApplicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material\nfindings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant is married and has two stepdaughters (both grown).  He has 13 years\nexperience as a police officer before leaving to establish his own consulting business in\n2005.  Applicant spent the better part of three years in Iraq (between 2005 and 2008)\nworking with the U.S. Army in training Iraqi police (see exs. 9 and B; R.T., at 90).\nIn April 2001, Applicant in the company of his wife (W) contacted a car dealership\nabout purchasing or leasing a new Mitsubishi vehicle (compare ex 2 with ex. R.T., at 54,\n64).  He completed paperwork with the dealership, and turned in his wife\u2019s used\nMitsubishi as a trade-in (crediting him with about $7,000.00 towards purchase of the\nnew  Mitsubishi vehicle, and collateral for his test driving a new 2001 Mitsubishi Montero\nsports utility vehicle (see ex. 2; R.T., at 58-59,64-65). By his own account in his\nelectronic questionnaire for investigations processing (e-qip) (see ex. 10) and in his\ncertified 2007 OPM interview, he agreed on terms of purchase and/or lease with a\npurchase option of a 2001 Mitsubishi Montero with the dealer\u2019s salesman (see exs. 1\nand 2, R.T., at 65).\nApplicant acknowledged, too, that he accepted finance terms with the dealer\u2019s\nfinance company and initiated monthly payments of $461.00 a month to the finance\ncompany (ex. 2).  While Applicant himself does not admit to signing required \u201cproper\ndocumentation\u201d for the vehicle (R.T., at 64-65), his wife (W) certified to Applicant\u2019s\npurchasing a new 2001 Mitsubishi from the same dealer in an affidavit she executed in\nApril 2006 for an intended police report (see ex. 9). \nBoth W and Applicant claim that someone forged their names to sales\ndocuments: a credit application in W\u2019s case (see exs. 8 through 10) and a sales contract\nunder date of April 20, 2001 with Applicant (see exs. 2 and 7).  In disclaiming his signing\nthe referenced sales contract in exhibit 7, or other proper documentation (his\ncharacterization), he doesn\u2019t define the contract provided him by the dealer\u2019s agents or\nattempt to explain its contents.  \nWhatever sales terms Applicant and the dealer\u2019s salesman agreed to in April\n2001, it is most likely they committed their understanding of Applicant\u2019s purchase of the\nvehicle to some kind of written understanding, no matter how imperfect the document\nmight have been. Considering that Applicant was turning his wife\u2019s car over to the\ndealership as an intended trade-in, it is conceivable that the salesman applicant dealt\nwith considered the trade-in to be adequate collateral for release of the vehicle.  Without\ndocumentation of the parties\u2019 understanding, this can only be considered a possibility.\nThe purchase or lease document itself that the parties signed might have been brief and\nlacking in all of the fine print, but sufficient to consummate a vehicle purchase and/or\nlease/purchase arrangement.  Together with the trade-in collateral that Applicant and W\nleft with the dealership, the documentation might well have been legally sufficient to\njustify the dealer\u2019s permitting Applicant and his wife to drive the car off the lot for a\nthree-day test drive (a practice enforced by most states).\n\n4\nApparently satisfied with the documentation Applicant provided, the dealer\u2019s\nsalesman then permitted Applicant to drive the vehicle off the lot and return it in three\ndays time if he did not like it (R.T., at 65-66).  Applicant, in turn, drove the Mitsubishi\nSUV off the lot with an insurance binder on the car from his own insurance company\n(compare Answer with ex.2). \nOnce away from the dealer\u2019s lot, Applicant drove the Mitsubishi vehicle placed in\nhis custody well outside the geographical boundaries of his community.  While test\ndriving the vehicle in an area outside his immediate community, he was involved in an\naccident, which was not his fault (see. exs. 2 and D).  After the incident, Applicant\npromptly called his insurance company to report the accident and make a claim on the\noffender\u2019s insurance policy (see ex. D; R.T., at 72-73).  Contemporaneously, he called\nthe dealership to pick up the car and take it to their body shop for repairs (see ex. 2:\nR.T., at 72-75).  At all times, Applicant dealt with his insurance company, who, in turn,\ninterfaced with the offender\u2019s responsible carrier (R.T., at 73).  His account of this chain\nof events is corroborated by his insurance carrier (see exs. C and D).  \nOver the course of the ensuing year, the Mitsubishi SUV entrusted to Applicant\nwas in and out of the seller\u2019s designated body and repair shops (R.T., at 61-62, 79-80).\nWhile in for repairs, Applicant was furnished a loaner car by the repair shop (R.T., at 61-\n62).  Applicant and his carrier deferred to the seller to take responsibility for the quality of\nthe work on the damaged vehicle (R.T., at 82).  Presumably, the seller had opportunities\nto assess the condition of the car and make at least preliminary assessments about safe\nand effective restoration of the vehicle to its pre-accident condition. The seller\u2019s\napprovals of the vehicle\u2019s restoration to top condition are implicit in its joint endorsement\n(with Applicant) of the $12,000.00 check from the offender\u2019s insurance company in full\nsettlement of their joint and several damage claims from the offender\u2019s insurance\ncompany (see exs. C and D; R.T., at 74-92). \nBased on his completed purchasing and financing papers (in whatever document\nform they were prepared), Applicant continued to make $461.00 monthly car payments\nto the seller through August 2002, or thereabouts (see ex. 2; R.T., at 61).  Without the\nensuing April 2001 credit application and formal sales contract that Applicant and W\nclaim were forged, it is not clear just what specific documentation the dealer and its\nfinancing arm were relying on, but they did continue to accept Applicant\u2019s monthly\npayments on the vehicle for over a year (i.e., April 2001 to August 2002).  \nFrustrated with seemingly endless repairs (which exceeded $12,000.00 in\noutlays), Applicant tired of retaining the vehicle and asked the dealer around August\n2002 to trade in the Mitsubishi for a new vehicle (R.T., at 33, 92-93).  The dealer\n(Applicant assures), in turn, offered to place Applicant in a new vehicle for an additional\n$14,000.00 down payment (see ex. 1; R.T., at 28, 33, 63, 85-88).  When Applicant asked\nthe dealer for completed sales documents covering his supposed purchase of the\nvehicle, the dealer advised that it could not find the sale documents (see ex. 2; R.T., at\n33-34).  Applicant refused the dealer\u2019s offer and requested the dealer to voluntarily\n\n5\nrepossess the vehicle (apparently in Applicant\u2019s possession at the time) (see ex. 2).  The\ndealer complied with Applicant\u2019s request.\nAt the time he turned the entrusted Mitsubishi SUV over to the seller, he claims\nhis outstanding balance on the vehicle was $18,072.00 (see ex. 2).  His claim is not\nchallenged and is a plausible amount under all of the circumstances.  The vehicle at\nissue was a new and small 2001 Mitsubishi SUV that is carried as a joint purchase in\nApplicant\u2019s February 2007 credit report (ex. 4) with a listed purchase price of $31,431.00.\nWithout more to go on, this price would appear to represent the sticker price of the\nvehicle without regard to any trade-in credits.  Both of his recent credit reports (exs. 3\nand 4) report a $19,199.00 balance on an account closed and transferred.  This reported\nsum (inclusive of some added interest) would appear to be a net sum that credits\nApplicant for his trade-in and year\u2019s payments.  What this reported deficiency does not\nappear to cover is a credit for the proceeds of the vehicle\u2019s resale, release, or public\nauction sale. \nBy taking responsibility for the repair of the Mitsubishi SUV vehicle at Applicant\u2019s\nrequest and joining in the settlement of Applicant\u2019s insurance claims with the offender\u2019s\ncarrier, the seller implicitly certified to restoration of the vehicle to its original condition.\nAs an almost new car in top condition (seller\u2019s certification in endorsement of insurance\ncheck), it could be expected to bring at least 75 per cent  of its new sticker price.  If this\nwere the case, Applicant could well be a net creditor of the seller and its collection agent,\nnot a debtor. \nShortly after declining Applicant\u2019s request for copies of the sales documents\ncovering his Mitsubishi purchase/lease, the dealer located the sale documents and faxed\nthem to Applicant (ex. 2; R.T., at 64).  When Applicant examined the furnished sales\ndocuments, he claimed the signatures of himself and W had been forged.  Because he\ndid not specify which documents were forged, his forgery claims could not be\nimmediately pinned down (R.T., at 34, 57-58).  Once Applicant and his engaged attorney\nadvised the seller of their impressions, the seller suggested they file a police report.\nAdditionally, the seller asked for handwriting samples and an affidavit (R.T., at 34-35).\nApplicant complied with the dealer\u2019s affidavit request at the time, but did not provide any\nhandwriting samples\nOnce Applicant and W were alerted that the Mitsubishi dealer and its collection\nagency had referred a deficiency claim on Applicant\u2019s returned vehicle to credit reporting\nagencies, they engaged attorneys to investigate their actions. Their engaged attorneys\nwho conducted their own investigation of the car dealer\u2019s providing negative information\nto credit reporting agencies confirmed their findings that an employee of the dealership\naffixed  the names of Applicant and W to a credit application and sales contract in April\n2001 without their approvals (compare exs. 2, 7 through 10 and A).\nActing on his attorneys\u2019s advice, Applicant and W prepared affidavits in 2006 for\nprospective filing of a malfeasance report with the local police department (see exs. 7\nthrough 9).  The police detective who took Applicant\u2019s inquiries in 2006 about filing a\n\n6\nmalfeasance complaint on the Mitsubishi dealership advised him that due to the\nremoteness of time and the difficulty in identifying the offending party the police would\nnot pursue an investigation and would not require handwriting samples (see ex. 9).\nConsequently, neither Applicant, W nor their attorneys proceeded with the filing of a\npolice report covering the incident and furnishing handwriting samples.  Over the ensuing\nyears, \nApplicant\u2019s \nattorneys \nand \nthe \nseller\u2019s \ncollection \nagents \nexchanged\ncorrespondence and proofs addressing the dispute (see exs. 7 through 10 and A; R.T.,\nat 36).\nBecause no sales documentation was made available by either party, it is difficult\nto ascertain what precise business arrangements Applicant made with the car dealer in\nApril 2001.  Applicant does provide potentially conflicting accounts of his arrangement.\nIn his e-qip and OPM interview summary he described the arrangement as a purchase.\nAt hearing, though, he offered a little bit different perception: characterizing his\nimpressions as a contemplated lease arrangement. \nAuto leases, like straight purchases, typically lock in monthly payments over the\nlife of the agreed lease and can result in repossessions for non-payment not unlike\nvehicle purchases. Just as repossession of a leased vehicle before the expiration of the\nlease term does not release the lessee from his remaining lease obligations under the\nterms of his lease, a lessor\u2019s repossession of the vehicle for non-payment or other lease\ndefault still imposes responsibility on the lessor to mitigate its potential losses by\ncrediting the lessee with the proceeds of sale of the vehicle on his remaining lease\nobligations.  In a lease/purchase arrangement, the lessee is typically offered the choice\nof keeping the vehicle to term or buying off the remaining time on the lease with a\nnegotiated purchase of the vehicle based on the vehicle\u2019s assessed blue book value at\nthe time of conversion.  Where payment suspensions are contemplated by the\nconsumer, it probably does not make a great deal of difference for consequential\npurposes whether the legal transaction is characterized as a purchase or a lease.  \nWith the legal ramifications between a lease and purchase duly noted, several\npieces of evidence do point to Applicant\u2019s completing a purchase of the vehicle.  His\nacknowledgments of a purchase in his e-qip and OPM interview are quite probative (see\nexs. 1 and 2).  His obtaining an insurance binder on the vehicle with his own insurance\ncompany, and his taking possession of the vehicle (R.T., at 31) are certainly consistent\nwith ownership or lease of the vehicle.  At the very least, Applicant\u2019s actions created  a\nbailment, by which Applicant assumed legal responsibilities for the care of the car while\nhe had custody of the vehicle.  Arranged car payments of $461.00 a month with the\ndealer\u2019s financing agency before he assumed possession of the car are also consistent\nwith an ownership transfer or lease, even if reversible within the time specified in the\ncontract and state law.  \nApplicant\u2019s turning over his old vehicle in trade (R.T., at 58-59) is consistent, too,\nwith a purchase, or perhaps a lease.  W\u2019s acknowledging Applicant\u2019s signing purchase\npapers at the dealership while denying any responsibility of her own provides further\nevidence of Applicant\u2019s purchase of the vehicle. So, too, Applicant\u2019s continued car\n\n7\npayments for over a year on the SUV vehicle and his negotiated settlement with the\noffender\u2019s insurance carrier over repairs and any injuries (Applicant claims limits in the\noffender\u2019s insurance policy) are demonstrative, too, of a purchase or lease of the vehicle\nin issue.\nWhat remains unclear is what Applicant and W allegedly signed in April 2001.\nApplicant swears in his affidavit that he never signed a sales contract in April 2001 that\ncontains his signature (see ex 7; R.T., at 60-62); while W swears she never signed a\ncredit application or sales agreement that bears her signature.  Both sworn affidavit\naccounts are reconcilable with Applicant\u2019s claims.  Missing, though, are copies of the\ndisputed documents themselves. Neither party has provided copies of sale\ndocumentation of any kind (to include purchase memoranda agreements, with or without\nall of the fine print, pre-test drive financial arrangements, agreements of terms and\nconditions of release of the subject vehicle to Applicant, and any post-car release credit\napplications, forged or otherwise).  Whether any of the underlying documentation is\ncurrently available is unknown.\n The evidence is strong, though, that Applicant consummated a financed\npurchase of the Mitsubishi SUV he drove off with in April 2001.  In addition to his\ncontinuing to make payments on the vehicle, he completed a settlement agreement with\nthe offender\u2019s insurance carrier to cover the car\u2019s repairs.  If Applicant had neither\npurchased nor leased the vehicle, a reasonable case can be made that the seller and its\ncarrier would have taken the lead in working out third-party compensatory arrangements\nwith the offender\u2019s insurance carrier, and not required Applicant\u2019s co-signature. As it\nwas, it appears that Applicant and his carrier took the lead in working with the offender\u2019s\ncarrier, while collectively deferring to the seller for the supervising of repairs.   \nOther events point, too, to the consummation of some kind of Applicant purchase\nor lease of the vehicle at issue.  Applicant is of record in confirming that the vehicle he\nturned in before taking custody of the Mitsubishi in April 2001 was worth approximately\n$7,000.00 (R.T., at 59).  If he did sign over title to his turned in vehicle, realistically he\nshould have been entitled to a prompt return of the vehicle when he voluntarily turned\nthe SUV back to the seller.  His failure to demand return of his trade-in makes sense only\nif he had completed transfer papers before taking possession of the Mitsubishi SUV. \nApplicant\u2019s taking the vehicle on a three-day family trip outside of his immediate\ncommunity is difficult, too, to reconcile with an agreed test-drive of the vehicle without\nany assumed purchase or lease obligation.  For a simple test drive arrangement, the\nseller\u2019s carrier would likely have born responsibility for any accidental damage.  That\nApplicant felt the need to engage his own insurance carrier is more consistent with an\nassumed purchase or lease of the vehicle.  Not only is there no sales agreement (forged\nor not) to assess the respective obligations of the parties under the terms of the\ndocument, but Applicant never filed any contemporaneous police report (see ex. 2).\nBesides a lack of any paper record of Applicant\u2019s sales dispute over the Mitsubishi\nvehicle he is billed for, there is no documented evidence of any legal action initiated by\n\n8\nApplicant.  All that is compiled in the record are credit reports reflecting a deficiency\nbalance, written accounts from W, Applicant\u2019s interview summary and answer, and\nexchanged letters between the seller\u2019s collection agent and Applicant\u2019s attorney\ndocumenting a dispute and threatened litigation over the vehicle\u2019s purchase and the\nbalance owed, and Applicant\u2019s insistent hearing claims that the sales papers faxed to\nhim by the seller after his disrupted test drive was a forgery.  \n \nFrom the evidence compiled in the record, inferences warrant that Applicant\nentered into some kind of lease or purchase arrangement with the seller that enabled the\nseller to release the vehicle to Applicant in April 2001 for a try out.  Whatever\narrangement Applicant worked out with the seller quite likely had a three-day trial period\n(a common requirement in most states).  Applicant\u2019s actions are consistent with his\nassuming some kind of purchase or lease of the vehicle when he drove it off the dealer\u2019s\nlot in April 2001 and took it on an extended in-state trip.  His trade-in of his own vehicle,\nhis continued monthly payments on the vehicle, and his settlement with the offender\u2019s\ninsurance company on repairs made by the seller or its designee all serve to strengthen\nthe case for an imputed  purchase or lease.\n Of course, were Applicant able to provide firm proof of a forged credit application,\nsuch proof could provide an affirmative defense to any purchase or lease claims of the\nseller (regardless of any other paperwork completed by Applicant).  But neither of the\nparties document any initiated legal proceedings to prove or disprove Applicant\u2019s forgery\nclaims, and the time for initiating any such claims would appear to have expired.  So,\nwithout more to corroborate Applicant\u2019s forgery fraud claims, there is enough evidence\nhere to draw material inferences of Applicant\u2019s acquired ownership or lease interest of\nthe disputed 2001 Mitsubishi SUV. \nFinding an Applicant purchase of his disputed vehicle arrangement does not end\nthe  matter.  Questions still persist about the overall merits and enforcement potential of\nthe seller\u2019s demanded deficiency. Based on the seller\u2019s demanded $18,072.00\ndeficiency (R.T., at 96), it is reasonably likely from the credit reports and other evidence\nthat Applicant was credited with his trade-in and his $5,562.00 in payments over the\n2001-2002 period.  It is much more doubtful, though, that he was ever credited with any\nproceeds produced by the seller\u2019s resale, release or public sale of the SUV in issue.\nCertainly, the seller and collection agency provide no evidence or clues as to how they\ncredited Applicant with the resale, release, or  the public sale of his fully repaired vehicle\n(compare exs. 2 through 4 and 10). \nFrom the correspondence produced, there is good reason to question the\naccuracy of the seller\u2019s reported deficiency claim.  All together, the compiled evidence\ncovering the seller\u2019s deficiency claim reflects a legitimate dispute of the merits of the\nSOR debt.  The creditor has reportedly agreed to remove the debt from Applicant\u2019s credit\nreport in exchange for Applicant\u2019s dropping his threatened legal action (see exs. 10, A\nand B; R.T., at 40).  Applicant\u2019s most recent October 2007 credit report (see ex. 3)\nreflects a transfer of sale of the account and no mention of the collection agent that\nacquired  the deficiency claim.  \n\n9\nApplicant assures that he has good credit and was able to recently purchase a\nLand Rover with an $11,500.00 down payment (R.T., at 42).  His accounts listed on his\nmost recent credit report are reported to be in current status (see exs. 3 and 4).\nApplicant is highly regarded by his Army command, former military and civilian law\nenforcement colleagues he has worked with over the years, and friends  He is\nconsidered trustworthy and beyond reproach in his professional and personal life (ex. B).\nHe is credited with spending considerable time in Iraq training police professionals and is\nvouched for in his endorsements as a man of outstanding moral character and personal\nintegrity (see ex. B).  \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if\nany, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or\ndenied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in\narriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\n\n10\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of\nrecord.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on\nspeculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a law enforcement professional with considerable experience in local\nand federal service (including a tour of duty in Iraq) who accumulated one major listed\ndebt in 2002 that he still disputes.  Without resolution that absolves Applicant from\nobligation for this listed debt, it raises initial security significant concerns.\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the\nperson at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s\nassociation with a major debt in his credit report and his past inability to resolve it\namicably, or by an initiated court action, warrants the application of two of the\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines for financial considerations: DC 19(a)\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and DC 19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s listed deficiency from a car repossession in 2002 is disputed by\nApplicant in just about every way possible: the absence of a signed purchase\nagreement, a produced forged sales agreement and credit application from the seller,\nquestionable sales tactics by the seller (e.g., the seller\u2019s demand for $14,000.00 to\nplace him in another vehicle),and  the seller\u2019s failure to properly credit him for the value\nof the car he turned back.  \n\n11\nFrom the testimony and documented accounts placed in evidence, there is sound\nreason to conclude that Applicant made some kind of purchase arrangement or lease\nwith the seller before driving off the lot with the vehicle. To create a sustainable meeting\nof the minds for contractual purposes, a party need not have a detailed sales agreement\nladen with fine print.  A simple memorandum of understanding specifying price, terms,\nand any trade-in credit could have been sufficient to create a purchase arrangement\nthat complied with the state\u2019s statute of frauds requirements. \n Here, Applicant\u2019s reliance on his own insurance company to cover his insurance\nneeds while test driving the SUV vehicle, his continued payments on the vehicle after he\nturned it over to the seller for repairs, his failure to recover his trade-in, and the common\nsense weighing of the plausibility of a dealer releasing a car for three days for extended\nin-state travel, collectively present strong indicators of a purchase or lease arrangement\nof some kind.  Whether or not his taking possession of the vehicle was pursuant to a\npurchase, a straight lease, or a lease/purchase, Applicant\u2019s probative actions at the very\nminimum created a contractual relationship between the parties sufficient to satisfy his\nState\u2019s statute of frauds.\nStill, all of the makings of a legitimate dispute are visible.  Failure of the seller to\nrecoup more money on a car it certified to be fully repaired with the responsible party\u2019s\ninsurer, the seller\u2019s failure to provide documentation of a valid, enforceable sales\nagreement, Applicant\u2019s forgery claims documented by affidavit and letters from his\nattorneys, the absence of any accounted for credits on the vehicle he turned back to the\nseller, and the collection agent\u2019s apparent willingness to delete the debt from Applicant\u2019s\ncredit reports without any documented payment arrangements, undermine any seller\nshowing of deficiency entitlement. \nWithout any more documented accounts of the transaction than the testimonials\nprovided by Applicant and his attorneys, evaluation of the parties\u2019 claims and defenses\nis considerably complicated. The best that can be said is that the listed deficiency\nremains a legitimate dispute, and quite possibly a credit entitlement of Applicant\u2019s.  So,\nunder these case specific circumstances, MC 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue,\u201d has applicability to the listed deficiency debt.  \nEven if the disputed deficiency debt can be resolved against Applicant on the\nmerits, mitigation credit is still available to Applicant based on the age of the debt\n(2002).  Age of the debt at issue is covered by two of the mitigating conditions for\nfinancial considerations: MC 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d has applicability,\nwhile not dispositive.  For this account, regardless of whether it reflects an otherwise\nvalid debt owing, it may no longer be enforceable under the State\u2019s applicable statute of\nlimitations for written contracts.  \n\n12\nThe state statute of limitations in Applicant\u2019s state for claims based on a written\ncontract is four years (see 16.004(a)(3) of T Civ. Practice and Remedies Code) and\nclaims not otherwise provided for (see 16.051 of T Civ. Practice and Remedies Code).  \nWhile Applicant may have continuing individual liability for this debt, there would appear\nto be little risk of collection on the debt which by the accounts of Applicant\u2019s attorney\nhas been resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWhile potentially applicable statutes of limitation have not been recognized by our\nAppeal Board to absorb security risks associated with unresolved delinquent debts.\nStatutes of limitation in general are considered important policy tools for discouraging\nplaintiffs from pursuing stale claims and promoting finality in litigation.  They have never\nbeen equated with good-faith efforts, though, to repay overdue creditors.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 02-30304, at 3 (App. Bd. April 2004)(quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020,\nat 5-6 (App. Bd. June 2001).\nWeight, if any, to be assigned to potential statutes of limitations under the new\nGuidelines should be considered in light of all the circumstances surrounding the\nexisting debts, and must take account of the Applicant\u2019s entire history of demonstrated\ntrust and responsibility.  Viewed in this whole person light, the controlling state statute of\nlimitation for written contracts is entitled to be accorded significant mitigation weight in\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s overall financial risk. \n                                                 \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.\nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the\nprincipal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in\nfinancial cases (as here).\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\nonly listed debt, his documented steps taken to resolve the dispute over the debt with\nthe seller and its collection agent, and an overall whole-person assessment of his\ndemonstrated responsibility and trustworthiness in his work and financial relationships\nwith his creditors over time, Applicant mitigates security concerns related to his disputed\ndebt.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegation covered by sub-\nparagraph 1.a of the SOR.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\n\n13\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nClearance is granted.\n                                          \nRoger C.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant committed driving under the influence (DUI) offenses in 1984, 1990,\n1996, and 2006. He was convicted of marijuana possession in 1986, and was\ndischarged from the Navy for drug abuse in 1989. He has abstained from drug use\nsince 1990, and from alcohol use since January 2006. He has changed his lifestyle and\nis committed to sobriety. Applicant is making significant progress but, given his long\nhistory of substance abuse, insufficient time has passed since his last relapse to\ndemonstrate permanent behavioral change. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied. \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigation Processing\n(e-QIP), on May 1, 2007. On November 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guidelines G, H, E, and J for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nApril 17, 2008\n\n2\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 12, 2007. He\nanswered the SOR in writing, undated, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received that request on January 14, 2008. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on January 25, 2008, and the case was assigned to\nme on January 28, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 4, 2008, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on February 22, 2008. The Government offered\nexhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were admitted without objection. The Government also\noffered Administrative Notice (AN) exhibits 1 and 2, two sections of the Controlled\nSubstances Act of 1970, to support a request that I take administrative notice of the fact\nthat marijuana is a controlled substance. Applicant had no objection, and administrative\nnotice of this fact was taken. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted\nexhibits (AE) A through D, which were admitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s wife also\ntestified for him. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 3, 2008.\nWhile reviewing the evidence, I noticed that the first page of GE 1 was the signature\npage from another applicant\u2019s e-QIP, that was mistakenly substituted for Applicant\u2019s\nsignature page. Department Counsel obtained and provided the correct page, which I\nappended to the record, together with accompanying email correspondence, as Hearing\nExhibit (HE) I. Applicant offered no objection, and the record was reopened on\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s motion, to substitute the correct signature page into GE 1. The\noriginal remains attached to that exhibit to ensure that the record is complete, but is not\notherwise material to this decision.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations concerning\nalcohol consumption, drug involvement, and criminal conduct, and denied deliberately\nfailing to disclose some of his DUI and drug offenses on his e-QIP under personal\nconduct. Applicant\u2019s admissions, including those contained in his response to DOHA\nInterrogatories (GE 3), are incorporated in the following findings.\nApplicant is a 40-year-old computer technician employed by a major defense\ncontractor. Except for a year of unemployment and ten months with another company,\nhe has worked for his present employer since 1996. He was recently promoted into his\npresent position, and his recent performance evaluations are good. (AE B.) He has\nnever held a security clearance.\nIn 1984, when he was 16 years old, Applicant was charged and convicted of\nUnderage Drinking and Driving. He was fined, had his license suspended, and was\nrequired to attend an alcohol awareness class. In January 1986, while still in high\nschool, he was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana. He paid a $40 fine\nfor this offense. After graduating, he joined the Navy in August 1986. He used marijuana\n\n3\nseveral times with other Sailors during his enlistment. After testing positive on a\nurinalysis test, he was awarded non-judicial punishment, and separated with an other-\nthan-honorable discharge for misconduct-drug abuse in August 1989. (Tr. at 58-60.)\nApplicant smoked marijuana a few more times after leaving the service, but has\nnot done so since October 14,1990. (Tr. at 66-67.) On that date, he was arrested for\nDUI. He pled guilty to that offense, served a week in jail, had his license suspended for\na year, and was ordered to complete a two-year intensive outpatient treatment program.\n(Tr. at 48-50.) He was arrested for DUI again in 1996. He obtained a deferred\nprosecution on condition that he satisfactorily complete another two-year intensive\noutpatient treatment program, which he did. \nApplicant resumed drinking in late 2005. He was arrested again for DUI on\nJanuary 12, 2006, after wrecking his car in a single-car accident. He had been drinking\nwhiskey at home, before driving to a fast-food restaurant. His blood-alcohol level was\nmore than three times the legal limit. He was convicted of this offense in May 2006, and\nsentenced to five days in jail, a $1,121 fine, 40 days of home monitoring, and\nsuspension of his driver\u2019s license. He was also ordered to participate in another\nintensive outpatient treatment program. He completed this program, with a favorable\nprognosis from his program counselor, in December 2006. (AE A.) Since this last\ntreatment, he has changed his lifestyle, and married his wife who is fully supporting his\nongoing abstinence. He is also receiving ongoing follow-up counseling. (AE C; AE D; Tr.\nat 54-58, 69-72, 74-78.)\nWhen Applicant completed his e-QIP security clearance application, he answered\n\u201cYes\u201d to question 23.d, concerning whether he had ever been charged with or convicted\nof any offenses related to alcohol or drugs. In the section seeking details concerning\naffirmative answers about his police record, he listed his January 2006 DUI offense, but\nnone of the earlier offenses noted above. During an interview with an OPM investigator\non June 20, 2007, however, he volunteered what information he could recall about the\nthree earlier DUI offenses. He testified very credibly that he had no intention of\nconcealing the earlier convictions, which he was certain the Government would have\naccess to. He misunderstood that this particular question was not limited to the past\nseven years, like many of the other questions.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\n\n4\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption:\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d AG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying. The disqualifying condition asserted by the Government in\nthis case is: \u201c(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent.\u201d\n\n5\nApplicant has four DUI convictions over the past 23 years, starting at age 16. His\nmost recent conviction was just over two years ago, in January 2006, and involved\nblood-alcohol levels more than three times the legal limit. He attended an alcohol\nawareness class after his first conviction, and intensive outpatient treatment programs\nafter each of the last three. There were six years between his first three DUIs, and ten\nyears between the third and fourth. The Government has established security concerns\nunder this guideline.\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and,\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\n\u00b6 23(a) does not provide mitigation because Applicant\u2019s DUI offenses have been\nfrequent and the latest one was fairly recent. Both the pattern and the recency of this\nlast incident continue to cast doubt on his trustworthiness and good judgment. His\nhistory of relapses after court-ordered treatment programs also precludes mitigation\nunder \u00b6 23(c). He has acknowledged his alcoholism, changed his lifestyle, and began a\nperiod of abstinence following his January 2006 arrest.  He also completed his most\nrecent outpatient treatment program successfully, and received a favorable prognosis\nfrom the social worker who served as his program counselor. These efforts do generate\nsome mitigation of security concerns under \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and 23(d). \n\n6\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \u201cUse of\nan illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying. Disqualifying conditions raised by the SOR allegations include: \u201c(a) any\ndrug abuse;\u201d and \u201c(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d\nApplicant was fined for marijuana possession when he was a high school senior\nin 1986. He also used marijuana several times from 1986 to 1990, during and shortly\nafter his naval service. He was discharged under other-than-honorable conditions for\ndrug use. The Government established facts necessary to raise security concerns under\nthis guideline.\nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Mitigating\nconditions supported on this record include:\u201c(a) the behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\u201d and \u201c(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:\n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the\nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, (4) a\nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s drug possession and use occurred more than 18 years ago, and primarily\nwith high school or service friends. He was an occasional user, and he no longer\nassociates with drug users. Applicant established substantial mitigation of drug\ninvolvement security concerns.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The disqualifying condition alleged in this case is:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\n\n7\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nApplicant credibly denied that he intentionally omitted information about his pre-\n1998 criminal charges related to alcohol and drugs on his e-QIP. His explanation of\nconfusion based on the \u201clast 7 years\u201d limitation on other questions concerning these\nincidents was reasonable. Moreover, AG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate\npersonal conduct security concerns, including \u201c(a) the individual made prompt, good-\nfaith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts.\u201d Applicant volunteered the information about the earlier DUI\noffenses to the OPM investigator, further demonstrating the absence of any intent to\nconceal them and mitigating any security concerns raised by the initial omission.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying. Disqualifying conditions asserted by the Government were:\n\u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\u201d and \u201c(c) allegation or admission\nof criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted or convicted.\u201d The crimes alleged in the SOR include Applicant\u2019s four DUI\nconvictions, his drug possession conviction, and falsification of his e-QIP in violation of\n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Applicant admitted to commission of all but this latter offense. As\ndiscussed above, the evidence does not establish that he deliberately falsified his e-\nQIP. The other criminal offenses do raise security concerns, however.\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Applicant\u2019s\nrecent sobriety, completion of an outpatient treatment program, good work performance,\nand lifestyle changes create some mitigation under two of them: \u201c(a) so much time has\nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d and, \u201c(d) there is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d\nSome of Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct occurred many years ago, but his criminal\nhistory must be evaluated as a whole, not piece by piece. All of his crimes have\ninvolved illegal substance abuse, and were indicative of poor judgment and a lack of\nself-control, as well as a willingness to flaunt rules and regulations. With another relapse\nand serious drunk driving conviction just over two years ago, Applicant did not establish\nstrong mitigation of the concerns arising from his criminal history. He suffered relapses\nresulting in additional DUI convictions six and ten years after his first two intensive\n\n8\noutpatient treatment programs, leading to the conclusion that it is still too soon, since he\ncompleted his most recent treatment, to be confident that such behavior is unlikely to\nrecur, and no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and judgment. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances established by the record evidence. The\nAdministrative Judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG\n\u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern involved a pattern of recurring substance-abuse related offenses including a\nfairly recent and serious DUI offense. He successfully completed post-conviction\ntreatment programs after each offense, but suffered subsequent relapses. His earliest\noffenses occurred when he was young and immature, but his more recent convictions\ntook place when he was mature and fully responsible for his choices. He mitigated\nsecurity concerns arising solely from his drug abuse many years ago, but did not\nmitigate their impact as part of a larger pattern of criminal behavior.\nThere is no evidence that Applicant was pressured to commit any offense by\nanything beyond normal life pressures to which he remains subject. He has made\npositive lifestyle changes, and gained a very positive influence in his recent marriage to\nhis very supportive wife. His behavior and good work performance since January 2006\ncreate an excellent start on building a record of more responsible and trustworthy\nconduct, and provide a sound basis on which to build eligibility for a security clearance\nin the future. The number and recency of relapses, however, preclude a present\njudgment that Applicant has met his burden of mitigating the security concerns raised by\nthe undisputed evidence in this record. \n\n9\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as\nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from alcohol\nconsumption and criminal conduct considerations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 4, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 4.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 4.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 4.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: David B. Gates, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant committed a DUI in 2002, and was convicted of a lesser offense after\ncompleting a pretrial diversion agreement and alcohol treatment. He falsely reported\nidentity theft in 2005 to avoid a phone bill, and ran away from the scene of a minor\naccident in 2006. He deliberately omitted being charged with the false reporting offense\non his clearance application. He mitigated alcohol security concerns, but not those\narising from his criminal and personal conduct. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied. \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on May 10, 2006. On January 25, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guidelines E, G, and J for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nAugust 26, 2008\n\n2\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 6, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing (Answer) on March 15, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on April 16, 2008,\nand the case was assigned to me on April 25, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing\non May 6, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 29, 2008. The\nGovernment offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were admitted without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted exhibits (AE) A and B, which were\nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 5,\n2008.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the truth of all of the factual\nallegations set forth in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s admissions, including those contained in his\nresponse to DOHA Interrogatories (GE 3), are incorporated in the following findings.\nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked as a\nmechanic with a security clearance for about ten years. He served on active duty in the\nNavy for nine years before that. He is divorced with two sons, who live with his former\nwife. He currently resides with his girlfriend and her teenage daughter. He has been\nscreened and approved to help coach that daughter\u2019s recreational softball team.\nOn October 5, 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the\ninfluence (DUI), after he drove his truck off a road and down an embankment. SOR \u00b6\n1.c incorrectly identifies the name of the county in which this took place, but is otherwise\naccurate. He initially testified during the hearing that he was arrested while walking\nseveral blocks away from his vehicle, and that some other person had been the one\ndriving it after they left the casino where they had been drinking. He said he pled guilty\nto get the charge reduced as part of a pretrial diversion agreement, and that he was\nonly arrested because the vehicle was registered to him. He further stated that he could\nnot recall his blood alcohol content (BAC), but that the .08% BAC level stated in the\nSOR was \u201cfairly accurate.\u201d (Tr. at 53-55, 63-66.) In later testimony, Applicant admitted\nthat he had been the driver when the truck left the road shortly before he was arrested,\nand his BAC was .145% when tested after his arrest. He explained his earlier version of\nevents was given because he did not understand Department Counsel\u2019s questions. (Tr.\nat 78-80; GE 3 at 97-99.)\nApplicant successfully completed the pretrial diversion agreement, resulting in\nthe DUI charge being reduced to first degree negligent driving. He was convicted of this\nlesser offense, and sentenced to 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine, both of which were\nsuspended, and two years of unsupervised probation on February 23, 2005. (GE 3 at\n83-96.) As part of his diversion agreement, he underwent an alcohol assessment and\n\n3\ntreatment program. On June 3, 2004, the social worker/chemical dependency\nprofessional who evaluated him found sufficient evidence to establish a DSM IV\ndiagnosis of 305.00, Alcohol Abuse, that by Applicant\u2019s self-report appeared to be in\nremission. Applicant successfully completed the prescribed four-point outpatient\ntreatment plan on October 6, 2004. (AE A; GE 3 at 105-111.) He abstained from\ndrinking during the treatment program, but resumed drinking in moderate amounts\nthereafter and stated that he planned to continue to drink socially in the future. (Tr. at\n46, 56-59; GE 3 at 5-6.)\nApplicant and his wife went through a bitter separation and divorce from early\n2004 until March 2005. During this time, his wife filed many complaints against\nApplicant, none of which was sufficiently substantiated to support prosecution after\ninvestigation. As alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.c, she did obtain an ex parte temporary restraining\norder against him that was dismissed once he was able to respond to the allegations at\na hearing on whether the order should be continued. Her allegations were not\nsubstantiated on this occasion either. (GE 1 at 16; GE 3; Tr. at 42-45.)\nIn late November 2004, Applicant was contacted by a collection agency\nregarding a past due $274.50 account with a cell phone company. He claimed that he\nhad never had service with that company, and filed an identity theft complaint with the\npolice. In connection with the investigation, his wife provided the police with copies of\naccount statements related to this telephone account which Applicant had opened in\n2000, maintained at two addresses where they had lived, and subsequently closed. She\nalso reported that he had cashed a $150 rebate check from the company. When\nconfronted with this information by the investigator, Applicant reportedly insisted it was a\n\u201crefund\u201d vice \u201crebate\u201d check, a distinction he repeated during the hearing for some\nundetermined reason. (GE 3 at 45; Tr. at 82.) The investigator explained to Applicant\nthat he was going to charge him with false reporting, and Applicant reportedly\nunderstood that. This criminal complaint was filed on May 10, 2005. On September 1,\n2005, the district court judge dismissed the charge without prejudice on motion of the\nprosecution due to insufficient evidence. (GE 3 at 32-50.) \nOn February 23, 2007, Applicant was asked about this false reporting charge in a\npersonal subject interview by an OPM investigator.  On October 19, 2007, in his sworn\nresponse to written interrogatories, he attested to the accuracy of the information\ncontained in this interview report. He told the investigator that his wife had obtained the\ncell phone in his name without his knowledge or permission. He acknowledged\nreceiving notice of the pending charges in the mail from the court. He stated that he\nappeared in the district court, told his side of the story, his wife was not present, and the\ncharge was dismissed by the court due to lack of evidence. He stated that he did not list\nthis charge on his e-QIP in response to question 23f because it had been dismissed and\nhe misunderstood the question asking whether he had been arrested for, charged with,\nor convicted of any offenses in the past seven years. During the hearing, Applicant\ntestified that he never knew he was charged with any offense in connection with this\nfalse report, but got notification by mail that it was dismissed. (GE 1 at 24; GE 3 at 10-\n11, 112-114; Tr. at 33-36, 50-53, 82-84.) \n\n4\nOn August 6, 2006, Applicant was driving his SUV out of the parking lot after\nanother night at the casino. He ran into the rear of a car in front of him at a stop sign.\nHis girlfriend was in the front passenger seat and two very intoxicated friends were\nriding in the rear passenger seat. Applicant\u2019s version of subsequent events differs in\nsome particulars from those of the other participants, as recorded in the police report he\nprovided. It is not disputed, however, that he fled the scene on foot, crossed a major\nroad into a wooded area, and was later found by police lying with his head atop and\nbody stretched down the embankment at the shoulder of the road. He was apprehended\nand hand-cuffed. (The findings concerning this incident are based on GE 3 at 13-23,\n112-113, and Tr. at 32-33, 49-50, 73-78, and 80-81.)\nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend was apprehended by a responding police unit as she drove\nthe SUV some distance away from the casino. She and one of the other passengers\nboth reported that Applicant was driving at the time of the collision, then got out of the\nSUV and told the girlfriend to take the car and leave. The girlfriend reported seeing\nApplicant go into the casino before she left. The occupants of the other car also\nreported that he first ran into the casino, then ran back out and crossed the road into the\nwoods. Applicant testified at the hearing that he did not go into the casino, but ran\ndirectly across the road and into the woods because four guys jumped out of the back\nseat of the other car, tried to attack him and chased him across the road. The police\nreport documents that the car held three men, one of whom was driving, and three\nwomen. In his subsequently adopted OPM interview, Applicant stated that he had\nconsumed one alcoholic drink between 8:30 and 9:00 that evening, but nothing else\nbetween then and the 1:30 a.m. accident because he was the designated driver. (GE 3\nat 112.) During the hearing, he testified that he had been at the casino dancing, not\ndrinking or gambling. \u201cNo. I did not have anything to drink that night, sir.\u201d (Tr. at 50, 78.)\nThe police officer who arrested Applicant and held him in custody until the following\nmorning reported that, after being informed that he was under arrest, Applicant \u201cstated\nhe didn\u2019t do anything wrong and seemed to be intoxicated.\u201d (GE 3 at 21.) \nApplicant provided a copy of the formal charging document filed against him in\ndistrict court on November 2, 2006. (GE 3 at 13, 14, 16.) He told the OPM interviewer\nand testified during the hearing that the charges were dropped after he and his\ninsurance company paid for the damages to the other car. Unlike the documents\nprovided relating to other criminal complaints against him, however, he provided no\ndocumentation corroborating his assertion that the charges were dropped. (Tr. at 74.)\nApplicant provided evidence showing that his supervisors delegate him authority\nto serve as the maintenance building day-shift hourly group lead during temporary\nabsences of his group\u2019s regular supervisor. He also provided performance reviews and\nletters of recommendation from supervisors and co-workers documenting his good work\nperformance, integrity, trustworthiness and loyalty. There is no evidence of any security\nproblem or violation involving Applicant during the period he held a clearance. (AE B; Tr.\nat 31-32, 39-41, 66-67.) Based on the inconsistencies noted above, some apparent\nevasions of direct questions, and observation of his demeanor during the hearing,\nApplicant\u2019s testimony was less than credible. \n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n\n6\nProcedural Issues\nOn motion of Department Counsel, and without objection by Applicant or his\ncounsel, the SOR was amended to insert \u00b6 2.d, \u201cThat information set forth in paragraph\n1.c above.\u201d This amendment incorporated the 2002 DUI incident under the Guideline G,\nalcohol consumption, allegations in addition to its original allegation under Guideline J\nfor criminal conduct. Applicant\u2019s counsel stated they had sufficient notice of both the\ncriminal and alcohol-related nature of this incident. (Tr. at 70-72.) \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying. Disqualifying conditions asserted by the Government were:\n\u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\u201d and \u201c(c) allegation or admission\nof criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted or convicted.\u201d (Tr. at 89.) Applicant admitted that he committed DUI in 2002\nwith a BAC of .145, resulting in his eventual conviction of first degree negligent driving.\nHe also admitted to his 2006 hit and run offense, in which he fled the scene to hide in\nthe woods after rear-ending another car at a stop sign. He denied being intoxicated at\nthe time, despite the arresting officer\u2019s report to the contrary. His conduct on this\noccasion, even if not alcohol-related, supports significant concerns about his judgment,\nreliability and willingness to comply with laws and rules. Although the prosecution\nmoved for and was granted dismissal of the false reporting charge without prejudice,\nsubstantial evidence establishes that Applicant did commit this offense as well,\nattempting to evade a legitimate financial obligation through false accusations of\nwrongdoing by others. These offenses, individually and collectively, raise security\nconcerns under the aforementioned disqualifying conditions.\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security\nconcerns. Applicant\u2019s completion of an outpatient alcohol treatment program,\ncommunity involvement and good work performance were offered to establish some\nmitigation under two of them: \u201c(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\u201d and \u201c(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s DUI offense occurred almost six years ago, but his criminal history\nmust be evaluated as a whole, not piece by piece. His attempt to establish mitigation\n\n7\nunder \u00b6 32(c), \u201cevidence that the person did not commit the offense,\u201d with respect to the\nfalse reporting offense was not persuasive. Although his criminal actions in 2005 and\n2006 are not considered individually to be serious offenses, the pattern precludes\nreaching a conclusion that \u201csuch conduct is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nApplicant\u2019s current reliability or good judgment.\u201d He has pursued constructive\ncommunity involvement in youth sports, and performed well at work. However, barely\ntwo years have passed since his last criminal offense, which actually occurred after he\nsubmitted the security clearance application under present adjudication.\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption:\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d AG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying. The disqualifying conditions asserted by the Government in\nthis case are: \u201c(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent;\u201d \u201c(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent;\u201d and \u201c(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or dependence by a\nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment\nprogram.\u201d\nApplicant admitted to consuming alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of\nintoxication, from approximately 1986 until at least October 2007, and that he continues\nto consume alcohol in his answer to the SOR. The clinical social worker in his court-\nordered alcohol treatment program diagnosed him with alcohol abuse. Although his\nspouse obtained a temporary protection order based on allegations of threatening and\nviolent behavior toward her when Applicant consumed alcohol, those accusations were\nnever substantiated. He committed a DUI offense, with a BAC reading of .145, in\nOctober 2002. The Government has established security concerns under this guideline,\nshifting the burden of proof to Applicant to mitigate those concerns.\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n\n8\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant established mitigation under \u00b6 23(a) with respect to his single 2002 DUI\nincident. His 2006 hit and run was not processed as an alcohol-related incident despite\nthe arresting officer\u2019s report that Applicant appeared intoxicated. He acknowledged his\nalcohol abuse diagnosis and successfully completed the prescribed treatment program\nin 2004, without further documented alcohol-related incidents. There is no evidence of\nanything other than moderate and responsible alcohol use since he completed that\nprogram, and the program completion report contained a generally favorable prognosis.\nThese matters generate further mitigation of alcohol consumption security concerns\nunder \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and 23(d). The allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.c, although admitted, does not\nsupport alcohol consumption security concerns because the reported accusations were\nnot substantiated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The disqualifying condition alleged in the SOR and raised by the evidence\nin this case is:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\n\n9\nApplicant omitted responsive information about his 2005 false reporting charge,\nin response to question 23 on his May 2006 e-QIP. He certified the completeness and\naccuracy of his answers, acknowledging the obligation to be truthful. He provided\ndocumentation showing that he was formally charged with this offense, and the police\ninvestigator who brought the charge informed him in person that he intended to do so.\nHis rationale during his hearing for failing to report this charge differed markedly from\nthe one he gave to the OPM investigator and later ratified as being true in his\ninterrogatory response. Neither attempted justification for the omission was persuasive.\nThe final court action on this charge, to which he had to respond and which he seemed\nto consider unjust, occurred just over eight months before he certified the accuracy of\nhis e-QIP. The weight of evidence in this record leads to the conclusion that his\nomission of relevant information concerning this criminal charge in response to question\n23 was deliberate. \nApplicant did not disclose any information about this criminal charge until he was\nasked about it by the OPM investigator during his February 23, 2007 personal subject\ninterview. This does not establish the personal conduct mitigating condition set forth in\nAG \u00b6 17(a): \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d His conflicting\nstatements about why he omitted this information significantly undermine the credibility\nof his assertion that he did not intend to mislead the Government about the existence of\nthis charge and his underlying actions that gave rise to it. He neither asserted nor\nestablished any other personal conduct mitigating condition with respect to this\nomission.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances established by the record evidence. The\nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n  \n\n10\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern involved a relatively serious DUI offense in 2002, when he drove his truck off\nthe road and down a steep embankment with passengers involved. Fortunately, no\ninjuries were reported, but his BAC at the time was .145%, almost twice the legal limit of\n.08%. Neither of his subsequent criminal offenses was particularly serious, but both\ninvolved intentional wrongful conduct in attempts to avoid fulfilling his legal\nresponsibilities. The most recent of these incidents was only two years ago, and\noccurred after submission of the clearance application that is under present\nconsideration. All of these incidents took place while Applicant was fully mature and\naccountable for his choices. He demonstrated alcohol rehabilitation through successful\ncompletion of a treatment program, and responsible use subsequent to his diagnosis of\nalcohol abuse. However, he did not establish either rehabilitation or permanent\nbehavioral changes with respect to his pattern of criminal violations or the falsification of\nhis security clearance application. In fact, he presented less than credible testimony\nconcerning several aspects of these incidents during the hearing. This record\ndemonstrates Applicant\u2019s susceptibility to choosing to violate laws and rules when\npressured to do so in his own self-interest, and he did not establish that recurrence of\nsuch behavior is unlikely. His good work performance, community involvement, and\nabsence of past security violations are commendable, but are not sufficient to outweigh\nthe security concerns established by his admissions and the evidence as a whole. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal conduct and\npersonal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on May 25, \n2006. On November 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn December 31, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested \nthat his case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government \nApril 22, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \ncompiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on February 2, 2008. The FORM \ncontained documents identified as Items 1 through 8.  By letter dated February 5, 2008, \na copy of the FORM was forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any \nadditional information and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received \nthe file on February 26, 2008.  His response was due on March 26, 2008. He did not \nsubmit any additional information within the required time period.  On April 17, 2008, the \ncase was assigned to me for a decision.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains 23 allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial \nConsiderations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.w.) (Item 1.) In his Answer to the SOR, dated \nDecember 31, 2007, Applicant admitted 18 of the allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.q., \u00b6 \n1.v.); he denied four allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.r., 1.t., 1.u., and 1.w.); and he did not address the \nfactual allegation at \u00b6 1.s. of the SOR. He also provided additional information to \nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  (Item 3.) \n \n \nApplicant is 32 years old and never married.  Since June 2004, he has been \nemployed as a network engineer by a government contractor. From about October 2001 \nto about May 2003, Applicant was employed as a senior network engineer by Company \nA. He was one of 250 employees at Company A.  In 1999, while employed by the \nFederal government, Applicant was granted a security clearance. (Attachment to Item 3; \nItem 4.) \n \n \nIn May 2003, Applicant purchased a home for an undisclosed amount and \nassumed a monthly mortgage payment of $2,000.  Five days after Applicant signed his \nmortgage agreement, his employer filed for bankruptcy, an action that left him and the \nother employees of Company A without health insurance.  Two weeks later, Applicant \nwas diagnosed with testicular cancer.  (Attachment to Item 3.) \n \n \nIn May 2003, Applicant began a year-long course of chemotherapy treatment for \nhis cancer.  The treatment was intense and he was unable to work during this time.  His \nmother and brother helped him with his mortgage, utilities, car payments, and food.  His \nfamily members also paid some of his medical expenses. Applicant charged some of his  \nadditional medical expenses on his credit cards.  (Attachment to Item 3.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged, and Applicant admitted, that he owed approximately $18,670 \nto medical providers (\u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.o., 1.p., and 1.v.).  The SOR also \nalleged, and Applicant admitted, that he owed approximately $40,719 to credit card \ncompanies for debts incurred in 2003 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.h.).  The SOR alleged, and \nApplicant admitted a judgment against him for $9,394 in favor of an automobile credit \ncompany (\u00b6 1.i.). The SOR alleged, and Applicant admitted, approximately $28,920 in \nadditional consumer debt (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.j., 1.k., 1.l., 1.m., 1.n, and 1.q.). He denied three \ndebts to communication providers totaling $899 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.r., 1.t., and 1.u.). All three \naccounts were listed on his credit bureau report of August 4, 2006, and Applicant \nprovided no credible evidence to rebut the allegations that the debts belonged to him \n\n \n3 \n \n \nand remained unpaid. (Item 6.) He also denied a SOR allegation that his personal \nfinancial statement showed a net monthly remainder of $299 and did not reflect monthly \npayments for many of the debts alleged in the SOR (\u00b6 1.w.).  (Item 1; Item 3.) \n \n \nApplicant did not address a debt of $189 alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.s.  His credit bureau \nreports of August 8, 2006, November 6, 2007, and January 15, 2008 show that the \ncollection account identified at SOR \u00b61.a. has the same account number as the \ncollection account identified at SOR \u00b61.s.  Applicant admitted the SOR allegation at \n\u00b61.a. and was correct in not admitting the duplicate allegation at \u00b6 1.s.  Accordingly, the \nallegation at \u00b6 1.s. is concluded for Applicant.  (Item 6; Item 7; Item 8.)  \n \n \nApplicant responded to financial interrogatories from DOHA on October 16, 2007. \nIn his response, he provided a sworn statement reporting that his total net monthly \nincome was $3,944.  He listed $3,120 in fixed monthly expenses.  Additionally, he \nreported that he was paying $75 a month to the automobile judgment creditor listed at \u00b6 \n1.i. of the SOR.  He provided corroborative evidence of payments of $75 paid to the \njudgment creditor in May, June, July, August, September and October 2007. (Item 5 at \n4, 7.) \n \n \nApplicant also stated he was making payments of $150 a month to a creditor to \nwhom he owed approximately $10,000.  He provided corroborative evidence that he \nhad made payment of $1,200 to the creditor on October 17, 2007 and had a scheduled \npayment of $150 to the creditor on November 15, 2007.  (Item 5 at 9.) \n \n \nIn remarks attached to his financial statement, Applicant stated he owed a \n$12,000 personal debt to a family member and was paying $300 a month on the debt.  \nHe stated he had two payments remaining on the debt, and, when the debt was \nsatisfied, he would begin to pay on his remaining financial obligations. He failed to \nprovide credible evidence to corroborate his remarks. (Item 5 at 4, 11.) \n \n \nOn his SF-86, Applicant reported a month of foreign travel for pleasure in March \nand April 2006.  In extended remarks attached to his SF-86, he stated he had elected \nnot to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy because he believed he had a responsibility to pay \nhis creditors.  He stated he was paying his outstanding debts one at a time.  He failed to \nprovide evidence he had contacted his creditors to discuss future payment plans.  The \nrecord does not suggest that Applicant has participated in consumer credit counseling.  \n(Item 4 at 20, 27.) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unable to \npay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying \nconditions, requiring a closer examination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, such as loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might be \napplicable include evidence the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol. (AG \u00b6 20(c) or the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. (AG \u00b6 20 (d))  \n \nMost of Applicant=s financial delinquencies arose between May 2003 and May \n2004, when he purchased a home, lost his health insurance coverage, was \nsubsequently diagnosed with cancer, a medical condition which required expensive \ntreatment, and was unable to work while under treatment. These circumstances \noccurred nearly five years ago and have resulted in overwhelming debt which continues \nto the present day, a situation which raises concerns about Applicant\u2019s good judgment.   \n \nApplicant was unable to work for nearly a year and relied on family members to \nhelp him pay medical bills and living expenses. Once his health improved, Applicant \nwas able to acquire another job, which he has held for nearly four years. During that \ntime, Applicant has not contacted the majority of his creditors to arrange payment plans \nto initiate settlement, nor has he sought consumer credit counseling. He asserts he has \ntwo more payments of $300 remaining to retire a $12,000 debt to a family member, but \nhe provided no evidence to corroborate his assertion.  He provided financial records to \nshow he began to pay two other creditors in 2007. He has no plan in place to \n\n \n6 \n \n \nsystematically resolve his substantial delinquent debt and prepare for future \ncontingencies. I conclude that AG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(d) apply in part in mitigation, but \nthat AG \u00b6 20(a) and AG \u00b6 20(c) do not apply in mitigation to the facts of Applicant\u2019s \ncase. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems first began, \nApplicant was a young man. (See AG & 2(a)(4).) He accumulated debt due to \ncircumstances largely beyond his control, including the loss of his health insurance, a \ndiagnosis of cancer, and large, unexpected medical expenses. (See AG & 2(a)(2).) In \nthe nearly five years since that time, however, Applicant has not taken affirmative action \nto pay or resolve the majority of his delinquent debts, and this continues to raise \nsecurity concerns.  He has held his current job since June 2004, and he had sufficient \ndiscretionary income to travel abroad for a month in 2006.  He has initiated payment on \nthree of his debts, but he has not used his remaining monthly discretionary income to \nsatisfy any of his many other debts.   (See AG & 2(a)(6).)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation arises from unusual circumstances, and he may \nfind it beneficial to seek professional financial counseling and legal advice about \nresolving his debts and acquiring financial stability in the near term.  Applicant can \nreapply for a security clearance one year after the date that this decision becomes final.  \nIf he wishes, he can produce new evidence that addresses the Government\u2019s current \nsecurity concerns.    \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Crowley, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJuly 10, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn January 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 2, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on March 18, 2008. Applicant did not file a\nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on May 29, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 44 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nIn 1996, a judgment in favor of a bank in the amount of $1,679.00 was entered\nagainst applicant. The debt remains outstanding.\nIn 1998, a judgment in favor of Zale Jewelers in the amount of $2,282.00 was\nentered against applicant. The debt remains outstanding.\nIn 1999, a judgment in favor of Hechts in the amount of $329.00 was entered\nagainst applicant. The debt remains outstanding.\nIn 1999, a judgment in favor of Citibank in the amount of $8,556.00 was entered\nagainst applicant. The debt remains outstanding.\nApplicant is indebted to Pace Financial in the approximate amount of $2,430.00.\nThis debt was placed for collection in 2000 and remains outstanding.\nApplicant is indebted to Union Acceptance in the approximate amount of\n$216.00. This debt was charged off in 2000 and remains outstanding.\nApplicant became indebted to Montgomery Wards in the approximate amount of\n$891.00 many years ago. As of August 2004, the debt remained unpaid.\nApplicant became indebted to JC Penney/Arrow Financial Services in the\napproximate amount of $787.00 many years ago. As of October 2004, the debt\nremained unpaid.\nApplicant became indebted to Bank of America in the approximate amount of\n$5,373.00 many years ago. The debt was charged off, and as of July 2001, it remained\nunpaid.\nApplicant became indebted to Peebles in the approximate amount of $51.00\nmany years ago. The debt was charged off, and as of July 2001, it had not been paid.\nApplicant became indebted to Sears/Risk Management Alternatives in the\napproximate amount of $620.00 many years ago. The debt was placed for collection,\nand as of July 2001, it had not been paid.\nIn his response to the SOR and in Exhibit 7, applicant stated that he has been\nunable to pay his debts during the past eight years due to a bad relationship with his\nformer fiancee, the financial support he has been providing to his mother, \u201cjudgments\nagainst [his] paycheck,\u201d and poor management of his credit cards.\n\n3\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\n\n4\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. The evidence shows applicant has a long history of an inability\nor unwillingness to pay his debts. Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are\napplicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph 20.a. may apply\nwhere \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Although applicant\u2019s numerous\ndebts appear to have been incurred years ago, they are still outstanding. His current\ninability or unwillingness to address them casts doubt on his current judgment, reliability\nand trustworthiness. Accordingly, this mitigation condition is not applicable.\nUnder Paragraph 20.b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\nstated that a bad relationship, support provided to his mother, judgments, and poor\nmanagement of his credit cards caused his financial problems and prevented him from\nsatisfying his long-standing debts. Although these \u201cconditions\u201d may very well have\ncaused applicant\u2019s financial problems, they were not largely beyond his control.\nAccordingly, this mitigating condition is not applicable.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph c. This mitigation condition does not apply.\nParagraph d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d This mitigating\ncondition does not apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\n\n5\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature man who has\na history of not meeting his financial obligations. Although the debts listed in the SOR\nappear to have been incurred years ago, applicant\u2019s continuing inability or unwillingness\nto address them reflects adversely on his current judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness. Based on the foregoing, I conclude applicant failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns arising from Guideline F.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant received the FORM on April 17, 2009, \nand did not respond. The case was assigned to me on June 12, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the all the allegations in the SOR. \nHis admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old supply chain specialist employed by a federal \ncontractor.

He has one child, \nfor whom he pays child support, and one stepchild.  \n \n \nApplicant served in the U.S. Navy from April 1992 to July 1999. In January 1996, \nhe received nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice \n(UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815, for being disrespectful to a superior petty officer, in violation \nof Article 91, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 891 (GX 16). In July 1997, he was convicted by civilian \nauthorities of driving under the influence (DUI) (GX 9 at 2). In March 1999, he received \nnonjudicial punishment for violating a lawful order, being drunk on duty, and drunk \ndriving, in violation of Articles 92, 112, and 111, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 892, 912, and 911 \nGX 15). He was discharged from the Navy in July 1999 with an Other than Honorable \nDischarge (GX 4 at 22).  \n \n \nIn May 2000, Applicant was involved in an argument with his wife. He pushed his \nwife as she was shouting at him, and she struck him in the head with a trophy. The \npolice charged him with assault and battery. After the altercation, he left town until \nAugust 2000, thinking his wife would withdraw her complaint against him. When he \nreturned, he learned that a warrant for his arrest had been issued for failure to appear in \ncourt. In September 2002, he was convicted of the assault and battery as well as the \nfailure to appear. He was fined and placed on probation for 12 months (GX 13). \n \n \nIn November 2006, Applicant and his wife filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. \nThey made payments of $887 per month from December 2006 to April 2007. They \nmade no further payments and the bankruptcy was dismissed in May 2007 (GX 10). \nApplicant told a security investigator that his financial problems began when he and his \nspouse purchased a home they could not afford (GX 9 at 6). \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his security clearance application in February 2007, \nhe answered \u201cyes\u201d to question 23a, asking if he had ever been charged with or \n\n \n3\nconvicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs. He disclosed his DUI conviction in \na civilian court, but he did not disclose his Navy nonjudicial punishment for drunk driving \nand being drunk on duty. In response to question 23f, asking if in the last seven years \nhe had been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offenses not covered by \nother questions, he answered \u201cno\u201d and did not disclose his convictions of assault and \nbattery and failure to appear. He answered \u201cno\u201d to four questions about his financial \nrecord. He did not disclose his bankruptcy petition in November 2006, an automobile \nrepossession in 2006, and numerous delinquent debts, including one debt that was \nreduced to judgment.  \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories on December 20, 2008 (GX 8), Applicant \nstated he did not disclose his bankruptcy because he misunderstood the question and \nthought the seven-year period ran \u201cfrom the date I was filling out the paperwork.\u201d In an \naffidavit dated July 14, 2008, he stated he did not disclose the bankruptcy and other \ndelinquent debts because he was in the process of dismissing his bankruptcy petition \nand not sure of the status of his financial obligations (GX 9 at 7). He did not explain his \nother omissions from his application. \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is an automobile repossession. In his July 2008 \naffidavit, Applicant stated his wife purchased the auto in 2005 and it was repossessed \nwhile she was deployed at sea (GX 9 at 5). Applicant\u2019s credit bureau report (CBR) dated \nMarch 8, 2007, reflected past due payments but did not reflect a repossession (GX 7 at \n9). His CBR dated March 12, 2008 reflected an auto loan included in Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy (GX 6 at 3). His CBR dated June 18 2008 reflected that the debt was \nincluded in his Chapter 13 bankruptcy (GX 5 at 4). In his July 2008 affidavit, Applicant \nstated his wife told him the debt was paid, but he submitted no documentation of \npayments. \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c is for furniture. Applicant\u2019s March 2007 CBR and \nMarch 2008 CBR reflected he was making regular payments on the debt under his \nChapter 13 bankruptcy (GX 6 at 3; GX 7 at 6). His June 2008 CBR reflected an unpaid \njudgment for the debt awarded to a collection agent for the furniture store, alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.i (GX 5 at 3). In his July 2008 affidavit, Applicant stated he was aware of the \ndelinquent debt but not aware of the judgment, and he was making payments of $100 \non the debt (GX 9 at 5). He submitted no documentation of the payments.  \n \n \nThe credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is reflected in the March 2007 CBR as \nincluded in the bankruptcy (GX 7 at 6), It is not reflected in the March 2008 CBR, but it \nis reflected as charged off in the June 2008 CBR (GX 5 at 5). \n \n \nThe telephone bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e is reflected as delinquent on all three \nCBRs (GX 5 at 5; GX 6 at 2; GX 7 at 4). In his July 2008 affidavit, Applicant stated the \ndebt was paid, but he submitted no documentation of payment (GX 9 at 5). \n \n \nThe delinquent electric service bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f is reflected on the June \n2008 CBR, and it is reflected as an unpaid collection item in the March 2008 CBR (GX 6 \n\n \n4\nat 1; GX 5 at 9). In his July 2008 affidavit, Applicant stated the debt was delinquent at \none time but had been paid in full (GX 9 at 5-6). He submitted no documentation of \npayment. \n \n \nThe delinquent cable service bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g appears on the June 2008 \nCBR as assigned to collection, and it appears on the March 2008 CBR as a paid \ncollection account with a zero balance (GX 5 at 9; GX 6 at 1). In his affidavit, Applicant \nstated he believed the account had been paid (GX 9 at 6). \n \nApplicant admitted the delinquent cable service bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h in his \nJuly 2008 affidavit. He stated he had forgotten about it and intended to pay it (GX 9 at \n6). He has submitted no evidence of payment.  \n \n \nThe unpaid judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i is based on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.c. As noted above, Applicant stated he was making payments on the debt, but he \nsubmitted no evidence of payment. \n \n \nThe collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j is for the cable bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.g. It is reflected as \u201cfrozen\u201d with a zero balance (GX 5 at 10). \n \n \nThe collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k does not appear on the June 2008 \nor March 2008 CBRs, but it appears on the March 2007 as a past due collection \naccount (GX 7 at 7). Applicant did not address this debt in his July 2008 affidavit, but he \nadmitted it in his answer to the SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s June 2008 CBR and March 2007 CBR reflect that the account \ninformation was disputed for the two cable bills alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h (GX 5 at \n10; GX 7 at 10). The record does not reflect the basis for the disputes or their resolution. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \n\n \n5\nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition that was dismissed (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a) and ten delinquent debts totaling about $20,396 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1,b-1.k). The concern \nunder this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n6\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nThree potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG \u00b6 \n19(a) is raised where there is an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c) \nis raised when there is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(e) is \nraised when there is \u201cconsistent spending beyond one=s means, which may be indicated \nby excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, \nand/or other financial analysis.\u201d All three conditions are raised by Applicant\u2019s financial \nhistory, shifting the burden to him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n \nThe evidence reflects that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.i are based on the same debt, as \nare SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.j. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the \nsame guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant=s \nfavor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged \ntwice). Accordingly, I will resolve SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). This mitigating \ncondition is not established because Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \ndid not arise under unusual circumstances, and cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u2018the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established. This mitigating condition is not \nestablished because the debts arose because Applicant and his spouse were living \nbeyond their means and not from circumstances beyond his control. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is not established because there is no evidence Applicant has \nsought or received financial counseling and his financial situation is not under control. \n \n\n \n7\n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Applicant\u2019s CBRs show that the delinquent \ncable bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g was paid. He claimed to have paid the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, and 1.g, but he submitted no documentary evidence of payment. He \nclaimed he was making payments on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, but he produced no \ndocumentary evidence of payment. He produced no evidence of payments or a \npayment plan for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.h, and 1.k. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is \nestablished for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, but not for the other debts. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \ndisputed the two cable bills alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h, but he presented no \nevidence of the basis for the dispute. In his July 2008 affidavit, he admitted the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h and promised to pay it. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(e) is not established.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Activity \n \n \nThe SOR alleges two disciplinary proceedings against Applicant while he was in \nthe Navy (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.c) and three civilian convictions (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.d, and 2.e). \nIt also cross-alleges as criminal conduct the falsifications alleged under Guideline E \n(SOR \u00b6 2.f). Applicant admitted all the allegations. \n \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is that it \u201ccreates doubt about a person's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a \nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 30. \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include \u201ca single \nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d and \u201callegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, \nor convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). \n \n \nIt is a felony, punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than five years, \nor both, to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent \nstatement or representation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch \nof the government of the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Security clearances are \nmatters within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the government of the United \nStates. A deliberately false answer on a security clearance application is a serious \ncrime within the meaning of Guideline J.  \n \nApplicant offered no explanation or excuse for his failure to fully disclose his \nrecord of criminal conduct. His explanation for not disclosing his bankruptcy is \nimplausible and not credible. He offered no explanation for not disclosing the \n\n \n8\nautomobile repossession. It appears he may have been unaware of the judgment \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i, and he may have forgotten about the $59 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.h, but he offered no plausible or credible explanation for not disclosing the other \ndelinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s record of criminal conduct and his failure to disclose the \nfull extent of his criminal conduct and financial delinquencies in his security clearance \napplication raise the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c), shifting the burden \nto him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). The first clause of \nAG \u00b6 32(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed\u201d) focuses on whether the criminal conduct was \nrecent. There are no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@  The \ndetermination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence.  \nISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows Aa \nsignificant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ then an \nadministrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates Achanged \ncircumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s misconduct while in the Navy is arguably not \u201crecent,\u201d but his pattern \nof misconduct continued in May 2000, and it culminated in his falsification of his security \nclearance application in February 2007. I conclude AG \u00b6 32(a) is not established \nbecause his criminal conduct was recent and did not arise under unusual \ncircumstances. \n \n \nCriminal conduct also may be mitigated if \u201cthere is evidence of successful \nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of \ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good \nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(d). This \nmitigating condition is not established because Applicant\u2019s recent falsifications negate a \nfinding of \u201csuccessful rehabilitation.\u201d \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant was discharged from the Navy under Other than \nHonorable Conditions (SOR \u00b6 3.a), deliberately failed to fully disclose his criminal \nrecord (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b and 3.c), and deliberately failed to disclose his record of financial \ndelinquencies (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.d-3.g)1. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 \nas follows: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of \nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security \n                                                          \n1 SOR \u00b6 3.g alleges Applicant deliberately failed to disclose the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.d and \n1.l. There is no subparagraph1.l in the SOR, but Applicant\u2019s deliberate failure to disclose the debt in \nsubparagraph 1.d is sufficient to raise a security concern. \n\n \n9\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition applicable to Applicant\u2019s discharge from the \nNavy is AG \u00b6 16(d): \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating \nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information.\u201d This disqualifying \ncondition encompasses \u201ca pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(d)(3). \nApplicant\u2019s multiple violations of the UCMJ and his civilian DUI conviction while in the \nNavy, all of which formed the basis for his discharge, are sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 \n16(d)(3).  \n \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition applicable to Applicant\u2019s omissions of \ninformation from his security clearance application is \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, \nor falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal \nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of \nproving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s state of mind \nwhen the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence \nas a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning \nan applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nApplicant wrote \u201cI admit\u201d after each Guideline E allegation in the SOR, but his \nresponses to interrogatories and his July 2008 affidavit strongly suggest he was \nadmitting he entered the answers as alleged, but he was not admitting he intentionally \ngave false answers. Accordingly, I have treated the allegations of falsification as \ncontroverted.  \n \n \nApplicant was aware of the disciplinary infractions underlying his unfavorable \ndischarge from the Navy, but he omitted them from his security clearance application. \nHe has given no explanations for the omissions. As noted above in the discussion of \nGuideline J, he was aware of most of his financial delinquencies, but gave no plausible \nor credible explanation for not disclosing them. Based on this record, I conclude AG \u00b6 \n16(a) is raised. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). This mitigating condition is not established because Applicant \nmade no effort to correct the omissions from his application until he was confronted with \nthe evidence. \n\n \n10\n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is \nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). Applicant\u2019s \nomissions were not minor. They were recent, numerous, and did not occur under unique \ncircumstances. They cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns based on personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe \nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e). Applicant eventually made full disclosure of his \ndisciplinary and financial record in his July 2008 affidavit. Thus, he receives some credit \nunder AG \u00b6 17(e). \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F, J, and E in my whole person analysis. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F, J, and E, and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns based on financial considerations, criminal conduct, and personal \nconduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n11\nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.j: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.g: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.
