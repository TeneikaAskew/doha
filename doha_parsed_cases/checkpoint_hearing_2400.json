    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant partially admitted the allegations in the SOR with explanations. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 41 years old. He attended college, but did not graduate. He never married and has no children. Applicant worked for a federal contractor from 2000 to 2004 and again from 2008 to the present. He took four months off to care for his mother in 2012. He was granted a secret security clearance in 2015 and later an interim top secret security clearance that was withdrawn in February 2020. He believed he held a public trust position from 2000 to 2004, while working as a contractor for a federal agency. (Transcript (Tr.) 10-12, 21-22, 39-40) In 1999, while a high school student, Applicant was stopped by the police and his car was searched. The police found a marijuana pipe. Applicant testified he could not recall the specifics of the incident. He stated that the pipe belonged to his friend. Applicant was charged with possession of drug paraphernalia. Applicant testified he served community service and the charge was dismissed. He stated that the arrest had an impact on him, and he became careful about having people in his car. He stated his failure to disclose this arrest and charge on his May 2016 security clearance application (SCA) was due to an oversight. (Tr. 23, 30-31, 34, 37, 46-48; GE 1, 2, 5) Applic",

There were no objections and all exhibits \nwere admitted into evidence. DOHA received the hearing transcript on May 20, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant partially admitted the allegations in the SOR with explanations. His \nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 41 years old. He attended college, but did not graduate. He never \nmarried and has no children. Applicant worked for a federal contractor from 2000 to 2004 \nand again from 2008 to the present. He took four months off to care for his mother in \n2012. He was granted a secret security clearance in 2015 and later an interim top secret \nsecurity clearance that was withdrawn in February 2020. He believed he held a public \ntrust position from 2000 to 2004, while working as a contractor for a federal agency. \n(Transcript (Tr.) 10-12, 21-22, 39-40) \nIn 1999, while a high school student, Applicant was stopped by the police and his \ncar was searched. The police found a marijuana pipe. Applicant testified he could not \nrecall the specifics of the incident. He stated that the pipe belonged to his friend. Applicant \nwas charged with possession of drug paraphernalia. Applicant testified he served \ncommunity service and the charge was dismissed. He stated that the arrest had an impact \non him, and he became careful about having people in his car. He stated his failure to \ndisclose this arrest and charge on his May 2016 security clearance application (SCA) was \ndue to an oversight. (Tr. 23, 30-31, 34, 37, 46-48; GE 1, 2, 5) \nApplicant completed an SCA in 2011. In it, Applicant disclosed that he used \nmarijuana from February 2010 to April 2010, a couple of times during social situations. \nHe testified that he was offered marijuana by others and used it at concerts and social \ngatherings. He would use marijuana about once a month. (Tr. 23, 36; GE 1) \nApplicant testified that he used marijuana beginning in 1999. He was using \nmarijuana while holding a public trust position from 2000 to 2004. Applicant repeatedly \ntestified that he did not want to misrepresent himself on the frequency of his marijuana \nuse because it was a long time ago. He acknowledged that from 2002 to 2008 he likely \nused marijuana on average once a month. He used marijuana in 2010 and continued \nusing it and increased his use in 2012 to about two to three weekends a month. He was \ncaring for his sick mother and had taken time off from his job from January 2012 to June \n2012. This was a stressful time for him. Because he was at home more, he used \nmarijuana more often. He stated he was using it more by himself than with others. He \noccasionally purchased it. He would find the seller through a friend. He would then \npurchase a small amount. He also often acquired it from friends. (Tr. 24, 33-35, 39-46, \n51-57, 70-72) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose his more extensive drug use in his 2011 SCA because \nhe made a mistake and did not want to misrepresent himself. He decided when it came \ntime he would explain it in person during his investigation interview. He testified that he \ndid not recall meeting with an investigator after he completed his 2011 SCA. His failure \nto disclose his more extensive marijuana use on his 2011 SCA was not alleged in the \nSOR. He denied being aware that he was denied a security clearance in 2011 because \nof his drug use.1 (Tr. 24, 33-35, 39-46, 51-64) \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from 1999 to October 2016. After \ncompleting his May 2016 SCA and being granted a security clearance, Applicant used \nmarijuana in October 2016. He did not disclose any of his past marijuana use on his May \n2016 SCA. His explanation was he had been employed by the federal government since \n2000, and this was the first time he was to meet with an investigator. He decided he \nwanted to tell the investigator face to face about his past drug use. Applicant explained \nhis October 2016 use of marijuana was at a concert with friends. He explained his failure \nto disclose his drug charge was an oversight and unintentional. (Tr. 23-24, 29, 46, 49\n \n, 59- \n64, 70-74) \nApplicant further testified that he did not disclose his marijuana use on his 2016 \nSCA because he was nervous and was using it socially. He stated \u201cit was a mistake to \nput that falsified information on there. There is really nothing else I can say about it.\u201d (Tr. \n27) He said when questioned by the government investigator he disclosed it. His personal \nsubject interview with the investigator was not included as evidence to corroborate his \nstatement. He further explained that he felt if he disclosed his drug use in his SCA that it \nwould not portray him in a way that best represented him. He testified that he was aware \nthat he was required to provide honest answers on his SCA and that he signed it attesting \nto its accuracy. He said it was always his intention to tell the investigator of his prior drug \nuse, and he did not i ntentionally fail to disclose this information or lie on his SCA. He said \nhe knew the subject would come up in his background investigation. Applicant testified \nthat he could not justify why he did not disclose his past drug use. He said he was nervous \nabout disclosing it, but did not intentionally withhold it despite him stating \u201cno\u201d on his SCA \nregarding past drug use. The last page of Applicant\u2019s 2016 SCA allows for additional \ncomments to be included. Applicant made comments in this section about certain \nquestions on his SCA. It did not include any comments about wanting to explain to an \ninvestigator about his drug use. (GE 2; Tr. 27, 70-77) \nApplicant testified that he considers himself honest and trustworthy. In the future, \nhe will provide honest answers. He has learned from his past mistakes and that he must \nbe honest and forthcoming. He testified that his marijuana use was during his youth. At \nthe time of his last marijuana use he was 34 years old. He stated that he matured slower \nthan others. He admitted he used marijuana as a coping mechanism and to help with \nstress. He also stated using it during social gatherings and concerts was a form of stress \n1 Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered for disqualifying \npurposes, but may be considered when making a cred bility determination, in the application of mitigating \nconditions, and in a whole-person analysis. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmanagement and because he does not drink alcohol, using marijuana is his way of \ncelebrating. (Tr. 28, 64-70) \nI did not find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible when he stated that he did not \ndeliberately fail to disclose his prior drug use and drug charge on his 2016 SCA because \nhe wanted to discuss his drug usage with an investigator. I find he deliberately failed to \ndisclose the requested information on his SCA. I find his explanation that it was an \noversight that he did not disclose his 1999 drug arrest as plausible, and he did not \ndeliberately fail to disclose the arrest. \nApplicant testified that he could not recall what he told a government investigator, \nbut if he did tell the government investigator that he used marijuana from 2000 to 2002 at \nleast once a week and on the weekends then it was probably true. He was working for a \nfederal agency at this time. He believed that he held a public trust position. \nApplicant testified that he is aware that federal contractors have an anti-drug policy \nrequiring their employees to be drug-free. He was aware he was on notice through the \n2011 and 2016 SCAs that use of illegal drugs was inconsistent with federal employment. \nHe has not used marijuana since October 2016 and does not intend to use it again. He \nstated he no longer lives close to associates he previously used drugs with. (Tr. 24, 50- \n51) \nApplicant testified that he takes full responsibility for his actions and understands \nthe Government\u2019s security concerns. He provided evidence to show he has taken two \ndrug tests that were negative. He also provided a statement of intent not to use illegal \ndrugs in the future, and copies of his performance evaluations that reflect he has been \nconsistently an outstanding performer. (Tr. 22, 25-26; AE A through I) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or \n \n psychological i\n mpairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacturing, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant was arrested and charged in 1999 with possession of drug \nparaphernalia. He used marijuana with varying frequency from 1999 to October 2016. He \nheld a security clearance when he used marijuana in October 2016 holding it. The above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The \nfollowing mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about 1999 to 2016, often in \nsocial settings, but also when he was alone to cope with stress. His last use of marijuana \nwas in October 2016. He stated he does not intend to use marijuana in the future, and he \nhas moved away from associates with whom he used it. He signed a statement of intent \nto abstain from future use. His last use was almost six years ago. I believe that it is unlikely \nthat Applicant will use marijuana in the future. Both AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) apply. \nHowever, they are insufficient to mitigate the security concern raised by Applicant using \nmarijuana after he held a security clearance. He was on notice in 2011, when he \ncompleted his SCA that illegal drug use was inconsistent with holding a security \nclearance. He was aware that federal agencies and contractors have an anti-drug use \npolicy. He chose to use marijuana while working for these employers and after he was \ngranted a security clearance. He had an opportunity to cease his drug use after he was \nagain put on notice when he completed his May 2016 SCA, but months later violated that \ntrust. Applicant failed to mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcern. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant failed to disclose on his May 2016 SCA that he was arrested and charged \nwith possession of drug paraphernalia in 1999. He testified that his omission was due to \noversight. I find that explanation to be plausible and find he did not deliberately fail to \ndisclose this charge. I find partially in his favor on SOR \u00b6 2.a. However, the evidence is \nsufficient to conclude that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose on his SCA his past \nmarijuana use, the second part of SOR \u00b6 2.a. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or otherwise inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is \nunlikely to recur. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n-\nApplicant testified that he did not disclose his past drug use on his SCA because \nhe wanted to discuss it with an investigator, which he could also have done regardless of \nwhether he disclosed it on his SCA. That statement acknowledges that he made a \ndeliberate decision to not disclose it, despite his justification for why he did not disclose \nit. Applicant testified that when he completed his 2011 SCA, he anticipated having an \nopportunity to talk to an investigator, but it never happened. The government relies on \nthose it grants security clearances to be forthcoming with information. In this instance the \ngovernment was never put on notice that there were potential issues. That is the \nresponsibility of the Applicant. In the additional comments section of his 2016 SCA, he \nmade comments about a different question. He could have easily made a similar \ncomment, alerting the investigator that he had issues he wanted to discuss about his drug \nuse. He did not. Deliberately failing to disclose required information is not a minor offense. \nThe crux of being granted a security clearance is trust and honesty. Providing honest \nanswers when asked is a requirement. Applicant failed to meet that standard. There is \ninsufficient evidence that he made a prompt effort to correct his omissions. The above \nmitigating conditions do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis \nAlthough there is some evidence of mitigation regarding Applicant\u2019s drug use, it is \ninsufficient to mitigate the security concerns based on his use after being granted a \nsecurity clearance and his deliberate failure to disclose his past drug use on his SCA. The \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph  1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant2 \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets \nas well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes the following disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations;\u201d \u201c(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s \nmeans or frivolous or irresponsible spending, which may be indicated by excessive \nindebtedness, significant negative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-\npayment, or other negative financial indicators;\u201d and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently \nfiling annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax as required.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying\nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), 19(e), and 19(f). Further inquiry is necessary about the\npotential application of any mitigating conditions. \n \n \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue;  \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \n[full cite here] Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of \nthe national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. His debt \nremains a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence.

Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-\n03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)).  \nAG \u00b6 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20g) are partially applicable as it pertains to his \ndelinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s 2013 $12,000 reduction in income from $67,000 to \n$55,000 no doubt played a role in his ability to remain current on his established \nobligations at that time. However, such a loss of income does not correlate to the \namount of debt he subsequently incurred. He does not receive full credit under these \nmitigating conditions because the debts he incurred were inconsistent with his ability to \nrepay his creditors, his overall failure to act responsibly under the circumstances, \nespecially with regard to his taxes, and the length of time that has elapsed since \nincurring these debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) is not applicable. \nOf significant concern is the fact that Applicant did not timely pay his Federal \nincomes taxes from 2010 to 2020, and did not timely pay his state income taxes from \n2016 to 2020. As the record indicates, he never paid the required amount of the taxes \ndue for the years indicated when they were due. He consistently failed to maintain \nsufficient Federal and state withholdings and/or maintain sufficient funds on hand to pay \nhis Federal and state taxes. He explained that he did not increase his withholdings in \norder to repay his other creditors. At his hearing, he stated that he was going to \nliquidate company stock from a previous employer and use those funds to pay off his \ntaxes. He did not produce any post-hearing evidence from the close of his hearing on \nSeptember 8, 2021, until the record closed on December 15, 2021. Addressing his tax \narrearage would have provided significant mitigating evidence. \nApplicant was alerted to the fact that his failure to pay his taxes and his \nindebtedness were a concern to the Government during his June 13, 2010 OPM PSI \nand later when he received his October 13, 2020 SOR. He has been actively making \nefforts to resolve his debts, and deserves appropriate credit for that, particularly as he \nwas proactive before his SOR was issued. He had retained the services of two credit \ncounseling services and paid off some debts and paid down some debts. \nOn the other hand, Applicant claimed his current situation came about when his \nincome dropped by approximately $12,000, and yet somehow from a $12,000 income \nloss, he incurred altogether almost $100,000 in delinquent debt. He appears to have \nhad some serious judgment lapses when it came to managing his finances. In addition \nto his long-standing Federal and state tax arrearages, ten SOR accounts remain \nunresolved. With so much outstanding debt, and absent additional post-hearing \nevidence, lingering doubts about Applicant\u2019s security eligibility remain. \nWhile the following case is primarily directed to the timely filing of tax returns, the \nimportance the Appeal Board places on fulfilling one\u2019s legal obligations in instructive. \nSuch repeated failures to fulfill those obligations do not demonstrate the high degree of \ngood judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nThis is particularly pertinent as it pertains to tax matters. The DOHA Appeal Board has \ncommented in ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016): \n11 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. \n886 (1961). (emphasis in original) \nSee ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted); \nISCR Case No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-\n05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. \n18, 2015).   \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant or continue national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the \nAnalysis section under Guideline F is incorporated in this whole-person section. \nHowever, further comments are warranted. \nTo review, Applicant is a 52-year-old database administrator, who has been \nemployed by a defense contractor since April 2021. He honorably served 20 years of \nactive duty in the Navy, and has spent his post-Navy years working for defense \ncontractors. He has successfully held a clearance for 31 years. He seeks to retain his \n12 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \nsecurity clearance as a requirement of his continued employment. He is highly regarded \nand respected by his employer and peers. \nHowever, for at least 12 years, he has failed to grasp the importance of one of \nthe fundamental hallmarks of U.S. citizenship, which is timely paying his Federal and \nstate income taxes when due. This is especially crucial for an individual seeking to \nretain a security clearance and working for a defense contractor advancing the national \nsecurity of the United States. Having successfully held a clearance for 31 years, the \nimportance of timely paying his taxes and maintaining financial responsibility should \nhave been well known to Applicant. \nFrom the evidence presented, Applicant\u2019s history of continually accruing \ndelinquent tax debt for years is particularly concerning. Accruing significant additional \nconsumer debt is equally concerning. That said, Applicant appears to have seen the \nerror of his ways and has taken significant corrective action. It is unknown what \nadditional progress Applicant would have made had he submitted post-hearing \nevidence. \nApplicant is a bright and talented individual, who is more than capable of \naddressing his income tax and indebtedness problems in a responsible way. This \ndecision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not \nattain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. With \nmore effort towards establishing a track record of financial responsibility, and a better \ntrack record of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able to \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k \u2013 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.m \u2013 1.n: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.o \u2013 1.p: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.q \u2013 1.r: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.s \u2013 1.v: \nFor Applicant \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \n \n \n \n \n \n     Subparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.f: \n \n \n \n \n     Subparagraphs 1.g \u2013 1.j: \n \n \n                           \n \n \n \n                \n \n \n                           \n \n \n                           \n \n \n                           \n \n \n                           Subparagraphs 1.w \u2013 1.x: \n \n \n \n \n      Subparagraphs 1.y \u2013 1.z: \n \n  \n \n13 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 24, 2020, in accordance with Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, as amended (Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline F. (Item 1) \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June \n8, 2017.

Applicant received the FORM December 11, 2021. Applicant did \nnot object to the Government\u2019s evidence, and he provided a response to the FORM (Item \n10).

(Item 2) Applicant, age 34, filed \nfor divorce in 2015, but the divorce was finalized in 2016 or 2018. He had no children \nfrom the marriage. (Item 3) Applicant remarried in 2018, and his wife had three teenagers. \nHe served in the U.S. Air Force from July 2006 to October 2016. He serves in the Air \nNational Guard (active reserve) from October 2016 to the present. He attended college \nclasses from 2008 under the GI bill at various universities to earn an undergraduate \ndegree in computer science. He worked full time and studied at night. (Item 9) He is \ncurrently a police officer and is sponsored by a company for a security clearance. \nApplicant completed his security clearance application on April 16, 2018. (Item 3) The \nrecord did not reflect that he had a security clearance. (Item 1) He is being sponsored for \na security clearance with his current employer. It is not clear from the record how long \nApplicant has been employed with them. (Item 3) \nFINANCIAL \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has eight delinquent debts totaling $121,381, \nincluding a mortgage, commercial accounts, cell account, credit union loans, insurance, \nand a medical account. (Item 1) \nApplicant attributes his financial situation to his divorce. (Item 10) He also stated \nthat the divorce was in 2018. While it was amicable, there were unresolved financial \nissues. Applicant and his wife lived in a house with a current mortgage. Applicant moved \nout of the house and his wife stated that she would stay. However, she neglected to pay \nthe mortgage. Eventually, she decided to take their son and move out of the country. \nApplicant moved back into the house and used his entire savings to pay the mortgage, \nwhich was six months overdue in the amount of $12,000. His wife also left a shared \nvehicle unpaid that was repossessed. The credit accounts and the phone account were \nunpaid. (Item 10) \nAs to SOR allegation \u00b6 1.a, a mortgage account that was past due in the amount \nof approximately $35,618, with a total loan balance of $377,447, Applicant closed the \nmortgage by a short sale and avoided foreclosure. (Item 10 and Item 8). The 2021 credit \nreport shows that the mortgage account is reflected as paid and closed. (Item 8) \nAs to SOR allegation \u00b6 1.b, a charged-off account in the amount of $58,320 to a \ncredit account, Applicant\u2019s 2021 credit bureau shows that he has been paying monthly \nsince 2018 and the most recent payment was August 2021. The other same credit \naccount shows that Applicant has a zero balance.

This appears to be the car loan and the \nlast payment was in 2019. (Item 8) The charge-off amount is still $10,021. (Item 8) \nHowever, Applicant submitted a document that stated it was a \u201cprofit and loss write-off\u201d \nas it was totaled during a hailstorm. The credit report also shows a zero amount for past-\ndue. (Item 8) \nAs to SOR allegation 1.d, a cell phone account in the amount of $3,182, Applicant \ndenied the debt because it was his wife\u2019s phone. However, in response to the FORM, he \nsubmitted a document that shows that he paid the amount and it is in good standing. (Item \n10) \nAs to SOR allegation 1.e, a credit card account charged-off for $1,893, Applicant \nsettled the account for $780 and the document shows the debt is covered. also states \nthat the account is closed and in good standing. (Item 10) \nAs to the SOR \u00b6 1.f the SOR alleged that Applicant is indebted for a medical \naccount in the amount of $649. He denies this allegation, but provided no information. \nAs to the SOR \u00b6 1.g, the SOR alleged that Applicant was indebted for a collection \naccount in the approximate account of $240 to an insurance company. He admitted the \ndebt and provided no information. \nAs to the SOR \u00b6 1.h, the SOR alleges that Applicant has a charged-off account in \nthe approximate amount of $11,245. He denied this allegation in his answer to the SOR. \nHe provided documentation that he is settling the credit card account, which was his wife\u2019s \naccount, but he has not begun the payments. (Item 10) \nApplicant admitted in his interview in 2019 that his finances were strained, but he \nwas progressing with a new job. He is budgeting his money, his larger debts are satisfied \nor in the process of being resolved. He has been taking action to ameliorate the delinquent \ndebts due to the divorce. He received financial counseling and his earlier credit reports \nfrom 2018 and 2019 show the great majority of accounts as \u201cpays as agreed.\u201d (Item 4) \nApplicant was making a transition from the military to civilian life during the time of \nthe divorce. He had travelled to many stations while his wife was home and responsible \nfor bills. He had a pay cut when he transferred from active duty to reserves. The divorce \nand the transition into a new and stressful career in law enforcement took a toll. He \nworked midnights as a police officer for almost three years while also attending drill and \ntraining for national guard. He stated that he also called several creditors that were joint \naccounts to have his name removed but that was not possible. \nApplicant has paid, settled or is in the process of resolving 90% of his delinquent \ndebts. He has resolved AG \u00b6 1.a through 1.e. He has presented sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the financial consideration concerns. He is working on a plan. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO \n10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues began with his divorce. The record is not clear whether \nthe divorce was in 2016 or 2018. Applicant had a good record of paying his bills prior to \nthe divorce as shown by his earlier credit reports. The divorce and lack of cooperation \nfrom his wife caused both the mortgage and her credit cards to not be paid. Applicant \ntransitioned from the active military to reserves in 2016 and had a decrease in pay. \nDespite that he paid his larger debts and called creditors. He is in the process of making \nplans to pay the others. He received financial counseling, has a budget, and a stable job. \nHe worked at nights to improve his salary and managed to attend college classes. AG \u00b6 \n20(a) through 20(d) are established. \nApplicant served his country for many years. He left active duty and served in the \nreserves.. While he was away on duty, his former wife neglected to pay the mortgage. He \nmarried for a second time and takes care of his current wife and her three teens. He has \nmade substantial efforts to resolve his delinquent debts. For these reasons, I find SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through h. for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and Applicant\u2019s military service and devotion to \nhis country, I conclude that Applicant has presented sufficient mitigation. He was \npresented with a divorce situation and transition to civilian life with many debts and he did \nnot ignore them. Accordingly, Applicant has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the sole SOR allegation. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 59 years old. She married in 1983 and divorced in 1995. She has two adult children from the marriage. She remarried in 1998 and has an adult child from the marriage. She has worked for a federal contractor since 1999 and held a security clearance since 2006. In her December 2017 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed that she failed to timely file her 2015 and 2016 federal and state income tax returns. She stated in the SCA: \u201cHad brain tumor/surgery in February 2017, returned to work Oct 2017, working on filing.\u201d She also stated: \u201cSpoke with IRS, will complete NLT December 2017, most likely a refund.\u201d (Item 3) Applicant responded to government interrogatories in April 2019. She provided IRS transcripts for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017. Her 2015 federal income tax return was filed in July 2018; 2016 federal income tax return filed in April 2019; and 2017 federal income tax return filed in April 2019. She was entitled to refunds each year and there is no balance owed for these years.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 20, 2020, the Defense Counter intelligence and Security Agency issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 10, 2020, and June 18, 2021, and elected \nto have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel \nsubmitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it \non August 31, 2021. She was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. \nThe Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 2 through 5. (Item 1 is the SOR.) \nApplicant did not provide a response to the FORM, object to the Government\u2019s evidence, \nor submit documents. The case was assigned to me on November 4, 2021. After \nreviewing the FORM, based on Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, I asked Department \nCounsel to contact Applicant to clarify whether she submitted additional documents with \nher answer. After several email correspondences, which are attached as Hearing Exhibits \nI and II, I permitted Applicant to submit an additional document, which is marked as \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) A. The record closed on February 25, 2022.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the sole SOR allegation. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 59 years old. She married in 1983 and divorced in 1995. She has two \nadult children from the marriage. She remarried in 1998 and has an adult child from the \nmarriage. She has worked for a federal contractor since 1999 and held a security \nclearance since 2006. \nIn her December 2017 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed \nthat she failed to timely file her 2015 and 2016 federal and state income tax returns. She \nstated in the SCA: \u201cHad brain tumor/surgery in February 2017, returned to work Oct 2017, \nworking on filing.\u201d She also stated: \u201cSpoke with IRS, will complete NLT December 2017, \nmost likely a refund.\u201d (Item 3) \nApplicant responded to government interrogatories in April 2019. She provided IRS \ntranscripts for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017. Her 2015 federal income tax return was \nfiled in July 2018; 2016 federal income tax return filed in April 2019; and 2017 federal \nincome tax return filed in April 2019. She was entitled to refunds each year and there is \nno balance owed for these years. (Item 4) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s July 2018 background interview with a government investigator, \nshe explained that she failed to timely file her income tax returns because she had a brain \ntumor that eventually led to brain surgery in February 2017. Her condition made her tired. \nShe was aware she would be receiving a tax refund so she was lazy about timely filing \nthe returns. (Item 5) \nIn Applicant\u2019s June 2020 answer to the SOR she stated: \nMy sincere apologies for not taking care of this sooner. I thought I remedied \nthis issue last year, but this action has made me aware that the problem still \nexists. I immediately made copies of my State taxes, and resent it by mail. \nI understand the importance of having my security clearance, and how not \nhaving it will affect my job and lively hood (sic). Please be assured, that I \nwill not let this happen in the future.

After I reopened the record, she provided a \ndocument from her state substantiating a zero balance owed as of December 2020. \nAlthough this document does not specifically address tax years 2015 to 2017, I found \nApplicant\u2019s statement credible and believe she resent the required tax documents to her \nstate. I am satisfied that she is current on her state taxes. (AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following is \npotentially applicable: \n(g) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file her federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2015, 2016, and 2017. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying condition. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nApplicant experienced serious medical issues that required brain surgery in \nFebruary 2017. She stated this condition caused her to be fatigued. She admitted that \nshe was subsequently lazy in not following through on her tax filings because she knew \nshe was entitled to refunds. Her tax transcripts confirm that she filed her federal income \ntaxes, albeit late, and was entitled to refunds. I considered Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR \nindicating she resent her state income tax returns and the document she provided \nindicating she had a zero balance owed to the state. I find that this behavior is unlikely \nrecur and does not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) initially applied due to Applicant\u2019s medical condition, however, her \nfailure to address her delinquent filings within a reasonable time negates the full \napplication of his mitigating condition. The evidence indicates that Applicant does not owe \nfederal or state income taxes. Based on her answer, it appears she believed she had filed \nher state income tax returns. When she was made aware that was not accurate, she said \nshe resent the tax returns to her state. I found her statement credible and although the \ndocument she provided does not clearly state the date on which she filed her state \nreturns, I am satisfied that they were filed and she does not owe state income taxes. I find \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant successfully mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline \nF, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On August 19, 2020, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA \nCAF) issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec.

Processing of the case was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On May \n3, 2022, the case was assigned to me. On June 17, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for July 11, 2022. \n(HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel offered four exhibits into evidence, and Applicant did not offer \nany exhibits into evidence at his hearing. (Tr. 12, 18-19; GE 1-GE 4) There were no \nobjections, and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 19) On August 5, \n2022, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing. The record was held open until August \n12, 2022, to enable Applicant to provide additional documentation. (Tr. 76, 81) Applicant \nprovided 28 post-hearing documents, which were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. (Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE BB) Some of Applicant\u2019s exhibits consisted of \nmultiple related documents. \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through \n1.f, and he denied the SOR allegation in \u00b6 1.a. (HE 3) His admissions are accepted as \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is a 44-year-old aircraft mechanic who has been employed by the same \nDOD contractor since 2015. (Tr. 6, 28) In 1996, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 7) He \nhas taken some college classes; however, he has not received a degree. (Tr. 7) He \nserved in the Air Force from 1996 to 2014, and he received early retirement as a technical \nsergeant (E-6) under the Government\u2019s Temporary Early Retirement Authority. (Tr. 7, 27) \nHe received monthly retirement pay and medical benefits. (Tr. 8) He has held a security \nclearance for seven years while working for a DOD contractor, and there are no \nallegations of security violations. (Tr. 28) His resume provides further details about his \nemployment. (AE Y) \nApplicant was married from October 1998 to June 2005. (Tr. 21; GE 1) He was \nmarried the second time from July 2009 to July 2010. (Tr. 21-22; GE 2) His two children \nare ages 20 and 21; they are married; and they do not live with him. (Tr. 9, 26) \nFinancial Considerations \nAs a result of his first divorce, Applicant had monthly child-support payment \nresponsibilities of $1,200, and he was required to pay about $900 monthly for a debt \nconsolidation loan he obtained to pay off marital debts and for other costs. (Tr. 32, 37; AE \nE at 6; AE BB) His first wife was dishonest about opening credit card accounts in \nApplicant\u2019s name while he was deployed. (Tr. 32) He eventually paid off the debt \nconsolidation loan. (Tr. 37) \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFrom March 2016 to February 2018, Applicant cohabitated with his girlfriend, who \nhad been medically discharged from the Air Force. (Tr. 22-23) She had mental-health \nissues, and she attempted suicide. (Tr. 23) She was unemployed. (Tr. 23) Applicant\u2019s \nfinances were harmed by his support for her. (Tr. 23) He did not detail how much he paid \nto assist her. \nThe August 19, 2020 SOR alleged six delinquent debts totaling $42,165 as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant\u2019s mortgage is past due in the amount of $24,443. On \nMarch 14, 2012, Applicant obtained a $185,423 mortgage with $46,355 repayment \nguaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). (Tr. 30-31; AE A; AE B) This \nmortgage enabled him to purchase a house near an Air Force Base where he was \nassigned. The home was newly constructed, and the development where it was located \nhad new homes under construction. (Tr. 36) In October 2014, the mortgage account was \none month late because of Applicant\u2019s support for his cohabitant, who was an inpatient \nat a military hospital at a distant location. (Tr. 34) In October 2014, Applicant retired from \nthe Air Force and moved out of the house. (Tr. 33) A friend moved into the house in \nOctober 2014, and his friend paid rent for several months. (Tr. 33-34) The $1,300 rent \nwas sufficient to pay the mortgage, insurance, and taxes. (Tr. 34) Applicant\u2019s tenant \nadvised him that he was having financial problems and could not pay the rent. (Tr. 36; AE \nN) Applicant was unable to sell the home because new homes were available at similar \nprices, and he could not compete with them. (Tr. 36-37)  \nIn August 2016, the creditor received a judgment for $202,226 for Applicant\u2019s \nresidence, and the deed for Applicant\u2019s property was transferred to the creditor. (Tr. 68; \nAE C) On August 3, 2022, the VA wrote Applicant a letter which stated: \nPlease be advised, the property which secured this loan was sold to the \nnoteholder at foreclosure sale on [in 2016] for $154,315.80. At the time of \nthe foreclosure sale, the total outstanding loan balance was $205,819.72.  \nThe proceeds from the foreclosure sale were applied to this balance, as well \nas a claim under loan guaranty from the Department of Veterans Affairs in \nthe amount of $46,805.00, but those payments were not sufficient to fully \npay the outstanding balance resulting in a deficiency balance of $4,698.92.  \nVA Regulation 38 CFR 36.4324(e) provides upon payment of a claim to the \nlender following termination of the account, VA, to the extent of guaranty\npaid, has the right to establish and collect this debt against you. However, \nbecause this was a Guaranteed Indemnity Fund Loan (GIF) that was \nestablished after December 1998, VA is not pursuing such collection. (AE\nR) \n \n \n \nOn April 29, 2019, the VA indicated the amount of VA loss was $45,931. (AE B) \nThe creditor refunded two months of insurance payments from Applicant\u2019s escrow \naccount to Applicant. (Tr. 38-39) Applicant\u2019s mortgage debt is resolved. (Tr. 39; AE M)\nHe is credited with mitigating this debt. \n \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn 2020, Applicant purchased another house in a different state. (Tr. 54) His current \nmortgage is $284,742, and the VA has guaranteed repayment. (Tr. 67; AE D) His monthly \npayment for mortgage, taxes, and insurance is $1,715; it is automatically paid from his \nbank account; and his mortgage account is current. (AE D) The mortgage company \nestimated his home value is $459,000; his equity is $174,258; and he could borrow an \nadditional $73,258. (AE D) His car loan is paid off. (Tr. 57) His annual net pay is $67,000. \n(Tr. 64) He has about $2,000 monthly remaining after all expenses are paid. (Tr. 62) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a charged-off credit-card debt for $8,174. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a \ncredit-card debt in collection for $7,158. SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a charged-off credit-card debt \nfor $1,466. Applicant used these three credit cards for the expenses of daily living, and \nhe admitted his responsibility for the three debts. (Tr. 42, 46, 48; SOR response) On \nOctober 4, 2018, he told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that he \nplanned to pay these three debts in 2019 or as soon as possible. (Tr. 44; GE 2 at 8-10) \nHowever, after he made this promise to the OPM investigator, he needed funds to assist \nhis mother and grandmother. (Tr. 44) He also moved twice after his OPM interview. (Tr. \n48-49, 54) He did not make any payments to address SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d after his \nOPM interview. He did not provide details about his financial assistance to his mother and \ngrandmother or the additional expenses from moving to different residences. \nApplicant currently has funds available to pay the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and \n1.d. He has a total of about $20,000 in his checking and savings accounts; however, he \ndid not believe it was a good idea to pay these three debts before he knew the \nramifications of paying them on his pending security clearance disposition. (Tr. 43, 46-\n47, 63; AE L) If he used his available funds to pay his SOR debts, and he lost his security \nclearance and employment, he would be in a financial hardship because the funds \nexpended would be unavailable while he was unemployed. (Tr. 43, 46, 71) After his \nhearing, he indicated in an email that he would pay the three delinquent debts if his \nsecurity clearance is not revoked with the funds that were already available to settle the \nthree debts. (AE J; AE L)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges an account placed for collection for $151. Applicant owed this \ndebt for Internet services for about seven years. (Tr. 50-51) He paid this debt on June 14, \n2022. (Tr. 52) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a utility account placed for collection for $773. Applicant admitted \nresponsibility for this debt; it was delinquent for about six years; and he paid it on July 8, \n2022. (Tr. 53; AE X) \nApplicant has not received formal financial counseling. (Tr. 55) He has received \nfinancial advice over the years on an ad hoc basis. (Tr. 55) On August 1, 2022, his credit \nscores from the three primary credit reporting companies were 690, 705, and 712. (AE K) \nHe has $45,445 in his 401(k) account.

So I really wanted to get some guidance from either \nthe security administration or somebody that had better knowledge than \nmyself what I really needed to do, and I was more than willing to do that, \njust as I have been my whole career. But no one that I could reach out to \ncould give me any guidance as far as this goes. I felt like I was just kind of \nleft out here floundering a little bit, I think. (Tr. 76) \nApplicant provided an event timeline in which he said: \nEvery attempt of mine to gain any information about the status of my \nclearance was met with messages stating that it was still under review \nmonth after month [since] 2018 and that I should remain prepared for the \nworst. Such was the basis for my decision to retain the funds I had \naccumulated to avoid the aforementioned possibility that I would be unable \nto financially support myself after a possible termination of my employment \nas is what I believe to have been the most responsible decision possible \ngiven the circumstances. (AE V at 13) \nAfter his hearing, Applicant indicated in an email that he recently accrued sufficient \nfunds to pay the three delinquent debts, and he closed with the following comments: \nI would further argue that to expend these funds at any time since the \ngovernment originally expressed its possible decision to revoke my \nclearance, or during these proceedings, whether to clear these debts or for \nany other reason would have actually represented precisely the type of \ndecision making and irresponsible acts that I am accused of and under \nreview for in the first place. I maintain that I did not act in bad faith to my \ncreditors in the first place, and I do not intend to do so now. It has also been \nexplained to me more than once that my paying off these debts at any time \nafter my interview would not have necessarily secured my retention of my \nclearance, which further supports my risk assessment and decision to \nensure that I do not place myself in any further financial peril should I lose \nmy employment as a result of this evaluation. I have had to live under these \nincredibly stressful circumstances since these debts occurred, and have \ncarried their weight through numerous setbacks to reach my current \nimproved financial state and do not intend to let anything put me back in \nposition again. I find myself in the position to have built up my finances only \nto be possibly set back to start over after all of the work I have had to put \nforth to regain any sort of financial comfortability after my experienced \nsetback surrounding 2014. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI would again ask all reviewing these proceedings to observe my 25 years \nof credit history and honorable and decorated military service to recognize \nthese events were not indicative of my overall judgement, or reliability and \nthat had it not been for the hardships including the lack of rental payments \nfor the home I had to leave behind in [specific state omitted] to gain \nemployment after retiring from active duty, I would have been quite capable \nof continuing to pay my debts as required as I had throughout my entire \nadult life before, and in the years since this isolated incident.

(AE F; AE G; AE I; AE O) The general sense of their statements is that \nApplicant is dedicated, loyal, diligent, honest, trustworthy, and professional. He adhered \nto the \u201cAir Force core values Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We \nDo.\u201d (AE G) Their statements support his continued access to classified information. He \nhas also received annual pay increases. (AE T) \nApplicant was deployed 11 times and completed numerous training courses during \nhis Air Force career. (Tr. 73; AE H) He received the following Air Force (AF) awards: \nMeritorious Service Medal; AF Commendation Medal with 2 oak leaf clusters; AF \nAchievement Medal; Joint Meritorious Unit Award; Meritorious Unit Award with 3 oak leaf \nclusters; AF Outstanding Unit Award with Valor Device with 7 oak leaf clusters; AF Good \nConduct Medal with 5 oak leaf clusters; National Defense Service Medal; Afghanistan \nCampaign Medal with 1 service star; Iraq Campaign Medal with 1 service star; Global \nWar On Terrorism Expeditionary Medal; Global War on Terrorism Service Medal; AF \nOverseas Ribbon Short; AF Expeditionary Service Ribbon with Gold Border with 7 oak \nleaf clusters; AF Longevity Service with 3 oak leaf clusters; AF NCO PME Graduate \nRibbon with 1 oak leaf cluster; Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon with 1 service \nstar; AF Training Ribbon; and NATO Medal. (AE H) The description of actions in his \nAugust 20, 2003 AF Achievement Medal indicates he was dedicated to his duties, and he \nmade important contributions to the combat mission in Iraq. (AE H) \nApplicant received treatment for anxiety and depression issues that \u201cdeveloped \nover the years of repeated and long-term deployments.\u201d (AE U) He believed his mental-\nhealth issues were due to his exposure to operations and environments during his Air \nForce career, especially when he was in Special Operations.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd.

The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

However, \u201c[e]ven if applicant\u2019s financial \ndifficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his [or her] \ncontrol, the judge could still consider whether applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 \n(App. Bd.

He did not \nprove that he maintained contact with his SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d creditors or that he \nmade written offers to make partial payments to them. He is not credited with mitigating \nthe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($8,174), 1.c ($7,158), and 1.d ($1,466). His annual pay was \nessentially stable for the last seven years.

Feb. 17, 2017)). \nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most negative financial items \nfrom a credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency or the debt becoming \ncollection barred because of a state statute of limitations, whichever is longer. See Title \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission website, Summary of Fair Credit \nReporting Act Updates at Section 605, https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-\nfair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. Debts may be dropped from a credit report upon dispute \nwhen creditors believe the debt is not going to be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond \nto a credit reporting company\u2019s request for information, or when the debt has been \ncharged off. Applicant\u2019s failure to provide more evidence of debt resolution precludes \nmitigation of the charged-off debts on his credit report and debts dropped from his credit \nreport. \nApplicant\u2019s history of non-payment of three of his SOR debts has important \nsecurity implications. See ISCR Case No. 20-01004 at 3 (App. Bd. June 28, 2021) \n(\u201cResolution of a delinquent debt does not preclude further inquiry or examination \nregarding it. Even if an alleged debt has been paid or canceled, a Judge may still consider \nthe circumstances underlying the debt as well as any previous actions or lapses to resolve \nthe debt for what they reveal about the applicant\u2019s worthiness for a clearance\u201d) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-02957 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2017)). Even if he paid the delinquent \nSOR debts after receipt of the SOR, this would not automatically mitigate security \nconcerns. \n[T]he timing of ameliorative action is a factor which should be brought to \nbear in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation. An applicant who \nbegins to resolve security concerns only after having been placed on notice \nthat his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and \nwillingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests \nare not threatened. \nISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2019) (citing ISCR Case No. 17-01256 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018)). While payment of delinquent debts after receipt of the SOR \ndoes not necessarily guarantee approval of access to classified information, it would have \nshown some good faith and some belated efforts to comply with contracts in which he \npromised to repay borrowed funds. \nOne function of an SOR is to place an Applicant on notice of a particular security \nconcern, such as finances and delinquent debts. A financially-based SOR provides an \nApplicant an opportunity to show good faith and establish payment plans, pay debts, or \notherwise mitigate security concerns. An Applicant who is insensitive to the importance \nof expeditiously resolving security concerns may not diligently act to safeguard security. \nApplicant did not establish that he was unable to make more progress sooner in \nthe resolution of his SOR debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 44-year-old aircraft mechanic who has been employed by the same \nDOD contractor since 2015. He served in the Air Force from 1996 to 2014, and he \nreceived early retirement as a technical sergeant under the Government\u2019s Temporary \nEarly Retirement Authority. He receives monthly Air Force retirement pay and medical \nbenefits. He has held a security clearance for seven years while working for the DOD \ncontractor, and there are no allegations of security violations. \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s friends and coworkers and his supervisor provided character \nstatements.

Applicant admitted these debts but provided no evidence of efforts to resolve \nthem. \nAfter the PSI in March 2019, Applicant provided materials from an online program \nadvising him which debts he should pay and in what order. His materials included advice \nregarding the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.f, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.o. He provided no \ninformation about the nature of the advice or what actions, if any, he took to follow it. He \nhas provided no information about his current income and expenses. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information.

Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02\u00ad\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish two disqualifying \nconditions: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nNone of the above conditions are established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are \nnumerous, recent, and were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence \nunlikely. He presented no evidence of circumstances largely beyond his control. He \nsubmitted evidence that he consulted an online financial counseling source, but his \nfinancial situation is not under control. He submitted no evidence of efforts to \n \n resolve his \ndebts. He has not disputed any of the debts. He claimed that the student loans were \nsatisfied by diversion of federal income tax refunds, but he submitted no documentary \nevidence to support his claim. When an applicant claims that a debt has been resolved, \nhe is expected to present documentary evidence supporting his claim.

Feb. \n24, 2011). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline G in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor or to question him about his debts or his \nfinancial situation. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Processing of \nthe case was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nOn June 28, 2022, the case was assigned to me. On July 11, 2022, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing \nfor August 3, 2022. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. During the hearing, \nDepartment Counsel offered 12 exhibits; Applicant offered 29 exhibits; there were no \nobjections, and all exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 14-19; GE 1-12; Applicant \nExhibit (AE) A-AE CC) On August 12, 2022, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing. I \nreceived six post-hearing exhibits, which were admitted into evidence without objection. \n(AE DD-AE II) On August 15, 2022, Applicant indicated all exhibits were provided, and \nthe record closed on August 15, 2022.

(Id. at 460) \nFinancial Considerations \nIn January 2014, Applicant\u2019s net monthly pay was about $10,000. (AE EE (pg. 486-\n487)) Later in 2014, Applicant his net monthly pay was about $18,000. (AE GG (pg. 510)) \nHe had a brief period of unemployment in 2014. From late 2014 to March 2017, his annual \nsalary was about $100,000. (Tr. 59-62, 64; AE HH (pg. 513)) In 2018, Applicant\u2019s annual \nsalary was $170,000. (Tr. 52) His current annual salary is \n \n$145,000. (Tr. 49) His spouse \ndid not work outside their home from 2015 to 2021. (Tr. 50) He spends about $11,000 \nannually to support his autistic child.

In 2006, Applicant \npurchased his residence for $387,000 with financing his builder provided. (Tr. 24) His \nhome\u2019s purchase was financed with two loans from the same mortgage lender (C1), \nprimary mortgage account XX35 and secondary mortgage account XX77. (Tr. 24-25; HE \n3) Lender C1 sold the two loans to Lender A. He made two separate payments to the \nlenders for the two mortgages. (Tr. 32) \nApplicant\u2019s November 14, 2006 mortgage agreement indicates the primary \nmortgage amount was $311,500, the annual interest rate was 8.5 percent, the loan period \nwas 30 years, and the monthly payment was $2,284. (pg. 279) His credit report states he \nhad a $290,643 conventional mortgage (XX35), opened in 2006, modified in 2014, and \nclosed in May 2021, and it was in a \u201c[p]ays account as agreed\u201d status in 2021. (GE 6 at \n6) An April 29, 2009 bill from Lender A for first mortgage account XX35 indicates the \nbalance was $309,214 with a monthly payment is $2,398. (AE L (pg. 103-104)) From \nJanuary 2015 to October 2015, Applicant made the $2,686 monthly payments on his \nprimary mortgage account (XX35), although some of the payments were made 15 to 30 \ndays late. (AE X) This account was transferred or sold to another mortgage company, \nLender C2, and then to Lender Q, on May 21, 2021. (GE 6 at 5) Applicant currently has \na $299,873 FHA mortgage with an $1,835 monthly payment. (GE 6 at 5) The Lender Q \nmortgage is in a \u201c[p]ays account as agreed\u201d status. (Tr. 35; GE 6 at 5) The Lender Q \nannual interest rate is 2.9 percent. (Tr. 36) Applicant\u2019s handling of the XX35 mortgage \naccount does not raise a security concern; however, the relationship between the primary \nmortgage XX35 with the secondary mortgage XX77 will be briefly discussed, infra.   \nIn 2006, Applicant also borrowed $77,822 at an 11.25 percent annual interest rate \nfrom Lender C, and his contract specified monthly payments of $756. (AE K (pg. 75-76); \nAE Y (pg. 295-297)) An April 29, 2009 bill from Lender A for second mortgage account \nXX77 indicates the balance was $77,071 with a monthly payment is $756. (AE L (pg. 105-\n106))  \nAround 2014 to 2015, Applicant changed employment, and he received less pay. \n(Tr. 26-27) He also had a period of unemployment. (AE EE (pg. 478)) He called mortgage \nlender A, and he asked for better loan terms. (Tr. 28) He stopped paying his two \nmortgages. (Tr. 27-28) Lender A provided loan modification documentation; however, \nApplicant had difficulty completing the application and providing all of the supporting \ndocumentation, which was extensive. (Tr. 28-30) In April 2014, Applicant submitted \ndocumentation to modify both of the mortgages. (Tr. 34; AE EE (pg. 478-482)) The two \nloan numbers were written on the bottom of the loan modification request. (Id.) After three \nor four months, a mortgage modification was approved. (Tr. 30-31) \nThe new loan modification agreement states it \u201camends and supplements (1) the \nMortgage, Deed of Trust, or Deed to Secure Debt (the \u2018Security Instrument\u2019), dated the \n14 day of November, 2006 and in the amount of $311,500.00.\u201d (Tr. 39; AE K (pg. 91); AE \nM (pg. 109) The new principal balance was $304,764. (AE K (pg. 93; AE M (pg. 111)) \nApplicant insisted that he believed two mortgages for about $310,000 and $70,000 were \nmerged into one mortgage for about $311,000.

(AE P (pg. 163)) His August 1, 2015 \nLender A statement for account XX77 shows he paid $756 the previous month and $1,600 \nyear to date. (AE Q (pg. 170)) On August 19, 2015, the Lender A wrote Applicant that his \nnew principal balance of the second mortgage was $79,389, which included unpaid \ninterest of $7,391. (AE X (pg. 225-226) Interest was added to his principal balance. (Id.) \nHis new monthly payment was $1,339, and the first payment was due on September 1, \n2015. (Id.) His September 1, 2015 Lender A statement for account XX77 shows he paid \n$756 the previous month and $2,356 year to date. (AE R (pg. 177)) He did not make any \nadditional payments to Lender A for account XX77 after August 2015, and the payment \nfor the year to date remained at $2,356 for the remainder of 2015. (AE V (pg. 205)) \nLender A noted that correspondence was sent to Applicant on the following dates \nafter the August 1, 2015 trial period: November 23, 2015; December 29, 2015; and \nSeptember 5, 2017. (HE 3 at 9) Applicant denied that there were two loan modifications \nsubmitted, and he denied there was a trial period which consisted of monthly trial payment \nin the amount of $756.37, beginning June 1, 2015, through August 1, 2015. (Tr. 42) \nThe following exchange occurred between Department Counsel and Applicant: \n[Department Counsel]: I'm looking at a letter dated August 19, 2015, for \naccount number [XX]77, and it's talking about a principal balance of \n$79,000. Are you telling me that your first mortgage was only $79,000? \n[Applicant]: No. I'm saying that the mortgage that I paid on was the first \nmortgage, which was a much larger sum. \n[Department Counsel]: Right, but in 2015 you did a trial plan to get your \nsecond mortgage back on track. \n[Applicant]: No, I didn't, because there was only one loan modification \napplication that I submitted. If there were two mortgage applications, then I \nwould say, okay, there would be a separate statement for that, but I only \nsubmitted one application. \n[Department Counsel]: What if you did a loan modification on the first \nmortgage and then you also did this trial plan to fix your second mortgage? \nDo you think that's possibly what happened? \n[Applicant]: I don't think so. I only had one payment stub coming from \n[Lender A] as one payment. \n[Department Counsel]: So let's see. So in 2015, though, you were receiving \nseparate statements just for your second mortgage, weren\u2019t you? \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[Applicant]: Before the mortgage modification was occurring, yes, I was \nreceiving two separate statements, two separate mortgage accounts, two \nseparate amounts. After the mortgage modification submission went \nthrough, [Lender A] was only sending one mortgage statement to me at my \naddress, actually in a certified overnight letter, so they were very diligently \nFed Ex'ing these trial statements to my home [address omitted]. So the trial \nitself to them was very important. And as I said, they were sending FedEx \nmail overnight to make sure that those payments were made on time, and I \nsent them as well. (Tr. 42-43) \nApplicant provided payment records from Lender A, which showed that Applicant \npaid $2,686 to address his XX35 debt 11 out of 12 months from December 2014 to \nDecember 2015. (AE X (pg. 247-248)) \nApplicant received multiple bills from Lender A. (AE N-AE W (pg. 149-209)) For \nexample, on December 16, 2015, Lender A wrote Applicant and advised him that his \nregular monthly payment was $756; he owed $5,964 in interest payments for the period \nbefore June 1, 2015; and he accumulated $12,279 in overdue interest payments for the \nperiod up to January 1, 2016. (AE V (pg. 205, 209) \nApplicant said he responded to Lender A\u2019s requests for payments, indicating he \nbelieved the $79,000 second mortgage was included in the loan modification in 2014. (Tr. \n34) In 2017, Applicant complained to the state attorney and Consumer Credit Bureau \nabout Lender A\u2019s attempts to receive payment for the $72,000 mortgage. (Tr. 63) Lender \nA received correspondence about loans XX35 and XX77 from Applicant on August 16, \n2017, and September 3, 2017. (HE 3 at 6) On September 15, 2017, Lender A provided a \ndetailed history of the two loans, including supporting documentation. (Id.) Lender A \nresponded to Applicant\u2019s complaints as follows:  \nOur records indicate on May 14, 2015, the loan ending in [XX77] was \napproved for an Extension Program Trial Period Plan. The trial period \nconsisted of monthly trial payment in the amount of $756.37, beginning \nJune 1, 2015, through August 1, 2015. My research confirms that the trial \nperiod plan was completed, as stated in enclosed letter dated August 19, \n2015. Further research confirms that the extension agreement was to be \nreturned within fifteen days. Our records confirm that it was not returned \nwithin the specified timeframe. I have enclose[d] copies of both letters for \nyour reference.   \n \n[Lender A\u2019s] records indicate that the loan ending in [XX77] was charged off \nand referred to our Recovery Department on January 19, 2016. At the time \nof the charge off, the loan was paid through the September 2014 \ninstallment. I have enclosed a copy of the loan payment history for your \nconvenience. (HE 3 at 7) \n \nOn November 22, 2017, Lender A wrote Applicant asking for payment of $71,998. \n(Tr. 43; AE AA (pg. 433)) Lender A insisted that Applicant owed about $72,000, and \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant maintained the $72,000 was included in the mortgage modification.

(Tr. 44) Lender A \nsold the mortgage account to Lender C2, and Applicant said he continued to receive only \none list of required payments. (Tr. 32) \nApplicant disclosed the issue of his mortgage in his July 24, 2018 SCA. He said, \n\u201cIn the year of 2015, I had applied for a mortgage modification using the home affordable \nrefinance program. My mortgage was 80/20. My income wasn't enough. The bank \nfocused on the primary mortgage - as to the second mortgage I had strongly assume it \nwas being purged into one.\u201d (GE 1 at 57) The Office of Personnel Management February \n28, 2019 summary of Applicant\u2019s interview did not mention Applicant\u2019s theory that the first \nand second mortgage were merged together into the mortgage modification, the summary \nof interview indicates: \nThe reason for the delinquency was due to the interest rate being 11% and \nnot being able to refinance. The account is currently being charged off. The \nSubject is not aware of when the account became delinquent. The Subject \nindicated that he no longer owes anything due to the account being in the \nprocess of being charged off so no further action will be taken.

(GE 3 at 1) In 2021, the lien \nfor the SOR \u00b6 1.a debt was released.

(GE 5, GE 6) \nApplicant said after the hearing he would provide documentations showing that the \ntwo mortgages were included in the same modification. (Tr. 63) He provided his \napplication for a loan modification, which has the two loan numbers handwritten on the \nbottom of the pages. (AE EE (pg. 478-482)) Both mortgages are listed in the income \nportion of the application, and he provided the homeowner\u2019s insurance to Lender A.

(AE B (pg. 7)) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

May 2, 1996). \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d Applicant had sufficient income to pay or resolve his debts, and AG \u00b6 19(a) \nis not established. The record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b) and 19(c). \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nApplicant presented some important mitigating information. Applicant\u2019s credit \nreports reflect paid debts, debts with a zero balance, or debts in current paid as agreed \nstatus, except for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant\u2019s recent credit reports do not show the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and the lien for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a has been released. Applicant\u2019s \nannual income for 2014 to 2017 was $100,000; however, he did not prove that he was \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunable to make the $756 monthly payments to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a. When his income \nincreased, he had an opportunity to resume payments to address the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nApplicant disputed the SOR \u00b6 1.a debt; however, his dispute was not reasonable. \nThe loan modification agreement he provided did not encompass the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nAfter he submitted the mortgage modification, he made the three separate requested \npayments during the trial period to the SOR \u00b6 1.a creditor. His July 1, 2015 Lender A \nstatement for account XX77 shows he paid $756 the previous month and $844 in the year \nto date. His August 1, 2015 Lender A statement for account XX77 shows he paid $756 \nthe previous month and $1,600 year to date. His September 1, 2015 Lender A statement \nfor account XX77 shows he paid $756 the previous month and $2,356 year to date. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). Applicant did not \nshow good faith in his handling of the SOR \u00b6 1.a debt. Contrary to his assertion at his \nhearing, he made the three monthly payments of $756 to the creditor. There are not clear \nindications that future delinquent debt is unlikely to recur. His history of handling his SOR \n\u00b6 1.a debt casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nFinancial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 54-year-old systems engineer who has been employed by a DOD \ncontractor in the area of information technology for several years. He attended college, \nand he did not receive a degree. His exceptionally detailed resume provides additional \ninformation about his background and training. \nApplicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances. He wanted Lender A to \nmodify both of his mortgages. He was being charged interest rates of 8.5 percent on the \nprimary mortgage and 11.25 percent on the secondary mortgage. At his request, Lender \nA modified the first mortgage to the extent of adding unpaid interest onto the principle; \nhowever, the interest rate of 8.5 percent continued. As to the second mortgage, he sent \nin the three payments in 2015, and Lender A sent him the modified mortgage. However, \nLender A did not reduce the interest rate, and Applicant did not sign the modification of \nthe SOR \u00b6 1.a mortgage. Applicant stopped making payments to Lender A on the SOR \u00b6 \n1.a mortgage without good cause. In 2017, Lender A sent Applicant a detailed discussion \nof the XX77 account, and Applicant did not resume payments. He did not establish that \nhe lacked the means to make his SOR \u00b6 1.a mortgage payments from 2017 to 2021.  \nLender A\u2019s release of the lien related to the SOR \u00b6 1.a debt in 2021 is insufficient \nto fully mitigate security concerns. Applicant admitted that he did not pay the SOR \u00b6 1.a \ndebt, which is about $70,000. Applicant did not establish that account XX77 was included \nin the loan modification of account XX35. He did not comply with the contract in which he \nassured the lender that he would pay the debt. His history of handling the SOR \u00b6 1.a debt \ncontinues to cause security concerns. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 57 years old. She has never married and has no children. She received a high school diploma in 1982 and has taken some college courses. She also received a professional certification in 2004. Applicant has worked for several U.S. Government contractors as a technology specialist since at least 2007 and has held a security clearance on and off since 1997. Applicant began working for her current employer, a defense contractor, in March 2021. She is seeking to continue her current security clearance in relation to her work with her employer. (Tr. at 16-19, 32; GE 1 at 9-10; GE 2 at 5; AE A at 3.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she failed to file her Federal (SOR 1.a) and state (SOR 1.b) income tax returns as required for tax years (TYs) 2015 through 2019. As a result, the Government made a preliminary conclusion that Applicant is potentially unreliable and untrustworthy and presents a risk that she will not follow the Government\u2019s rules and regulations. In her Answer, Applicant admitted both allegations. Applicant has a history of non-compliance with the Federal and state tax-filing deadlines. She did not file her tax returns for TYs 2009 and 2010 as required. She filed within the three-year Federal statutory deadline to avoid forfeiture of her tax refunds for 2 those years. The SOR did not allege these facts. In about May 2011, the U.S. Department of Stat",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines \neffective within the Department of Defense after June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on July 8, 2021, one and one-half \nyears after the issuance of the SOR. In her Answer, she requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July 29, 2021. \nThe case was assigned to me on October 13, 2021. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Video Teleconference Hearing on February 23, 2022, \nscheduling the hearing on March 21, 2022. Upon a showing by Applicant\u2019s counsel of \ngood cause, I granted her request for a four-week continuance on March 16, 2022. DOHA \nissued an Amended Notice of Video Teleconference Hearing on March 17, 2022, \nscheduling the hearing for April 18, 2022. The hearing was rescheduled again and held \non April 20, 2022. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n6, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and \nsubmitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F, which were also admitted without \nobjection. I note for the record that AE D is a duplicate of GE 4. At the hearing, Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel requested that the record remain open for the submission of additional \ndocumentary evidence. I agreed to keep the record open until May 4, 2022. Applicant \ntimely submitted two additional exhibits marked as AE G and H, which were also admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 27, 2022. (Tr. \nat 10-13, 48.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 57 years old. She has never married and has no children. She received \na high school diploma in 1982 and has taken some college courses. She also received a \nprofessional certification in 2004. Applicant has worked for several U.S. Government \ncontractors as a technology specialist since at least 2007 and has held a security \nclearance on and off since 1997. Applicant began working for her current employer, a \ndefense contractor, in March 2021. She is seeking to continue her current security \nclearance in relation to her work with her employer. (Tr. at 16-19, 32; GE 1 at 9-10; GE 2 \nat 5; AE A at 3.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she \nfailed to file her Federal (SOR 1.a) and state (SOR 1.b) income tax returns as required \nfor tax years (TYs) 2015 through 2019. As a result, the Government made a preliminary \nconclusion that Applicant is potentially unreliable and untrustworthy and presents a risk \nthat she will not follow the Government\u2019s rules and regulations. In her Answer, Applicant \nadmitted both allegations. \nApplicant has a history of non-compliance with the Federal and state tax-filing \ndeadlines. She did not file her tax returns for TYs 2009 and 2010 as required. She filed \nwithin the three-year Federal statutory deadline to avoid forfeiture of her tax refunds for \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthose years. The SOR did not allege these facts. In about May 2011, the U.S. Department \nof State granted Applicant national security eligibility at the Top Secret level. Applicant \nthen timely filed her returns as required for TYs 2011 through 2014. She received refunds \neach year. For many years, Applicant has claimed zero exemptions on her W-4 tax \nwithholding form, including the tax years that are the subject of the SOR allegations \n(2015-2019). She believed that her level of withholding resulted in the payment of \nsufficient taxes to ensure that she overpaid her Federal income tax liability in each of \nthose years and that she would not be penalized for filing her returns after their due date. \n(Tr. at 34; GE 1 at 35.) \nThe current status of the matters alleged in the SOR is as follows: \n1.a. Failure to timely file Federal tax returns for TY2015 through TY2019 as \nrequired. At the hearing, Applicant claimed that she misunderstood the tax-filing deadline \nbecause she was complying with the three-year restriction for eligibility to receive a refund \nof her overpaid taxes. She filed her TYs 2015 and 2016 Federal tax returns on February \n9, 2018, which was in time to receive Federal refunds for those years. In her September \n2017 e-QIP, she responded to a question in Section 26 by writing: \nI have been late on filing for my federal refund for FY 2015 and 2016. I am \nnot required to file my [State 1] taxes, since I always am due a refund. I will \nmake sure that both FY 2015 and FY 2016 are filed by the extension date \nof October 15, 2017. (GE 1 at 36.) \nAs noted, she actually filed her TYs 2015 and 2016 returns on February 9, 2018, about \nfour months after the October 15, 2017 date provided in her e-QIP. According to the tax \ntranscripts in the record for those two tax years, Applicant had not filed for an extension \nin either year. She believes that the IRS extension request form states that it is \nunnecessary to file for an extension if that taxpayer is due a refund; however, she did not \nprovide any documentation in support of her belief. She testified that she now \nunderstands that she needed to file her returns by April 15th  of the following year. (Tr. at \n36-37, 39-40; GE 4 at 55-56; AE G at 2-3.) \nIn her July 8, 2021 Answer, Applicant wrote that \u201cafter going through my \nadjudication in February 2020 [the month and year when the SOR was issued] . . . I filed \nmy Federal and [State 1] tax returns for tax year 2019 . . . [and] I filed Federal tax returns \nfrom [sic] 2017 and 2018 (via mail).\u201d She did not provide copies of those returns with her \nAnswer, but she provided a copy of her TY 2020 Federal tax return. \nIn response to interrogatories from the CAF in 2020, Applicant submitted a number \nof documents with a cover note, dated September 8, 2020. In her note, she wrote that on \nJuly 15, 2020, she filed her Federal tax returns for TYs 2017, 2018, and 2019, but that \nIRS Tax Account Transcripts for those years were unavailable due to COVID-related \ndelays at the IRS. Instead, she provided copies of her Federal tax returns for those years, \nwhich were undated. After the hearing, Applicant provided an IRS Wage and Income \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTranscript for TY 2017. That type of IRS transcript does not reflect the tax return filing \ndate and whether an extension was requested. At the hearing, Applicant claimed that on \nor before April 15, 2020, she filed for an extension to file her 2019 tax return within six \nmonths after the April 15, 2020 due date, and that she would provide evidence of that \nextension in a post-hearing submission. Her post-hearing submission did not include \nevidence of an extension for TY 2019. Her submission also included an IRS Account \nTranscript, which reflects that her 2020 Federal tax return was filed on May 17, 2021, \nwhich was timely under the IRS\u2019s COVID-related automatic extension in that year. In \nsummary, Applicant failed to timely file her Federal tax returns for TYs 2015 through 2019 \nas required. (Tr. at 42-43; GE 3 at 2; AE G at 4-12.) \n1.b. Failure to file state income tax returns for TY2015 through TY2019 as \nrequired. In her Answer, Applicant admitted that she failed to file her state tax returns for \nthe years alleged in the SOR. She wrote that she was not obligated to file tax years in \nState 1 if she was owed a refund. Applicant provided the same comment in her e-QIP. In \nher Answer she quoted from a page of the website of State 1 that provided information \nregarding tax rules. The quote states: \u201cYou are not required to file if you do not owe any \ntaxes and will not receive a refund.\u201d Department Counsel entered into evidence a page \nfrom what appears to be the same website page, which contains the language Applicant \nquoted in her Answer (GE 5). That exhibit states further that a taxpayer \u201cmust file an \nincome tax return in [State 1] if . . .you have [State 1] adjusted gross income equal to or \ngreater that the [following] amounts: Filing Status \u2013 Single or married filing separately \nIncome Threshold - $11,950.\u201d Applicant\u2019s adjusted gross income in [State 1] in each tax \nyear alleged in the SOR substantially exceeded that threshold. These instructions are \ncontradictory when applied to Applicant\u2019s situation. She never sought a clarification of her \ntax-filing obligation. After receiving the CAF\u2019s interrogatories in 2020, she filed her State \n1 tax returns for TYs 2015 through 2019. The record is unclear if she filed her state tax \nreturns on July 15, 2020, with her Federal tax returns for TYs 2017 through 2019 or on \nanother date. (Answer at 1, 4, 7-14; Tr. at 23; GE 4 at 58-74; GE 1 at 36; GE 3 at 2, 5; \nGE 5.) \nApplicant\u2019s state tax returns for TYs 2015 through 2019 reflect that she was due \nto receive small refunds in each tax year except in TY 2019, when she owed $5. There is \nno documentation in the record showing that she filed her state tax return for TY 2019 by \nthe filing deadline of May 1, 2020 or that she sought an extension to file after that date. \n(Answer at 13-14.) \nMitigation \nApplicant has been in continuous therapy with the same therapist since 2001. In \nSeptember 2013, Applicant experienced serious vicarious trauma at the time of the \nshooting at her worksite at the Navy Yard in Washington, DC. Several of her close \ncolleagues were shot and killed in that incident. She was scheduled to be with those \nindividuals at that time, but a locked conference room door caused her to go elsewhere \nprior to the shooting. Her colleagues stayed behind and became victims of the shooter. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant suffered from \u201csurvivor\u2019s guilt.\u201d As a result of this incident, her \u201cexecutive \nfunctioning skills\u201d were not as good as they needed to be. She entered an \u201cemotional \ntrauma\u201d program to help her recover from that experience. In late 2016, she also began \nconsulting with a psychiatrist who diagnosed Applicant as suffering from severe \ndepression. The psychiatrist prescribed medication for depression, and continues to the \npresent to manage her medication. Applicant described her depression as having been a \n\u201cprogressive\u201d problem, meaning that it worsened over time, until she received medication. \n(Tr. at 24-26.) \nApplicant is a recovering alcoholic and was a frequent drug user in her youth. She \nhas been sober for about 32 years. She remains active in Alcoholics Anonymous and \nworks with her sponsor. Both of Applicant\u2019s parents died in the past two years. Her \ntherapist wrote in a letter in the record that Applicant \u201cmanages her depression, and she \nreaches out for help when she needs more support to manage her depression.\u201d Applicant \ndescribed her current mental health at the hearing as \u201cwonderful\u201d though she is grieving \nthe loss of her parents, with whom she was very close. (Tr. at 24-26, 29; AE A at 1.) \nA senior U.S. Government IT official and a long-time friend of Applicant\u2019s wrote a \nvery positive character reference letter in support of Applicant maintaining her security \nclearance. The friend acknowledged Applicant\u2019s failure to file tax returns and attributed \nher actions to a misunderstanding by Applicant of her tax-filing responsibilities. \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor also wrote a supportive character letter. At the hearing, \nApplicant described her performance reviews as consistently rating her as \u201cexceeds \nexpectations.\u201d (Tr. at 27; AE A at 2-3.) \nApplicant is financially secure and is capable of meeting any financial liability she \nencounters. She has significant liquid assets and minimal personal debts, mainly a \nrelatively small mortgage on her residence. She testified that her liquid assets are for the \nmost part from her inheritance from her father\u2019s estate. Prior to his death, she said she \nwas less secure financially although her annual income over the past decade has been \nwell in excess of $100,000; except in 2017, when she experienced a period of \nunemployment. Due to the need to file estate tax returns for her father\u2019s estate as the \nexecutrix of the estate, Applicant is now working with a CPA. The CPA recently helped \nher submit an extension for the filing of her 2021 Federal tax returns, which was \nnecessary due to her father\u2019s death in 2021. (Answer at 15; Tr. at 46; GE 4 at 24, 35, 45, \n54-58, 63, 67-68, 71; AE E.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes a condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to file her Federal income tax returns for TYs 2015 through 2019 \nas required. This disqualifying condition does not impose a burden on the Government to \nestablish that Applicant knowingly violated Federal law, though the facts establish that \nshe knew when her Federal tax returns were due during this period. She wrote in her e-\nQIP that her TY 2015 and 2016 tax returns were filed late, and she admitted the SOR \nallegations of untimely filings for the entire period in her Answer. She did not comply with \nthe legal filing deadline and instead filed in time to qualify to receive refunds. \nWith respect to her state income tax returns, Applicant believed she was only \nrequired to file her tax returns if she owed taxes. Applicant chose not to prepare her state \ntax returns because she felt comfortable that her state withholding taxes would be \nsufficient to cover her state tax liability. Applicant did not provide satisfactory documentary \nevidence, however, to corroborate her claim that she was not required to file a state \nincome tax return. Applicant failed to file her state tax returns for TYs 2015 through 2019 \nas required. \nThe Appeal Board has stated that a \u201cfailure to file tax returns suggests that an \napplicant has a problem with complying with well-established governmental rules and \nsystems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting \nclassified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). The Board \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhas also explained that \u201cthe three-year statute of limitations is not a grant of a [tax return] \nfiling extension, but only a limitation upon claiming a [tax] refund.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-\n11375 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 17, 2016).  \nThe record evidence establishes a prima facie case for the application of the \nforegoing disqualifying condition. The evidence shifts the burden to Applicant to mitigate \nthe security concern under Guideline F. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nUnder the unique circumstances of this case, the above mitigating conditions have \nbeen fully established. Applicant has filed her Federal and state tax returns for TYs 2015-\n2019. She is presently receiving professional tax advice and understands that she must \nfile her tax returns as required by law. Applicant\u2019s emotional problems and her 2013 work-\nrelated trauma and losses provide context for her behavior during the 2015-to-2019 \nperiod and are circumstances that are unlikely to recur. Her past behavior of five years of \nuntimely tax filings do not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations allegations in the SOR. \nParagraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns regarding her past actions. The situation regarding her TY 2015 through 2019 \ntax returns were resolved in a responsible manner and without any delinquent tax \nliabilities. Her character references and positive work experiences weigh heavily in her \nfavor, especially in light of the emotional trauma she suffered at her DoD worksite in 2013. \nShe has minimized the potential for pressure, coercion, or duress, as well as the likelihood \nof recurrence. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nJOHN BAYARD GLENDON \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

The SOR also alleged Applicant has seven delinquent non-tax debts \ntotaling an additional $8,950. He admitted these seven allegations as well. \nIn Applicant\u2019s October 2018 SCA, he disclosed he failed to file his federal and state \nincome tax returns for TY 2013 through 2017, as required.

(GE 1 at 35-42; Tr. 22) \nIn February 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a Government investigator, and \nhis financial issues were discussed. At that time, he had not resolved his outstanding tax \nissues. Additionally, Applicant acknowledged the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, a charged \noff credit card account for $6,722, and that he had not taken steps to resolve or address \nit. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.j were also discussed. The alleged non-tax\u00ad\nrelated debts appear in Applicant\u2019s 2018 and 2019 credit bureau reports (CBR), but they \ndo not appear in his March 2022 CBR. They were placed for collection between \napproximately 2012 and 2018. (GE 2 at 11-21; GE 3-5) \nDOHA sent Applicant interrogatories at an unspecified date, and he responded on \nJanuary 31, 2020.

He provided \na copy of an April 17, 2020 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) online payment agreement \n(OPA) in which he agreed to pay by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) $284 monthly. This \none-page document does not indicate when the agreement was established, how many \npayments have been made, or what tax years the payments are being applied toward. In \nhis Answer, he indicated that his wife is an accountant, and she filed all of his federal tax \nreturns for him on January 20, 2020, and his State A tax returns for him on February 6, \n2020. \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he has filed all of his federal income tax \nreturns, and he is paying $221 monthly to the IRS. Additionally, he testified that his \npayments started in approximately January 2020, but he did not provide substantiating \ndocumentation at the hearing or after the hearing.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .   \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) Inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues are current, ongoing, and recent. Although he testified that \nhe has been making payments toward his state and federal tax debt since early 2020, he \nfailed to provide substantiating documentation, despite the record being left open to allow \nhim to do so. His failure to file his state and federal income tax returns in a timely manner \nwas admittedly due to his own irresponsibility. The record still lacks concrete evidence \nthat he filed his federal income tax returns for TY 2016, 2017, and 2018 and his state \nincome tax returns for TY 2013 and 2014. He has failed to provide documentary evidence \nof payments toward a payment plan with the IRS or State A. His outstanding balance in \nNovember 2021 with the IRS was over $16,000. \nAccording to Applicant, his wife is an accountant and she helped him file all of the \nrelevant state and federal income tax returns and establish payment arrangements. \nHowever, he failed to provide proof in his February 2020 response to interrogatories, in \nwhich he was specifically requested to obtain copies of his IRS account transcripts; his \nAnswer to the SOR; at the hearing; and after the hearing. Applicant has not demonstrated \nhe has acted responsibly under the circumstances to address and resolve his self-created \ntax issues in a timely manner. Additionally, he provided no proof of payment or resolution \nfor any of his delinquent consumer debts. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(g) \nwas not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nperson analysis.

He failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest of the United \nStates to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCAROLINE E.

He testified that he \nchanged his withholding in about 2018. He also claimed he took action after being \ninterviewed by a Government investigator. He said he does not owe any taxes because \nthe IRS recovered funds via garnishment and captured subsequent tax year refunds. He \nsaid he has no credit issues, and paid off his first home before selling and purchasing \nanother home in December 2021. \nIn the past, Applicant ignored his income tax filing requirements because he did \nnot have the money to pay taxes. He prepared draft returns in 2003 to 2005, but did not \nfile them because he did not have the money to pay the tax owed. He first took a job \noverseas in 2009, which complicated his ability to file tax returns. He continued overseas \nassignments from 2009 to present. In 2011, his bank account was temporarily frozen by \nthe IRS because of tax delinquencies, and his pay was garnished in 2012. He said he \nfiled his 2013 to 2015 tax returns in 2016. In 2017, he changed tax preparation companies \nbecause of alleged criminal practices of his prior preparer. Although not alleged in the \nSOR, Applicant\u2019s 2020 and 2021 returns were filed after the filing deadline. \nApplicant did not submit evidence of state income tax return filings or any balance \ndue, but he claimed that he filed all returns and does not owe state income taxes.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

Security requirements include consideration of a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand a sense of his or her legal obligations. Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union, Local \n473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Failure to \ncomply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established Government rules and regulations. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and regulations is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). By failing to file Federal and state \nincome tax returns in a timely manner, Applicant did not demonstrate the high degree of \ngood judgment and reliability required of persons granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). \nThe timing of resolution of financial problems is also relevant in determining the \nextent to which an applicant has demonstrated mitigation. ISCR Case No. 09-07551 at \n4 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2011). Although not alleged in the SOR, he also failed to pay income \ntaxes when due for many years. Even though Applicant stated that his 2003-2014, and \n2016 to 2017 delinquent income tax returns have been filed, he thereafter failed to comply \nwith the filing requirements for his 2020 and 2021 returns. I have insufficient documentary \nevidence to conclude that his state income tax returns have been filed, and that his state \ntax debts are fully paid. Conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to decide \nwhether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable, to evaluate evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances, or as part of a whole-person analysis. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I have considered Applicant\u2019s \nrecent failure to timely file his 2020 and 2021 tax returns when due, and his failure to pay \nFederal and state income taxes when due, for the limited purposes described above. \nApplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate admitted or proven facts. When given an opportunity to support his contentions, \nhe balked. Although he has now filed all of his Federal tax returns to date, I am not \nconvinced that he has established a track record of consistent, on-time filing of all tax \nreturns when due, and payment of taxes owed when required. I also note that an applicant \nwho begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment and self-\ndiscipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, \n2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018)) \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues have been longstanding and remain a continuing concern. I \ngive mitigating credit for resolving his tax issues with the IRS, however, his repeated \nfailure to file Federal and state income tax returns and pay taxes when due have not been \nsufficiently mitigated given the number of years of intentional non-compliance and \ndisregard. I also have concerns about his overall financial responsibility and willingness \nto comply with future income tax obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s purported failure to file tax returns when due based on his overseas \nassignments is not supported by the evidence. He failed to file for many years before \nbeginning his overseas assignments, and he could have filed on his own or by use of a \ntax preparer despite those assignments. Although he admitted to not managing his taxes \nwell and intentionally failing to file returns when due, he has not sought financial \ncounseling and waited too long to utilize qualified tax preparation services. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (d) \nand (g) apply as he has now filed all income tax returns due, and appears to have paid \noff his Federal tax debts through IRS credits and garnishment. However, no mitigating \ncondition fully relieves him of his overall financial irresponsibility with regard to meeting \nFederal and state income tax obligations on a timely basis. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \noverseas work, military service, family responsibilities, and alleged improprieties by his \ntax preparer.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so. \nIt is not completely clear whether Applicant signed the lease by himself; if he \ncosigned the lease with the friend; or if he cosigned the lease with his consulting \ncompany. The friend was supposed to pay for the lease. I believe the most likely \nscenario is that Applicant cosigned the lease with the friend. Under any of the \nscenarios, Applicant guaranteed to pay the lease if his friend did not, and he is \npersonally liable for the deficiency balance of the lease. This matter has gone on for so \nlong, I conclude that Applicant is unwilling to pay the debt. AG \u00b6 19(b) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s friend defaulted on the auto lease and refuses to pay the deficiency. \nThat was beyond Applicant\u2019s control, but it should not have been surprising to Applicant. \nThere is a reason why the friend could not lease the car on his own, and why the \nleasing company refused to lease the vehicle without a cosigner. Cosigning for a friend \nwho had bad credit was a questionable decision, but Applicant chose to do so in spite of \nall the reasons not to. He has to accept the consequences of that poor choice. \nApplicant and his company had some recent COVID and personal-health \nreasons that had an effect on his ability to repay the debt. However, this issue is years \nold; Applicant has asserted since 2019 that he intends to pay the debt; and he has paid \nnothing. Intentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of \ndebt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nIn the absence of any payments by the friend, the debt is clearly Applicant\u2019s \nresponsibility. Applicant does not have a track record that would enable me to project \nwith any degree of certainty that he will pay the debt. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay the debt. \nHis refusal to pay the debt casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. There are no applicable mitigating conditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service and favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns.1 \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n1  The adjudicative guidelines give me the authority to grant conditional eligibility \u201cdespite the presence of \nissue information that can be partially but not completely mitigated, with the provision that additional \nsecurity measures shall be required to mitigate the issue(s).\u201d I have not done so as the issue in this case \nis not partially mitigated.  \n6 \n",

(Tr. 26) His wife occasionally takes students who \nare sponsored by private donations to visit Israel and experience what it is like. (Tr.41) \nThe purpose of the short visit is to introduce young Jews to their heritage. The trips may \noccur every two years. (Tr. 42) She has never lived in Israel. \nApplicant was adamant that he maintains his Israeli citizenship out of emotional \nand spiritual ties not because he has a preference for Israel over the United States. (SOR \n1.a). His family, along with other American-Jewish persons are fully devoted to the United \nStates. His grandfather served in the U.S. military and is a veteran. His other grandfather \nserved on the national energy committee of President Carter. In tandem, they each \nserved various leadership positions in their local Jewish communities and advocated for \nthe state of Israel.

Despite the \ninstability and armed conflict that have marked Israel\u2019s relations within the region since \nthe country came into existence, Israel has developed a robust, diversified, and \ntechnologically-advanced market economy. The relationship between Israel and the \nUnited States is friendly and yet complex. Since 1948, the United States and Israel have \nhad a close friendship based on common democratic values, religious affinities, and \nsecurity interests. Israel is considered a critical ally and friend of the United States. \nSuccessive U.S. Administrations and Congress have demonstrated a commitment to \nIsrael\u2019s security and to maintaining close bilateral ties. Israel and the United States signed \na 10-year $38 billion memorandum of understanding in 2016 ensuring robust defense \ncooperation. The United States recognized Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital in December \n2017 without taking a position on Israel\u2019s sovereign boundaries.

Israel is a leading recipient of U.S. foreign \naid and is a frequent purchaser of major U.S. weapons systems. \nIn addition to security assistance, the United States participates in a variety of \nexchanges with Israel, including joint military exercises, research, and weapons \ndevelopment. Through an annual joint counterterrorism group and regular strategic \ndialogues, the United States and Israel work together to counter a range of regional \nthreats. As of January 20, 2021, the U.S. State Department reported that the \n\u201cunbreakable bond between [the] two countries has never been stronger.\u201d Yet, the \ninterests of the two countries are not always aligned. The United States is committed to \npromoting a comprehensive and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and to \nencouraging increased cooperation and normalization of ties between Israel and Arab \nand Muslim majority states. \nThe security situation remains complex in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. The \nU.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital in December 2017 and of Israel\u2019s \nsovereignty over the Golan Heights in March 2019, and the U.S. failure to condemn as \nillegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank, have led to a recent rise in anti-U.S. \nsentiment, especially in the West Bank. Several demonstrations occurred at U.S. \ngovernment facilities, and designated foreign terrorist organizations called for the \ntargeting of U.S. persons. Throughout 2019, hostile organizations associated with \ndesignated terrorist groups (Lebanese Hizb\u2019allah, the Popular Front for the Liberation of \nPalestine (PFLP), Hamas, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)) and Iran launched \nmortars, rockets, and incendiary devices into Israel. The U.S. State Department currently \nadvises travelers to reconsider travel to Israel due to COVID-19 and to exercise increased \ncaution in Israel due to terrorism and civil unrest. Travel to the West Bank is to be avoided \ndue to COVID-19, and U.S. travelers are warned to exercise increased caution in the \nWest Bank. All travel to Gaza is to be avoided due to COVID-19, terrorism, civil unrest, \nand armed conflict. Terrorist groups and lone-wolf terrorists continue plotting possible \nattacks in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, \ntargeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local \ngovernment facilities. The U.S. State Department notes that there has been a marked \nincrease in demonstrations throughout Israel, some with little or no warning. The security \ninfrastructure in Gaza is under the control of Hamas, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist \norganization, and the environment within Gaza and on its borders is dangerous and \nvolatile. \nPersons seeking to enter or depart Israel, the West Bank, or Gaza were reminded \nas of January 2021 that they are subject to immigration and security screening, possibly \nincluding prolonged questioning and physical searches, and that they may be denied \nentry or exit. Israeli security officials have on occasion requested access to travelers\u2019 \npersonal email accounts or other social media accounts as a condition of entry. Travelers \nwere advised that they should have no expectation of privacy for any data stored on their \ndevices or in their accounts under those circumstances. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCivilian authorities in Israel maintained effective control over security services in \nIsrael in 2020. Significant human rights issues in Israel in 2020 included reports of \nunlawful or arbitrary killings, including targeted killings of Israeli citizens and soldiers. The \nIsraeli Defense Forces reported 190 instances of rocket fire from Gaza into Israeli \nterritory. The Israeli Security Agency foiled 423 significant terror attacks in the West Bank \nand Jerusalem in 2020. Israeli forces engaged in conflict throughout the year with \nPalestinian militants in Gaza in response to rocket attacks, incendiary balloons, and \nattempted infiltrations. The Israeli military and civilian justice systems found that members \nof the security forces committed human rights abuses on occasion. However, Israel\u2019s \ngovernment took steps to prosecute and punish officials who committed abuses within \nIsrael regardless of rank or seniority. There is no indication that the Israeli government \nhas used coercive methods on its resident citizens to obtain U.S. sensitive information. \nNor are there any reports of direct involvement by the Israeli government in targeting the \nUnited States. \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also  EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) \nThe SOR alleges that in a 2018 subject interview Applicant stated he did not know \nif he held allegiance to Israel or the United States, because he had never been in a \nposition to choose and maintains Israeli citizenship out of emotional ties because it would \nbe spiritually disruptive (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and he served in the Israeli Defense Force from \nApril 2008 to about November 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and he has a standing obligation to the \nIsraeli Defense Force draft and intends on fulfilling his obligation (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The \nsecurity concern under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) is set out in AG \u00b6 9, as follows: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the United states be \nprone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the \ninterests of the United States .Foreign involvement raises concerns about \nan individual\u2019s judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in \nconflict with the U.S. national interests or when the individual acts to conceal \nit. By itself, the fact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is \n \nnot disqualifying without an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at \nconcealment. The same is true for a U.S citizen\u2019s exercise of any right or \nprivilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \nrecognition of a foreign citizenship.  \nThree disqualifying conditions under this guideline are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 10 (a): applying for and/or acquiring citizenship in another \ncountry; and \nAG \u00b6 10 (d): participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \n(1) Assuming or attempting to assume any type of employment, \nposition, or political office in a foreign government or military \norganization. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s dual citizenship is not, by itself, a disqualifying condition.1 \nUnder Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an applicant is a dual national, but \nrather whether an applicant shows a preference for a foreign country through \nactions.\u201d2 Thus, the fact that Applicant\u2019s parents, both U.S. citizens took him to \nIsrael when he was nine months old was not a deliberate action that he took, after \nbeing born as a U.S. citizen. This does not establish AG \u00b6 10(a). \nApplicant returned to Israel because of his heritage. He was drafted by the IDF \nand served six months as a truck driver. AG \u00b6 10(d)(1) is not established. \nApplicant has established the mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 11(a) and 11(b) because \nthe dual citizenship is based on his parental citizenship. AG \u00b6 11(e) applies because he \nno longer has the entitlements and benefits as an Israeli citizen (foreign citizenship) that \npresent a national security concern. These actions do not indicate a preference for Israel \nover the United States. The concerns alleged in SOR under Guideline C are mitigated. \nTherefore, I resolve SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a,1.b, and 1.c in favor of Applicant. \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is articulated in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that \nis inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nDuring his childhood and adolescence, Applicant was in Israel because his U.S. \nparents took him at the age of nine months. Applicant and his parents returned to the \nUnited States where they now live. His immediate family and his wife live in the United \nStates and are U.S. citizens. His aunt and uncle live in Israel. \nReview of Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and connections is warranted to determine \nwhether they present a heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a) or create a potential conflict of \ninterest under AG \u00b6 7(b). Those disqualifying conditions provide: \n1 ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5, 2000 WL 1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, 2000). \n2 ISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd.

The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember or friend living under a foreign government. The nature and strength of the \nfamilial or friendship ties and the country involved (i.e., the nature of its government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human rights record) are relevant in assessing \nwhether there is a likelihood of vulnerability to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment; a close friend or family member is associated with, or dependent on, the \nforeign government; or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against \nthe United States. In considering the nature of the foreign government, the administrative \njudge must take into account any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally \nISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). \nIsrael and the United States have long had a close friendship. The United States \nis committed to Israel\u2019s security. However, Guideline B concerns are not limited to \ncountries hostile to the United States. Even friendly nations may have interests that are \nnot completely aligned with the United States. The Appeal Board has long held that \u201c[t]he \nUnited States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified \ninformation from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have \naccess to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests \ninimical to those of the United States.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 02-11570 (App. Bd. May 19, \n2004). There is no recent report showing direct involvement by the Israeli government \ntargeting the United States. However, the interests of the two countries have not always \nbeen aligned. \nThere is no evidence that Israel has used coercive methods on its resident citizens \nto obtain U.S. sensitive information. However, it does not eliminate the possibility that \nIsrael would employ some non-coercive measures in an attempt to exploit a relative, \nfriend, or acquaintance. Israel faces threats by jihadist groups, other terrorist \norganizations, and some states in the region that are avowedly anti-Israel. Within Israel, \nmany of those attacks are directed at Jewish or Israeli interests. Israel attempts to prevent \nthe indiscriminate acts of violence against its citizens or tourists in Israel and strictly \nenforces security measures designed to combat and minimize the risk presented by \nterrorism. Nonetheless, the risk of terrorism and civil unrest in Israel have led the U.S. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nState Department to continue to advise travelers to exercise increased caution when in \nIsrael. \nApplicant maintains some relationship with three cousins who live in Israel but are \nU.S. citizens. He sees them at weddings, but does not keep in close contact with them.  \nAG\u00b6 7(a) applies. \nThree mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 apply in whole or in part with respect to \nApplicant\u2019s foreign ties and contacts. They are: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant ended his communications with the friends he made while in the IDF. \nThe friends that he has are dual citizens. Some live in the United States. His wife is a \nU.S. citizen. His immediate family live in the United States. However, it is difficult to fully \napply AG \u00b6 8(a) in mitigation, given the very real risk of terrorism faced by Israeli resident \ncitizens. AG \u00b6 8(c) has some applicability in mitigation in that their current contact is \ncasual and infrequent. \nIn evaluating whether Applicant has \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the United States\u201d to trigger AG \u00b6 8(b) in mitigation, it is noted that, despite \nspending a gap year studying in Israel, Applicant has not exhibited or expressed any \ndesire or intent to move to Israel. Applicant was raised and educated mainly in the United \nStates, and he has chosen to pursue his career here as a scientist contributing to the U.S. \ndefense effort. He enjoys an excellent reputation for good character and integrity by those \npersons who have had the opportunity to interact with him on a regular basis. He is not \nlikely to jeopardize his spouse\u2019s security or risk his professional reputation by succumbing \nto any undue foreign influence that could potentially be exerted through his friendships \nwith friends from childhood and adolescence who have chosen to live as Israeli resident \ncitizens. Applicant\u2019s clear preference for his life in the United States weighs favorably in \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nassessing whether he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest for the United \nStates. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). Those factors are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThose factors have been considered in my evaluation of the Guideline B concerns, \nbut some warrant additional comment. When Applicant completed his SF 86 in 2016, he \ndisclosed many personal contacts living in Israel. None of whom he communicates with \nnow. He now has a better appreciation of the risk of undue foreign influence. While \nApplicant cannot control the actions of the Israeli government or of foreign actors that \nmay seek to obtain classified or sensitive information from him by pressuring his friends, \nhe can control his response. He credibly asserts that, if his friends in Israel were to ask \nany probing questions about his work or attempt to exert any foreign influence, he would \nimmediately report it and follow security protocols. After considering the evidence of \nrecord, I am persuaded that Applicant can be counted on to fulfill his security obligations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline C: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant  \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

(GE \n6 at 9; GE 5 at 3) During the onboarding process, the company\u2019s human resources officer \ncontacted Applicant to ask about his college major, which was not listed on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \n(GE 6 at 13) The human resources officer also asked him why his security clearance \napplication (SCA) did not include the advanced degrees listed on the r\u00e9sum\u00e9. (GE 4) \nApplicant informed the human resources officer that he majored in math and minored in \nphysics from the college from which he graduated in 2009. (GE 6 at 14) Also, Applicant \nsaid he would supplement his SCA with the additional information and provide a college \ntranscript the next day. (GE 6 at 15) Applicant did not provide the promised information. \nInstead, he never returned to work, and resigned from the employment three days later. \n(GE 4)  \nApplicant gained another job in May 2018. He submitted the same r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that he \nhad submitted to his previous employer. (GE 5 at 3) He did not list the previous employer \nin the employment history section of the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 submitted to the new employer. (GE 5 \nat 4-5) \nIn response to interrogatories from DOHA in January 2020, Applicant denied \nreceiving the degrees that he had listed on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.

(GE 6 at 13) \nApplicant stated on his April 2018 SCA that he earned a master\u2019s degree in 2014, \nwhen, in fact, no degree was granted to him that year. When asked about the false \ninformation, Applicant testified that he made a mistake, and that he meant to indicate that \n2014 was the last date that he had taken a class at the university. (Tr. 62) Applicant\u2019s \nsubmission of embellished r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and erroneous information on his SCA prompted the \nGovernment to allege that he intentionally falsified this information, as alleged in SOR \nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c. \nIn 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with first degree burglary, a felony. \nThe charge was later dismissed. (GE 7 at 6) In 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith driving while impaired. Subsequently, he was convicted of the lesser offense of \nreckless driving to endanger. (GE 9) In 2007, Applicant was charged and subsequently \nconvicted of driving under the influence. (GE 7 at 4) In 2009, Applicant was charged with \nthe felony of failing to return a rental car. (GE 7 at 7) The charge was subsequently \ndismissed. \nApplicant failed to list any of these arrests, charges, or convictions on his 2018 \nsecurity clearance application. He explained that he thought criminal activity was not \nrequired to be listed if it occurred more than ten years before the completion of the security \nclearance application. (Tr. 77) The security clearance application requires applicants to \ndisclose felony charges or alcohol-related charges, regardless of when they occurred. \n(GE 1 at 38) \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. In 2001, he filed for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy protection. (GE 15) He later converted the case to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, \nwhereupon the debt covered by that bankruptcy was discharged in May 2002. (GE 14) \nThe amount of debt is unknown from the record. \nIn 2016, Applicant\u2019s student loan accounts, totaling approximately $86,000, came \nout of deferment. (Tr. 90) The following year, the IRS conducted a random audit, which \nconcluded that he owed an additional $19,043 in income taxes for tax year 2014. \nIn October 2017, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection, which \nincluded the 2014 tax debt, in addition to student loans of approximately $80,000. (GE at\n7) In September 2021, Applicant obtained a modification of the Chapter 13 bankruptcy\nplan to include tax debts for 2017 and 2018. (GE 18 at 3) The total amount to be paid in\nhis Chapter 13 bankruptcy is $84,142, and Applicant is to satisfy the plan in 60 months.\n(GE 3 at 3) He has been making payments since December 2018.

Specifically, he filed a tax return in 2014 that proved to be \ninaccurate per an audit in 2017, which determined that he owed more money than he \noriginally paid. (Tr. 55) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Moreover, \u201cof special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative \nprocesses.\u201d (Id.) \nApplicant embellished his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, claiming multiple degrees that he did not earn. \nWhen his then employer noticed a discrepancy between his security clearance application \nand his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Applicant quit the job abruptly. He then obtained another job using a \nr\u00e9sum\u00e9 with the same embellishments that he submitted to his previous employer. \nApplicant contends that the erroneous information on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 were mistakes made by \nthe online company that he retained to prepare it. Given the timing of his departure from \nhis previous employer when confronted with the discrepancy, and his use of the term \n\u201cPh.D.\u201d after his name in the signature block of an email he sent to the human resources \nofficer of his previous employer, I conclude that his explanation is not credible. AG \u00b6 16(a), \n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel \nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine \nnational security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies \nwithout mitigation. \nThe egregiousness of Applicant\u2019s falsifications regarding his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 negates the \ncredibility of his explanations for listing a master\u2019s degree that he did not earn on his \nsecurity clearance application, omitting his criminal history record, and omitting delinquent \ntaxes from the security clearance application. In conclusion, Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the Guideline E security concerns. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant has a history of struggling with debt and is currently under a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy payment plan.

He has been paying his federal income tax \ndelinquency under his Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan consistently since December 2018. \nUnder these circumstances, AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required,\u201d does not apply. \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to his divorce. However, he and his third \nwife did not divorce until 2020, four years after his student loans came out of deferment \nand three years after he filed for bankruptcy protection. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that \nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d does not apply. \nApplicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2017, and he has been making income \ntax payments through the plan since December 2018. AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated \nand is adhering to a god-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d \nand AG \u00b6 20(g), \u201cthe individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements,\u201d apply. \nAlthough Applicant has been making payments towards his federal income tax \ndelinquency for more than two years, approximately $30,000 remains overdue. \nConsequently, AG \u00b620(a) \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d does not apply. \nIn sum, while he presented some mitigation, it is too soon to conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the financial considerations security concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider \nthe totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s deliberate misrepresentations, his lack \nof credibility when confronted with them, and his ongoing financial problems disqualifies \nhim from security clearance consideration. Upon considering this case in the whole-\nperson concept, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 52-year-old wireless communications engineer for a defense contractor, employed since April 2019. He was the president of his own communications company from August 1999 to at least April 2019. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1995, a master\u2019s degree in 1996, and a professional certificate in 2002. He married in 2014 and has three children. The SOR alleges under Guideline F, that Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes for tax year 2013, totaling about $33,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); and owes about $23,000 in delinquent taxes for tax year 2013 to his state of residence (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The SOR also alleges six charged-off debts or collection accounts, totaling $62,711 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1g, and 1.j); and two defaulted student loans totaling $128,902 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i). Applicant admitted the state tax debt and a collection account (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e); and denied the remaining allegations with explanations. He provided supporting documentation with his Answer to the SOR, in response to Government interrogatories, and in his response to the FORM. The record evidence is sufficient to support the SOR allegations. Applicant was self-employed from 1999 to 2019. Applicant fell ill in 2001 with Crohn\u2019s disease that required hospitalizations and emergency surgery. Prior to 2019, he had flare ups that prevented him from working.

On February 23, 2022, a complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on February 28, 2022. He responded \nwith an undated letter and documents collectively marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, \nwhich was admitted in evidence without objection. He later forwarded a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy discharge order, marked as AE B, and admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Government Exhibits (GE) 4-7 are admitted into evidence without objection. \nGEs 1 and 2 are the SOR and Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, which are already part of \nthe record. GE 3 is his August 2021 written request for a decision based on the \nadministrative record. The case was assigned to me on June 16, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 52-year-old wireless communications engineer for a defense \ncontractor, employed since April 2019. He was the president of his own communications \ncompany from August 1999 to at least April 2019. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1995, \na master\u2019s degree in 1996, and a professional certificate in 2002. He married in 2014 and \nhas three children. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F, that Applicant is indebted to the Federal \nGovernment for delinquent taxes for tax year 2013, totaling about $33,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); \nand owes about $23,000 in delinquent taxes for tax year 2013 to his state of residence \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b). The SOR also alleges six charged-off debts or collection accounts, totaling \n$62,711 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1g, and 1.j); and two defaulted student loans totaling $128,902 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i). Applicant admitted the state tax debt and a collection account (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e); and denied the remaining allegations with explanations. He provided \nsupporting documentation with his Answer to the SOR, in response to Government \ninterrogatories, and in his response to the FORM. The record evidence is sufficient to \nsupport the SOR allegations. \nApplicant was self-employed from 1999 to 2019. Applicant fell ill in 2001 with \nCrohn\u2019s disease that required hospitalizations and emergency surgery. Prior to 2019, he \nhad flare ups that prevented him from working. He used credit cards to bridge the gaps \nin his income. His disease is now manageable. (AE A) He stated in his response to the \nFORM, that a major contract with a large phone and internet carrier was cut in 2018. He \nsaid prior to this loss of business, his debts were current. (AE A) Alternatively, he stated \nin his personal subject interview (PSI) with a Government investigator in July 2019, that \nthe contract with a wireless carrier was cut in the winter of 2015, resulting in a significant \nfinancial loss including credit card debts, two vehicle repossessions, and inexplicably, an \ninability to pay Federal and state income taxes for tax year 2013. (GE 5) Applicant \nsecured employment with a defense contractor in April 2019 with an annual salary of \n$130,000. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are Federal and state income tax debts for tax year 2013. In \nhis 2019 SCA, Applicant reported his tax delinquencies for tax year 2013. He stated in \nresponse to his state delinquency: \nAs an entrepreneur we have to balance and make sure payments are made\nto all parties. Due to slow pay from clients it\u2019s a steady game to catch up.\nThere was also a point where I had Chron\u2019s [sic] and had to deal with that\nas well as meeting payroll and invoices. Due to ending of contract I had to\nmake sure that contractors were paid before I could take care of my\npersonal finances. I put subcontractors before me personally. I have\nrequested payment arrangements for both state and federal and have a\nplan to have it fully paid within 6 months to one year. Although they gave\nme five years to repay I would like to clear up and pay off early. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn the SCA section reporting the Federal tax delinquency, he stated: \u201c[p]ayment \narrangements have been made but the amount was too high. Requested that the agency \nwould reduce the monthly amount.\u201d \nIn his 2019 PSI, Applicant claimed that he was unable to pay his Federal and state \ntax obligations for tax year 2013 \u201cdue to lack of income from losing the contract.\u201d However, \nthe only lost contract he discussed in the PSI was the loss of the 2015 contract. In his \nresponse to interrogatories and adoption of his PSI, he wrote on the PSI; \u201cworking with \nCPA. Proposed payment plan is $200/mnt.\u201d (GE 5)  \nApplicant attached a state tax authority payment plan agreement (dated January \n2020) to his response to interrogatories to pay $468.81 per month for 60 months, \nbeginning February 2020. He had a balance due of $23,773.47. (GE 5 attachment C) In \nhis Answer to the SOR, he said he was unable to make payments according to the \nagreement due to COVID and a lack of funding. (Ans.) Also, according to his interrogatory \nresponse, he failed to file state tax returns when due for tax years 2012, 2013, and 2015 \nto 2018, and apparently failed to pay state taxes when due for tax years 2011 to 2014. \n(GE 5 interrogatory response) I have not considered unalleged tax information for \ndisqualification purposes, however it may be considered when assessing Applicant\u2019s \ncredibility, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in the whole-person analysis. \nApplicant obtained another payment plan with the state, dated July 15, 2021, that \nestablished a payment of $437.73 per month for 60 months, beginning on August 15, \n2021. He made one payment of $430 toward this debt in August 2021. It is unclear why \nhis payment was short of the required amount. (AE A) He then noted in his response to \nthe FORM, that \u201c[w]ithin 30 days of discharge, I will re-establish payment plan terms.\u201d (AE \nA) There is no evidence of further payments made on this debt. \nApplicant\u2019s interrogatory response regarding his delinquent Federal taxes shows \na failure to file Federal income tax returns in tax years 2012 to 2013, and 2015 to 2018. \n(GE 5) He is indebted to the IRS for tax years 2010, 2013, and 2014, totaling about \n$33,000.

He paid the user fee and \nthree payments of the required amount in May 2021, to cover balances due for May to \nJuly 2021. He then noted in his response to the FORM, that \u201c[t]his debt will not be \ndischarged in the chapter 7 filing, and within 30 days of discharge, I will establish new \npayment plan terms and resume payment.\u201d There is no evidence of further payments \nmade on this debt. \nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in January 2021. Applicant said the tax debts \nwere not discharged under Chapter 7, so he will need to reestablish payment plans with \nthe IRS and the state. (AE A and B) Applicant provided a form showing a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy discharge order was signed on May 9, 2022, however he did not provide filing \ndocuments that would show what debts were claimed, discharged, or the total amount of \nthe discharge. (AE B) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d are charged-off credit accounts. Applicant paid the small debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c in December 2020. He claimed to be disputing the account in SOR \n\u00b6 1.d, but did not present evidence of a legitimate dispute. He then negotiated a \nrepayment plan with the creditor in March 2021, paid three of the six required $50 \npayments, then stopped. In his response to the FORM, he claimed that the account would \nbe included in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a collection account for an insurance company. Applicant claimed \nthat he disputed the account with a credit repair company, but did not produce evidence \nof such a dispute or any documentation showing the credit repair company\u2019s work on his \nbehalf. In his response to the FORM, he claimed that the debt would be included in his \nChapter 7 bankruptcy. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is a collection account for a credit-card company. Applicant made \npayment arrangements with the collection agent in February 2021, showed evidence of \ntwo payments, but claimed he paid three of five $50 payments in March 2021. In his \nresponse to the FORM, he claimed that the account would be included in his Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.j are charged-off vehicle loans for two vehicles that were \nrepossessed. Applicant\u2019s 2021 credit bureau report (CBR) shows a Toyota account with \nthe first delinquency reported in September 2015, and a major delinquency reported in \nApril 2021. On the Mercedes-Benz account, the first delinquency was reported in June \n2015, and the major delinquency was reported in June 2019. (GE 7) In his PSI, he said \nthe vehicles were used in his business, and were repossessed because he fell behind on \npayments as a result of his lost contract in 2015. (GE 5) In his SCA, he said the accounts \nbecame delinquent in early 2017, and that he had not taken any action after the Toyota \nwas repossessed. Regarding the repossessed Toyota and Mercedes-Benz, he said he \nbelieved that once they were repossessed, the issue was resolved.

In his \nresponse to the FORM, he claimed that the accounts would be included in his Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy, but no documentary evidence was submitted to show the debt was included \nor discharged in bankruptcy. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i are student loans. Applicant did not report his delinquent \nstudent loans on his SCA. According to his CBRs, his loans were reported delinquent in \nDecember 2016, in February 2017, and again reported as 120-days past due in \nNovember 2017. In May 2019, the student loans were placed for collection. (GE 7) In \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he noted that \u201cpayment terms have been established with \nthe student loan. Payments have been made and are attached.\u201d (Ans.) With his Answer, \nApplicant included a letter, dated May 8, 2020, from a collection agent, agreeing to \nrehabilitate the loan for nine monthly payments of $5, beginning in May 2020. No \npayments were made until December 2020, when Applicant made three $5 payments \nafter receiving a letter, dated December 1, 2020, from a new loan servicer. The letter \nshows a balance due of $137,251, although Applicant deleted what is likely other relevant \ninformation on the letter. A student loan statement dated February 23, 2021, shows the \nloans to be in a forbearance status, with $5 monthly payments beginning in November \n2020 and ending in September 2021, with a balance due of $137,165. (Ans.) From March \n2020 to December 31, 2022, student loan collections were paused due to a Federal \nCOVID-19 relief order. In response to the FORM, Applicant stated that within 30 days of \nhis Chapter 7 discharge, he will \u201crequest the income repayment plan and re-establish \npayment plan terms.\u201d (AE A) \nApplicant submitted his resume, a certificate of completion, and several positive \ncharacter letters and letters of recommendation. He is described as trustworthy, honest, \na good friend, and having good judgment. He stated that he has previously held security \nclearances, and was the facility security officer (FSO) for his company when it held a \nfacility clearance. (AE A) \nHe submitted a personal financial statement (PFS). (AE A) The PFS shows a net \nmonthly income of $14,500 per month based on his and his spouse\u2019s net pay, but appears \nto understate his gross salary by $10,000. The PFS indicates that he has a net remainder \nof $6,948 per month, and is prepared to pay $500 monthly payments on his student loans, \n$667 per month for Federal tax debt, and $430 per month for state tax debt. In reference \nto the PFS, he noted that \u201c[t]he new remainder that is shown on the financial statement \nindicates that there are funds remaining to apply to\u201d the IRS, state, and student loan \ndebts. (AE A) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

He incurred business losses that may \nhave resulted in difficult economic conditions that may have been outside of his control, \nand significant health challenges, however, his health issues and stated loss of a large \ncontract do not match the timeline for his failure to pay his 2013 taxes, student loans, and \nother delinquent debts over the years. I am not convinced that his failure to pay federal \nand state income taxes for tax year 2013 when due was outside of his control. Although \nhe has eliminated some debts via a recent Chapter 7 bankruptcy and will attempt to obtain \nhis third IRS and student loan repayment plans, I am not convinced that he has \nestablished a current track record of reliable, substantial, and sustained payments, \nconsistent with his income and monthly net remainder, toward the successful resolution \nof his Federal debts. Likewise, his efforts toward resolution of his state taxes has been \nineffective and inconsistent with a considered effort to resolve the matter. \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to address his debts post-dated his SCA, PSI, and for many, the \nSOR. He filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in early 2022 after giving the Government \nassurances that he was addressing his debts through payment plans or voluntary \npayments. He paid a small debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, but others were alternately disputed \nor partially paid. He made limited payments on Federal and state taxes, but stopped \nbecause of a lack of enough income or other reasons. His recent track record of debt \nresolution has been intermittent, disjointed, and inconsistent. \nWhen tax issues are involved, an administrative judge is required to consider how \nlong an applicant waits to file his or her tax returns, whether the IRS generates the tax \nreturns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete \nmaking payments. The Appeal Board's emphasis on security concerns arising from tax \ncases is instructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016 (reversing \ngrant of security clearance and stating, \"His delay in taking action to resolve his tax \ndeficiency for years and then taking action only after his security clearance was in \njeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated himself and does not \nreflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone entrusted \nwith the nation's secrets.\"); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd.

A person who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012). A security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the \nprotection of national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor other obligations to the \nGovernment has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified information. ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with complying with \nwell-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules \nand systems is essential for protecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability \nrequired of those granted access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s claimed income anomalies, attempts to establish \npayment arrangements, and recent bankruptcy. However, Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nhave been longstanding and remain a continuing concern. I give mitigating credit for \nattempting to resolve his tax issues with the IRS and state, and recent efforts to \nrehabilitate his student loans, however, his history of failure to pay federal and state \nincome taxes when due, student loans, and other debts have not been sufficiently \nmitigated given the number of years of non-compliance and disregard. Utilizing the \nbankruptcy process can be effective in mitigating financial concerns, and substantiated \ndisputes are recognized, but a subsequent sustained and reliable track record of on-time \npayments on an individual\u2019s remaining financial accounts are required to gain full \nmitigation credit. That track record does not exist in this case. I also have concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s overall financial responsibility and willingness to comply with future financial \nobligations. Applicant may have recently come to the realization that he should resolve \nhis taxes, student loans, and other financial obligations quickly in order to qualify for \nsecurity eligibility, but it has been late in coming. He has not shown documentary evidence \nof financial counseling to assist him with budgeting and resolution of debts when they \narise, and substantiated, credible debt disputes. He claimed to have used a debt \nresolution company, but provided no documentary evidence in support of that claim. He \nuses a tax consultant to review his self-prepared tax returns, but did not offer evidence \nthat he attempted to resolve his tax debts within a reasonable time after acquiring them. \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s financial responsibility, especially with regard to fulfilling his \nFederal financial obligations when required, is questionable. Despite a substantial income \nand net monthly remainder since April 2019, he has been late to respond to financial \ndelinquencies and may never have responded had his need for a security clearance never \narisen. An applicant who waits until his clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts \nmay be lacking in the judgment and self-discipline expected of those with access to \nclassified information. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). The existence \nof a payment arrangement with an appropriate tax authority does not compel a favorable \ndecision. ISCR Case No. 17-03462 (App. Bd.

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s self-\nemployed income anomalies, health challenges, his relatively recent efforts to resolve \ndebts, and his current financial status. Because he requested a determination on the \nrecord without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity \nbased on demeanor, or to question him about the circumstances that led to his tax \nobligations and other debts. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person, including exceptions available under Appendix C of SEAD \n4. I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial\ndelinquencies. \n \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b, and 1.d-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nGregg A.

Applicant stated that she was afraid of losing her security \nclearance. (Government Exhibit 4.) \nIn regard to the use of illegal drugs, Applicant initially stated that she has never \nused any illegal drugs. (Government Exhibit 4.) She later admitted that she used \nmarijuana in high school; about once a week for the last few months of her senior year. \nThen, in college her use of marijuana continued until she quit, during the second \nsemester. Applicant did not use marijuana again until 2015, when she visited Colorado \non two separate occasions. While in Colorado, Applicant smoked marijuana and ate \nmarijuana gummy bears one or two times on each trip. Applicant decided to use \nmarijuana since it was legal in Colorado, and because she was on vacation. The \nmarijuana made her feel loopy, lazy, and dumb. Applicant stated that the effects of the \ngummy bears lasted longer than when she would smoke marijuana. Applicant states \nthat she no longer uses marijuana. (Answer to SOR.) Applicant also admitted that in \n2018, she used ecstasy at a music festival in Ireland with a friend. She stated that a \nstranger offered it to her and she tried it. (Government Exhibit 4.) \nApplicant also stated that since April 2017, she has been seeing a mental health \ncounselor for general anxiety and depression. Her therapy has continued on a weekly \nbasis since then. (Government Exhibit 4.) \nIn September 2019, Applicant was referred for a psychological evaluation in \nrelation to her security clearance application. (Government Exhibit 5.) During the \nevaluation, Applicant discussed her difficulty managing her alcohol consumption, and \nhow she has used alcohol to cope with stressors and stressful situations. Applicant \nstated that her work with her therapist \u201cfocuses on curtailing her drinking.\u201d In describing \nher drinking pattern, Applicant stated that she currently does not drink during the work \nweek, but drinks wine on Friday and Saturdays. She has never had a period of drinking \ndaily, but has \u201cbinged\u201d in social situations. She does not know if she has been formally \ndiagnosed with depression and anxiety, but she reported that she is sad and anxious. \nThe last time she drank more than she wanted to was October 28, 2019. She reported \nthat she had three beers. Prior to that she drank too much around Valentines day while \non a ski trip. She consumed about three seltzers and whiskey (about 5-6 drinks). She \ndoes not remember everything from that night, but knows that she had too much to \ndrink. She states that she currently drinks heavily every couple of months while at \nhome. During those times, she has said things to her roommate that she does not want \nto say, and has done things she does not want to do. For about a two-month period in \n2017, she stopped drinking alcohol, and found that she experienced increased energy \nand motivation. She then returned to her regular drinking pattern. Applicant has never \nattended Alcoholics Anonymous or any rehabilitation program for her alcohol problem. \n(Government Exhibit 5.) \nApplicant explained that in social situations, she becomes very anxious. At least \nonce a month she has to leave work early because of her emotions. Applicant admitted \nthat her alcohol consumption has helped her connect with people, but also \nacknowledged that it has made things worse for her most of the time.

Applicant believes that she has control over her alcohol consumption since \nshe tries to follow moderation management. (Answer to SOR.) \nDuring the evaluation, Applicant discussed her struggle with Attention Deficit \nHyperactivity Disorder, reflected by an ongoing pattern of impulsivity and poor decision \nmaking. For about a year, Applicant has been taking a medication prescribed by her \nprimary care physician for her attention deficit related difficulties. Applicant explained \nthat she was having difficulty accomplishing anything at work, and felt like she was not \nquite hearing what people were talking to her about. She feels that she does not listen \nwell and felt overwhelmed. She feels that overall, the medication has helped her, but it \ncan make her feel sick and anxious in the mornings. (Government Exhibit 5.) \nThe psychologist stated that Applicant\u2019s above-described conditions have led to \nepisodes of poor judgment and failure to consider her behavior and decisions in the \nface of her obligations related to her security clearance. Her poor decisions can place \nher in unsafe situations that could make her a target for blackmail or at risk of coercion, \nparticularly when she is drinking heavily. She is unable to stop drinking altogether and \nsays things she wishes she did not say to her roommate when she is home drinking on \nthe weekends. Her alcohol use places her judgment and reliability at risk as she has \nplaced herself in dangerous situations when drunk or impaired by alcohol, and later \nreports that she cannot report the details. (Government Exhibit 5.) \nApplicant was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive \nDisorder and Alcohol Use Disorder, Moderate. \nThe psychologist concluded that \nApplicant\u2019s overall prognosis is poor. She continues to struggle to eliminate episodes of \nheavy drinking, continues to experience impairing levels of depression and anxiety, and \nappears insufficiently motivated to put the requirements of her security clearance before \nher own desires, even when recognizing the possible security concerns of her actions. \nIt is also noted that given her ongoing pattern of alcohol use, her ongoing symptoms of \ndepression and anxiety, as well as her impulsive decision making, her judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness appear impaired which impacts her capacity to properly \nsafeguard classified information. (Government Exhibit 5.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set \nout in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline.

No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 28 contains five conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are strongly established in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; and \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability or \ntrustworthiness; \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 29 contains five conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has mental health conditions \nthat have affected her judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness for some time, and \ncontinue to affect her. There is no indication that her mental-health conditions are \nunder control or in remission. In fact, her prognosis is poor.

The \nPsychological Conditions guideline is found against Appellant. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana for many years knowing it to be against the law. Most \nrecently, she used it while in possession of a security clearance. This conduct raises \nserious questions about her reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating factors are applicable. Applicant used marijuana for many \nyears, and while possessing a security clearance. The use of marijuana is in violation \nof Federal law. It is also against DoD policies. Applicant is prohibited from using \nmarijuana while holding a security clearance. \nHer conduct shows poor judgment, \nunreliability and untrustworthiness. \nGuideline E- Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in in making a recommendation relevant to a \nnational security eligibility determination, or other official government \nrepresentative. \nApplicant deliberately concealed her illegal drug on her security clearance \napplication dated September 21, 2016.  This conduct raises serious questions about her \nreliability and trustworthiness. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 17 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. One of the conditions is potentially applicable: \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is \nunlikely to recur.  \nApplicant stated that she was afraid to reveal her past drug use in fear that she \nwould lose her security clearance. Her conduct shows poor judgment, unreliability and \nuntrustworthiness. \nConsidered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, \nreliability, and/or the ability to abide by rules and regulations. To be entrusted with the \nprivilege of holding a security clearance, applicants are expected to abide by all laws, \nregulations and policies that apply to them. Applicant has chosen to live her life to her \nconvenience, and has disregarded the law. Knowing that the use of marijuana is illegal, \nand then to lie on the security clearance application about it is unacceptable. Under the \nparticular facts of this case, Applicant does not show the requisite character or judgment \nof someone with maturity, integrity, reliability and stability necessary to access classified \ninformation. At this time, Applicant does not meet the qualifications for a security \nclearance. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case.

He has a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. Applicant has worked for a defense contractor since February 2015. He served \nin the U.S. Army on active duty from March 1974 until September 1987, and in Army \nReserve components from 2000 to 2015. All of his discharges were honorable. (Item 3.) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant has 11 delinquent debts totaling \n$117,979. Applicant denied those Guideline F delinquencies, except for one. He admitted \n\u00b61.b. He denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.c., and 1.d. (duplicate charges), \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 1.f. (invalid \ncollections), \u00b6\u00b6 1.g., 1.i., and 1. j. (paid), \u00b61. k. (invalid charge), and \u00b6 1.h. (\u201cnever had \ncard in his name\u201d). \nUnder Guideline E, SOR \u00b6 2.a. alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose \nthe delinquent accounts listed in SOR \u00b6 1. SOR \u00b6 2.a. alleged that Applicant additionally \nfailed to disclose a mortgage account that went into foreclosure in 2015. To SOR \u00b6 2.a., \nhe answered that \u201crental property went into foreclosure.\u201d \nApplicant provided no documents in support of his Answers to the SOR. The \nevidence supports the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. (Items 5 and 6.) Aside \nfrom one mortgage account in foreclosure, Applicant claimed no knowledge of the \ndelinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. (Item 4.) He was, however, knowledgeable \nenough to answer with some detail about those accounts, including details about the \nmortgage account. (Items 2 and 4.) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR debts are established by the Government\u2019s credit reports. Applicant\u2019s \ncarelessness about his financial affairs demonstrates a potential and an actual risk of \ncompromise of classified information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(b) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. Applicant produced no documents supporting his answers. The \nDOHA Appeal Board has previously held that it is reasonable to except applicants to \nproduce documents showing that debts have been or are being resolved. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 07-10310 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2008). I find that none of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 apply in this case. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct  \nIn assessing an allegation of deliberate falsification, I consider not only the \nallegation and applicant\u2019s answer but all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-\n(9) (explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). Under Guideline E for personal \nconduct, the concern is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d A statement is false or dishonest when it is made deliberately (knowingly \nand willfully). \nIn this case, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified facts by failing to disclose his \nfinancial delinquencies. The record shows that Applicant had sufficient knowledge and \ninformation to identify his delinquent accounts in his SCA. I find that he deliberately failed \nto disclose his financial delinquencies in his SCA. Therefore, I find against Applicant on \nSOR \u00b6 2(a). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Formal Findings \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n                             \n \n \n                               \n \n \n \n                                 \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and Guideline \nE in my whole-person analysis. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

SOR \u00b6 1.a alleged that from approximately June 2003 through at least December 2018, Applicant purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency; and SOR \u00b6 1.b alleged that Applicant continued to purchase and use marijuana after he had been granted a DOD security clearance in March 2009. In his SOR Answer, Applicant stated that he did not remember exactly what year he first used marijuana. His best estimate is that he first used marijuana sometime between 2003 and 20",

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 29, 2019, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF-86). On March 12, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency, Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines H and E. The SOR \ndetailed reasons why the CAF was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  \n \nOn April 14, 2020, Applicant submitted his Answer to the SOR through counsel. \nWhen Applicant submitted his SOR Answer, he was represented by counsel, but he \nwas no longer represented by counsel at his hearing. On November 27, 2020, \nDepartment Counsel was ready to proceed. On December 15, 2020, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me. On February 18, 2021, \n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing for March 23, 2021. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified, \ncalled one witness to testify on his behalf, and submitted Applicant Exhibit (AE) 1, a \nthree-ring binder containing Tabs A  through Q, which was admitted without objection. \nOn April 2, 2021, DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.).  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nBackground Information \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old program manager employed by a defense contractor \nsince December 2006. (GE 1; Tr. 11-12) He seeks to retain his security clearance, \nwhich he has held since March 2009. (Tr. 12-14)  \n \nApplicant received his high school diploma in June 2002. He was awarded a \nBachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering in December 2006. (AE 1(H); Tr. \n14-17) Applicant married in January 2014, and has an 18-year-old stepdaughter and a \n9-year-old daughter. Applicant\u2019s wife is not employed outside the home. (GE 1; Tr. 17-\n19)  \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nApplicant self-reported past marijuana use on his January 29, 2019 SF-86 during \nhis periodic security clearance renewal. (GE 1) He was subsequently interviewed on \nMay 23, 2019, by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator regarding his \nmarijuana use. (GE 2) He elaborated on his marijuana use in his April 14, 2020 SOR \nAnswer as well as during his testimony. The following summarizes that drug use. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged that from approximately June 2003 through at least December \n2018, Applicant purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency; and SOR \u00b6 1.b \nalleged that Applicant continued to purchase and use marijuana after he had been \ngranted a DOD security clearance in March 2009. \n \nIn his SOR Answer, Applicant stated that he did not remember exactly what year \nhe first used marijuana. His best estimate is that he first used marijuana sometime \nbetween 2003 and 2005, which was between 15 and 17 years from the time he \nsubmitted his SOR Answer. He used marijuana approximately two or three times per \nyear, if that, until 2018 when his marijuana use increased to approximately one to two \ntimes per month for a short period. His increased marijuana use in 2018 came about \nwhen recreational marijuana use became legal in his state of residence. He stated that \nhe was under the mistaken belief that its use was acceptable at the federal level as well. \nApplicant acknowledged his marijuana use was \u201cextremely improvident\u201d and added that \nhe has no intention to ever use marijuana or any other drug again. Applicant\u2019s testimony \nwas consistent with his January 29, 2019 SF-86 and his SOR Answer. (SOR Answer; \nTr. 19-22; GE 1; AE 1(Q)) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nApplicant used marijuana for \u201crecreational use\u201d and for its \u201crelaxing capabilities \nevery now and then.\u201d Applicant added that he used marijuana about 20 times while \nholding a clearance from March 2009 to December 2018, further adding that that \nnumber was \u201cjust a guess.\u201d He acknowledged that his marijuana use was a violation of \nstate and Federal law, security clearance regulations, and his employer\u2019s drug-free \nworkplace policy. Applicant volunteered that his marijuana use was a \u201cpoor choice.\u201d (Tr. \n24-26)  \n \nThe driving force behind Applicant\u2019s decision to quit using marijuana occurred \nwhen he was renewing his security clearance application in December 2018. He stated, \n\u201cit really dawned on me I shouldn\u2019t have done it, and it was a poor choice.\u201d Applicant \nhas used marijuana with his wife. His wife still uses marijuana, which is legal in their \nstate of residence. Applicant stated that even though he has been around individuals to \ninclude his wife who use marijuana, he is not tempted to use it anymore. (GE 2; Tr. 26-\n29, 33-35) Applicant stated, \u201ctrustworthiness is one of the most important parts of \nhaving a Security Clearance. You don\u2019t want someone that lies. . . . You make \nmistakes, you\u2019ve got to own up to it. So, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d (Tr. 57) \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s March 2, 2009 OPM interview, he told the investigator that he \n\u201cstopped (using marijuana) in 2007 because the use no longer appealed to him and he \nwanted to start a career.\u201d (GE 4; Tr. 29-30) \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \nThe concerns identified under this Guideline are listed as two separate \nallegations and discussed in order as indicated in the SOR. \n \nThe Government cross-alleged the drug involvement and substance misuse \nconcern alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b under SOR \u00b6 2.a. Additionally, the SOR alleged \nthat Applicant falsified his December 29, 2008 SF-86 when he disclosed marijuana use \nfrom November 2005 through July 2007, and purportedly failed to disclose his \ncontinuing use of marijuana as set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n \nApplicant denied falsifying his December 2008 SF-86. He explained that when he \ncompleted his December 2008 SF-86, he was not using marijuana and had not done so \nsince July 2007. He emphasized the information he provided on his December 2008 \nSF-86 was accurate, as he was not using marijuana at that time. (SOR Answer; Tr. 22-\n24) Apparently, the confusion over the \u201ccontinuing use\u201d question arose when Applicant \nsubmitted his January 29, 2019 SF-86 and estimated his marijuana use as June 2003 to \nJune 2017. (GE 1; Tr. 24) \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nApplicant called one character witness (CW) to testify on his behalf, a technical \ndirector and co-worker he has known since 2013. CW has held a clearance since \napproximately 1985. CW provided a favorable professional and personal assessment of \nApplicant. She stated among other things that Applicant is trustworthy, loyal, and she \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nhas no reason to question his ability to hold a security clearance. CW did concede on \ncross-examination that following the law, rules, regulations, and company policy is an \nimportant part of holding a security clearance. CW acknowledged that Applicant made \nmistakes and errors in judgment. That said, she noted that he self-reported his \nmarijuana use and based on her first-hand knowledge of him believes that he will not \nrepeat those mistakes. CW also submitted a reference letter. (AE 1(P); Tr. 36-48) \n \n \nApplicant submitted performance reviews covering the years 2017 to 2020, \nnumerous professional certificates and awards, and six reference letters. The \ncumulative nature of this evidence documents that Applicant has excelled in his \nprofessional capacity and in that capacity has contributed to the national defense. He is \ntechnically competent, well liked, trusted, and respected by his peers and management. \n(SOR Answer; AE 1(A) \u2013 1(P); Tr. 50-56) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n  \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nAG \u00b6 24 provides the security concern arising from drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse stating: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance, including . . . purchase. . . ;\u201d and \u201c(f) any \nillegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive \nposition.\u201d From about 2003 to December 2018, Applicant purchased and used \nmarijuana with varying frequency. He continued to purchase and use marijuana after he \nwas granted a security clearance in March 2009. He possessed marijuana before he \nused it. Further review is required. \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are \ncontained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substances. See \nDrug \nEnforcement \nAdministration \nlisting \nat \nhttps://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/marijuana/index.html. See also Gonzales \nv. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I). \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b). \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully applies; however, Applicant provided some \nimportant mitigating information. He voluntarily disclosed his marijuana use on his \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nJanuary 2019 SF-86, during his May 2019 OPM interview, in his SOR response, and \nduring his hearing. He ended his marijuana use around December 2018. He promised \nnot to use marijuana in the future. \n \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive at this time. In ISCR Case \nNo. 16-03460 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the applicant had a history of marijuana \nuse, and the Appeal Board said: \nA clearance adjudication is aimed at determining if an applicant has the \nrequisite judgment and reliability to abide by rules designed to protect \nclassified information. . . . [Security concerns arise if] there is doubt as to \nwhether he [or she] will follow the regulatory requirements for handling \nclassified information, which might, in the event, appear burdensome. \nAccess to national secrets entails a fiduciary duty to the U.S. A person \nwho enters into such a fiduciary relationship is charged with abiding by \nlegal and regulatory guidance regardless of whether he or she believes \nthat guidance to be wise. \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use occurred after Applicant completed his December \n2008 SF-86, after his March 2009 OPM interview, and after being granted a security \nclearance in March 2009. \u201cAn applicant who uses marijuana after having been placed \non notice of its security significance, such as using after having completed a clearance \napplication, may be lacking in the qualities expected of those with access to national \nsecrets.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-03191 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 26, 2019) (citing ISCR Case No. \n17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019) (\u201cAn applicant\u2019s misuse of drugs after having \nbeen placed on notice of the incompatibility of drug abuse with clearance eligibility \nraises questions about his or her judgment and reliability\u201d).) Applicant\u2019s spouse and \nsome of his friends are marijuana users, and it is likely that he will be in the vicinity of \nmarijuana in the future. It is too soon after his abstinence from marijuana use beginning \nin December 2018, to rule out the likelihood of his future marijuana use. Guideline H \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated at this time. \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 provides the security concern arising from personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nAG \u00b6 16 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n  \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes:  \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. \n \n \nApplicant denied deliberately falsifying his December 2008 SF-86 regarding his \npast drug use. As noted, the apparent confusion arose when Applicant submitted his \nJanuary 2019 SF-86 and estimated his marijuana use as June 2003 to June 2017. In \nlight of Applicant\u2019s explanation, discussed above, I accept his explanation as credible \nand find for him with regard to SOR \u00b6 2.b. However, Applicant continued to use \nmarijuana after completing his December 2008 SF-86, his March 2009 OPM interview, \nand after being granted a security clearance in March 2009. The general concern under \nAG \u00b6 15 and specific concern under AG \u00b6 16(e) apply. Further review is required. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity was unwitting, has \nceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations.  \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant continued to use \nmarijuana after his initial disclosure of marijuana use on his December 2008 SF-86, \nfollowed by his assurances to an OPM investigator in March 2009 that he stopped using \nmarijuana in 2007 and wanted to pursue his career. Following these representations, he \nwas granted a security clearance in March 2009 and used marijuana intermittently for a \nten-year period while hold a security clearance. He used marijuana knowing that it \nviolated state and Federal law as well as company policy. Applicant is to be \ncommended for self-reporting his past marijuana use and his assurances that he \nstopped using marijuana in December 2018. However, those assurances ring hollow \nafter ten years of infrequent recreational marijuana use while holding a security \nclearance.   \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe ultimate determination whether to grant national security eligibility must be an \noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and \nthe whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion under Guidelines H and E is \nincorporated in this whole-person section. However, further comments are warranted. \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old program manager, who has been working for a \ndefense contractor since 2006. In 2006, he was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nmechanical engineering. Applicant has enjoyed a highly successful career as a defense \ncontractor. There is no evidence of security violations, improper disclosure of classified \ninformation, or that Applicant compromised national security. See ISCR Case No. 18-\n02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020) (noting admissibility of \u201cgood security record,\u201d and \ncommenting that security concerns may nevertheless not be mitigated). \n \nApplicant disclosed his marijuana use on his January 2019 SF-86, and during his \nMay 2019 OPM interview, SOR response, and hearing. An honest and candid self-\nreport of drug abuse is an important indication that, if granted security clearance \neligibility, the individual would disclose any threats to national security, even if the \ndisclosure involves an issue that might damage his or her own career or personal \nreputation. However, the mitigating weight of Applicant\u2019s disclosures is undermined by \nhis marijuana use after his March 2009 OPM interview. A 15-month period of \nabstinence from December 2018 to March 2021, the date of his hearing, is insufficient \nto overcome a ten-year period of marijuana use while holding a security clearance and \ncontinued his ongoing exposure to marijuana.   \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the \nrecord discloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing \nISCR Case No. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). At the expense of being \nrepetitive, Applicant\u2019s self-reporting of his marijuana use is commendable and shows \nconsiderable strength of character. If Applicant continues on his current path of \nremaining drug-free, he will in all likelihood establish a track record that will lead to a \nmore favorable outcome should he reapply for a security clearance.   \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the \nDirective, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant mitigated the falsification \nconcerns under personal conduct; however, he failed to mitigate a pattern of rule \nviolations under personal conduct and drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \n \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n     Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n     Subparagraph 2.a: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n     Subparagraph 2.b:   \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nConclusion \n \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After considering the FORM, including Applicant\u2019s July 2021 response to the SOR (Item 2), I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 56-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen, who immigrated from Pakistan. He acquired his U.S. citizenship in May 1991. He was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in June 1996 and a master\u2019s degree in January 2003. (Items 3-4.) He has been married since March 2013. (Item 3.) He has one daughter, who was born in 2014. (Item 8.) He is currently being sponsored for security clearance eligibility. On February 18, 2011, Applicant completed an SF 86 for a background investigation to work as a team lead with a federal contractor. The SF 86 was not included in the FORM, but a memorandum of record completed during an investigation and adjudication by another U.S. government agency for access to its headquarters in 2019 reflects that Applicant\u2019s February 2011 SF 86 was inaccurate in several aspects. (Item 8.) Applicant was apparently issued a secret clearance on April 28, 2011 (Item 6), although other information indicates that the investigation initiated by the 2011 SF 86 was discontinued on April 4, 2012, with no OPM assessment. (Item 8.) On May 24, 2016, Applicant completed and certified as accurate an SF 86 for a consulting position with a DOD agency. (Items 3, 8.)

The SOR \nexplained why the DCSA CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DCSA CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations on July 31, 2021, and requested a \ndecision on the written record in lieu of a hearing before an administrative judge from the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On September 29, 2021, the \nGovernment submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of a statement of the \nGovernment\u2019s position and 11 documents pre-marked as Item 1 through Item 11. The SOR \nand Applicant\u2019s SOR response were included as Item 1 and Item 2, respectively. \nIn the FORM, Applicant\u2019s attention was directed to a summary report of his personal \nsubject interview (PSI), which took place on February 13, 2017. (Item 4.) Even though \nApplicant had adopted the summary report of his PSI with some clarifications and \ncorrections on March 9, 2020, he was advised that he could comment on whether the PSI \nsummary was accurate, make any corrections, and object to inclusion for lack of \nauthentication. DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant three times: on October \n7, 2021 and November 20, 2019, through two different companies; and on January 18, \n2022, to him at his home address of record. Applicant was instructed that any response \nwas due within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on January 23, 2021. No \nresponse was received by the February 22, 2022 due date for his FORM response. \nOn March 18, 2022, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant. I received the case file and assignment on March 28, 2022. \nSOR Allegations and Answer \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline E that Applicant\u2019s access to a U.S. government \nagency\u2019s installation was revoked in June 2019 for a pattern of falsification and personal \nconduct found to pose an unacceptable risk to the government\u2019s physical assets and \ninformation systems (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The SOR alleges in SOR \u00b6 1.b that Applicant falsified his \nMay 2016 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (SF 86) by responding \nnegatively to its inquiries regarding adverse employment information and by deliberately \nfailing to disclose \u201cthat information as set forth in subparagraph 1.a, 1.b [sic], above.\u201d The \nSOR alleges in SOR \u00b6 1.c that Applicant deliberately omitted material facts from his May \n2016 SF 86 by not listing \u201cthe employment as set forth in subparagraph 1.a, 1.b, above.\u201d \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c concern the alleged deliberate failure to disclose the employment \ninformation in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The references to SOR \u00b6 1.b in the text of the allegations \nconcerning SF 86 falsification (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and omission (SOR \u00b6 1.c) appear to be drafting \nerrors. The SOR also alleges under Guideline E that Applicant was fired from jobs in \napproximately March 2011 for timekeeping issues (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and November 2010 for not \nbeing a good fit for the job and attendance issues (SOR \u00b6 1.e). (Item 1.) \nWhen Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, he admitted that he was denied \naccess to the government agency\u2019s installation, but he denied that he intentionally falsified \nany information. He asserted that he responded on government forms to the best of his \nknowledge and recollection. About his failure to report the employment information in SOR \n\u00b6 1.a, he explained that he was self-employed at the time and listed his consulting \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncompany as his employer on his May 2016 SF 86.

(Item 2.) \nFindings of Fact \nAfter considering the FORM, including Applicant\u2019s July 2021 response to the SOR \n(Item 2), I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 56-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen, who immigrated from Pakistan. \nHe acquired his U.S. citizenship in May 1991. He was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in June \n1996 and a master\u2019s degree in January 2003. (Items 3-4.) He has been married since \nMarch 2013. (Item 3.) He has one daughter, who was born in 2014. (Item 8.) He is \ncurrently being sponsored for security clearance eligibility. \nOn February 18, 2011, Applicant completed an SF 86 for a background investigation \nto work as a team lead with a federal contractor. The SF 86 was not included in the FORM, \nbut a memorandum of record completed during an investigation and adjudication by \nanother U.S. government agency for access to its headquarters in 2019 reflects that \nApplicant\u2019s February 2011 SF 86 was inaccurate in several aspects. (Item 8.) Applicant \nwas apparently issued a secret clearance on April 28, 2011 (Item 6), although other \ninformation indicates that the investigation initiated by the 2011 SF 86 was discontinued on \nApril 4, 2012, with no OPM assessment. (Item 8.) \nOn May 24, 2016, Applicant completed and certified as accurate an SF 86 for a \nconsulting position with a DOD agency. (Items 3, 8.) He denied that he ever held a foreign \npassport, even though he had entered the U.S. in 1986 on a Pakistan passport. He \nreported that he has worked as a self-employed program or project manager since January \n1994. He listed only two other employments on his SF 86. He indicated that he worked as \na team leader for a federal contractor from January 2010 until February 2011, when the \nproject was completed, and then as a web developer for another federal contractor from \nFebruary 2011 to April 2011, when that job was completed. He responded negatively to the \nSF 86 inquiries concerning whether, in the last seven years, he was fired from a job; quit a \njob after being told he would be fired; left a job by mutual agreement following charges or \nallegations of misconduct; left a job by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory \nperformance; or received a written warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or \ndisciplined for misconduct in the workplace, such as violation of a security policy. (Item 3.) \nApplicant also responded negatively on his May 2016 SF 86 to whether the U.S. \ngovernment had ever investigated his background or granted him a security clearance or \naccess eligibility. He answered negatively to a question concerning any foreign travel \noutside the United States in the last seven years.

He admitted that he had previously held a Pakistan passport and claimed \nthat he did not list it on his SF 86 because the question was unclear. He expressed his \nbelief that his Pakistan passport had been destroyed and stated that he surrendered it in \norder to obtain U.S. citizenship. When asked about his current residence, Applicant stated \nthat he lived with his wife and daughter. He had not listed a daughter on his SF 86. He \nclaimed she had been born after he completed his SF 86. Regarding his listed \nemployments, Applicant stated that, as a self-employed consultant, he had done some \nclassified work for the DOD in the past. He related that his work for the employers listed on \nhis SF 86 was through his consulting business. Applicant denied any other employment in \nthe preceding ten years. Information had surfaced during Applicant\u2019s background \ninvestigation that he had been fired from a job in March 2011 for not being professional in \nsubmitting his work hours (timekeeping issues) and from a previous employment as a \nsenior principal consultant in November 2010 and was ineligible for rehire after receiving \nwarnings about his attendance (SOR \u00b6 1.e). When confronted with that employment \ninformation, Applicant stated that he had not violated any oral or written agreements with \nthe employer in SOR \u00b6 1.e, and that he had left the job because he was relocating. \nApplicant denied any difficulties in that job. He claimed to not recall being fired from the \ncompany in SOR \u00b6 1.d for timekeeping issues. (Item 4.) \nRegarding foreign travel, Applicant stated that he went on a honeymoon cruise to \nEurope. He explained that he did not list the trip on his May 2016 SF 86 due to oversight. \nHe admitted that the government had investigated his background in the past, and he had \nheld a secret clearance for work for the DOD. He cited oversight as the reason for the \nomission of his previous background investigations on his May 2016 SF 86. (Item 4.) \nOn September 6, 2017, Applicant notified the DOD that he had a new job, did not \nneed a clearance, and would not cooperate with the background investigation. (Item 9.) \nThe investigation requested by the DoD agency and initiated by the May 2016 SF 86 was \nclosed on February 12, 2018, with an indication of major issues that would be disqualifying. \n(Item 8.) The issues of concern were not specifically delineated in the report showing the \nclosure of the investigation. \nOn April 1, 2019, Applicant was hired by a contractor to support an information \ntechnology support services contract with a non-DOD government agency. Reportedly \nbased on the DISCO eligibility determination from April 2011, Applicant was briefed for \nsecret-level access by the contractor who hired him in 2019. (Item 6.) Applicant was \ninterviewed by a personnel security specialist for installation access eligibility. (Item 9.) The \nsecurity specialist noted discrepancies from Applicant in the dates concerning the \nestablishment of his consulting company. When she asked him about his employment \ntermination by the company in SOR \u00b6 1.e, Applicant related that he was asked to do \ninformation technology work that was not in his field, when he was hired for other work. He \nadmitted that he was verbally told to not return to work for the company. He denied ever \nhaving heard of or having worked for the company in SOR \u00b6 1.d or the company listed on \nhis May 2016 SF 86, which he had indicated during a 2012 investigation was a sister \ncompany to the company in SOR \u00b6 1.d.

When confronted about the discrepancies \nduring an interview with a security specialist in 2019, Applicant responded that these things \nwere \u201cjust not true.\u201d (Item 8.) \nDuring the 2019 investigation by the non-DOD government agency, records were \naccessed from the OPM which reportedly showed that Applicant had completed 12 SF 86 \nforms for background investigations since 2005, including for four investigations by the \nOPM. Eight of the investigations were discontinued, but he was granted secret clearance \neligibility after one investigation. At one point, he was granted interim access eligibility for \ntop secret information, although it was downgraded to secret when the investigation was \ndiscontinued. Thirty-five separate companies requested that he maintain a secret \nclearance. (Item 8) \nOn May 24, 2019, the chief of the security office at the government agency\u2019s \nheadquarters issued a determination of unfavorable fitness for Applicant to work as a cloud \ndata architect at its headquarters. The agency made a determination that the issuance of a \nPersonal Identity Verification (PIV) card to Applicant presented an unacceptable risk based \non his dishonest conduct and a reasonable belief that he made material, intentional false \nstatements in connection with his contract employment. (Items 10, 11.) Applicant was \nfound to have been fired from the employments in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e; to have omitted \nfrom his SF 86 his in-laws, an address, employments, the adverse employment \nterminations, his foreign travels, his previous possession of a foreign passport; and his \nprevious background investigations. He was also found to have provided discrepant \ninformation about the dates for establishment of his consulting company. (Item 11.) \nOn June 19, 2019, the government agency revoked Applicant\u2019s access to its \ninstallation for a pattern of falsification and personal conduct discovered during his \nbackground investigation. (Item 5.) On July 11, 2019, Applicant had a meeting with the \nchief of the protective services at the installation. Applicant failed to provide sufficient \nmitigating information to resolve the concerns that he presented an unacceptable risk to \nthe government\u2019s physical assets and information systems at the installation. The \nrevocation of access was for three years at which time Applicant can reapply for a position \nwith the government agency. (Item 7.) \nOn July 11, 2019, Applicant resigned from his employment with the company that \nhired him in April 2019 to support an information technology contract at the government \nagency\u2019s headquarters. The decision to revoke Applicant\u2019s access to its headquarters and \nits installation rendered him unemployable by the federal contractor. On July 30, 2019, the \ncontractor filed an adverse information report to ensure that the DCSA was aware that \nApplicant\u2019s access to the non-DOD installation had been revoked. At least one clearance \nreporting system showed that Applicant was still eligible for access at the secret level.

Regarding his Pakistan passport, Applicant \nindicated that his mother found his two Pakistan passports, which were expired. He gave \nthe dates for his honeymoon travel. Regarding his employment terminations from the \ncompanies in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, he again denied any recall of any timekeeping issues \nwith the employer in SOR \u00b6 1.d or any verbal warnings for attendance at the company in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e, and continued to assert that his separation from that job was mutual. (Item 4.)  \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant denied any intent to falsify information. (Item 2.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.

Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \nRegarding SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant does not dispute that his access to a non-DOD \ngovernment agency\u2019s installation was revoked in July 2019 for what adjudicators and \nsecurity officials with that agency concluded was a pattern of falsification and personal \nconduct. Personal conduct security concerns are raised by the pattern of inconsistencies \nand omissions that led to the revocation of access eligibility. \nAmong the discrepancies and omissions, which are amply detailed in Items 8, 9, \nand 11 of the FORM, are omissions from Applicant\u2019s May 2016 SF 86 that are not \nseparately alleged in the SOR but were issues that led to the revocation of his facility \naccess to the non-DOD installation in 2019. The evidence shows that Applicant responded \nnegatively to SF 86 inquiries concerning whether he ever held a foreign passport, whether \nhe traveled abroad in the last seven years, and whether his background had ever been \ninvestigated by the government for clearance eligibility. He did not indicate on his SF 86 \nthat he had a child, and explained that she had been born after he completed the form. \nThe evidence showed that Applicant held a Pakistan passport to enter the United States; \ntraveled on a honeymoon cruise in 2013 and to Europe in 2014; had several background \ninvestigations over the years before his May 2016 SF 86; and has a daughter born in 2014. \nHe also omitted employment information from his SF 86. On being confronted with the \nomitted employments during his February 2017 PSI, he claimed he had no problems at the \ncompany alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e and asserted he had no recall of being fired for timekeeping \nissues from the company in SOR \u00b6 1.d. More recently, when interviewed by the \ngovernment agency for access eligibility to its headquarters, he claimed he did not recall \never working for the company in SOR \u00b6 1.d. The evidence of omission from his SF 86 and \nof discrepant information provided during his February 2017 PSI and his more recent \ninterviews for work with the non-DOD government agency establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved in \nmaking a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nRegarding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, the SOR alleges under SOR \u00b6 1.b that Applicant \nfalsified his May 2016 SF 86 by not disclosing the adverse employment information set \nforth in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and under SOR \u00b6 1.c that he failed to list the employment in SOR \u00b6 1.a \nwhen he was required to list all his employment activities from the present and working \nback ten years. If the employment information Applicant is alleged to have deliberately \nomitted was his revocation of access to a non-DOD installation in 2019, Applicant cannot \nbe held to have falsified a May 2016 SF 86 form by not disclosing a future consequence of \nhis pattern of dishonesty or omission or an employment that had not yet occurred. \nAmong the cited pattern of dishonesty that led to the revocation of installation \naccess to Applicant in 2019 was his omission from his May 2016 SF 86 of his involuntary \nterminations from the jobs alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. The evidence shows Applicant \ndid not list his employment with the company in SOR \u00b6 1.e on his May 2016 SF 86. \nMoreover, with respect to the employment in SOR \u00b6 1.d, even if I accept that there is a \nconnection between that company and the company listed on his SF 86 as his employer \nfrom January 2010 to February 2011, Applicant claimed on his SF 86 that he left the job \nwhen the project was completed. He did not report that he had been fired. However, \nneither SOR \u00b6 1.b nor \u00b6 1.c specifically allege that Applicant deliberately omitted that \nadverse employment information. The Appeal Board has held in ISCR Case No. 12-11375 \nat 6 (App. Bd. June 17, 2016) that administrative pleadings should be liberally construed \nand easily amended. However, the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c are unintelligible as \nwritten. \nApplicant disputes the involuntary employment terminations from the companies \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. The personnel records from those employers, which could \nshow the reason for his employment ending, are not in evidence. Investigators for the DOD \nin 2017 and for another government agency in 2019 reported Applicant was fired for \ntimekeeping and attendance issues, respectively, based on information gleaned during \ntheir investigations of Applicant\u2019s background. There is a presumption of regularity in the \nconduct of one\u2019s official duties, and there is no evidence whatsoever that any of the \ninvestigators or interviewers made a false report. Furthermore, when interviewed during his \ninvestigation for access to the non-DOD government installation, Applicant admitted that he \nwas told not to return to work for the employer in SOR \u00b6 1.e. If the decision for him to leave \nwas mutual, it was under adverse circumstances. Applicant\u2019s lack of credibility because of \nthe pattern of omissions and inconsistent statements makes it difficult to believe he was \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot fired. The employment terminations establish the security concerns under AG \u00b6 16(d), \nwhich provides: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, \nbut which, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information, This includes, but is \nnot limited to, consideration of: \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nApplicant has the burden of demonstrating sufficient mitigation to overcome the \npersonal conduct security concerns raised by his pattern of falsification and inconsistent \nstatements (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and his involuntary terminations from two employments for cause \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e). The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 may apply in \nwhole or in part: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nApplicant made some corrections to his May 2016 SF 86 during his February 2017 \ninterview. He admitted that he had previously held a Pakistan passport; that he had a \ndaughter; that he had taken a honeymoon cruise to Europe; and that his background had \nbeen investigated previously by the DOD for a secret clearance in 2009 or 2010. AG \u00b6 \n17(a) does not fully apply, however. He claimed that he did not disclose on his SF 86 that \nhe held a Pakistan passport because the question on the SF 86 was unclear. He did not \nelaborate as to what was confusing about the relevant SF 86 inquiry (\u201cHave you EVER \nbeen issued a passport (or identity card for travel) by a country other than the U.S.?\u201d). He \nasserted during his February 2017 PSI that his foreign passport had been surrendered to \nobtain his U.S. citizenship, but in March 2020 asserted that his mother had found two \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nexpired Pakistan passports for him. He claimed during his PSI that his daughter was born \nafter he completed his May 2016, when she had been born in 2014. He did not report \ntravel to Europe in 2014 that surfaced during his more recent interviews for access to the \nnon-DOD installation. \nFurthermore, Applicant had to be confronted by the OPM investigator with the \ninformation of his employment terminations from the companies in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. He \ndenied any recall of being fired by the employer in SOR \u00b6 1.d and claimed that he had no \ndifficulties during his employment with the company in SOR \u00b6 1.e.He subsequently told a \nsecurity specialist during an interview for access eligibility to the non-DOD government \ninstallation that he never heard of or worked for the company in SOR \u00b6 1.d. AG \u00b6 17(c) has \nsome applicability because of the passage of time since he was fired. Even so, he \ndemonstrates a lack of reform by continuing to deny that the employments ended under \nunfavorable circumstances. Applicant\u2019s denial of any intentional false statements in other \naspects as well cannot be reconciled with the evidence of omissions and inconsistencies. \nAG \u00b6 17(d) was not established. The personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline E is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). It is well settled that once a \nconcern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). For the reasons noted above, I am unable to \nconclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for Applicant at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nElizabeth M.

Applicant testified at his hearing that his girlfriend\u2019s children were with their \nfather. Applicant and their mother, his girlfriend, went to pick them up. The children came \nout of the house, and Applicant buckled the kids into their car seats, and then heard his \ngirlfriend scream from inside the house. He went inside and saw her ex-husband with a \nsawed off shotgun. He wrestled it away from him. Applicant was terrified. He grabbed a \nceremonial sword from the wall and used it to hit the man\u2019s arm. Applicant testified that \nhe reported the incident to the police and Applicant was arrested. The charges against \nhim were later dismissed. (Tr. 134-146, 154; GE 2, 5) \nIn 2011, Applicant was arrested and charged with aggravated assault. He testified \nthat he was at a bar, having a private discussion with his friend, when a man intervened \nand they got into an argument. Then the man threw a wet napkin at him. Applicant \nretaliated by throwing a napkin holder at the man and striking him in the face. Applicant \nsaid he regretted his conduct and should not have thrown the object. (Tr. 118-119) \nApplicant made a statement to police at the time of his arrest. He told them he and \na friend were walking by a bar and an employee of the bar singled him out and began \nyelling at him. He began to yell back. He told the police he never went inside the bar and \nremained outside during the verbal altercation. He said the men from the bar began to \nchase him and his friend. Applicant told the police he observed a hand gun. He said one \nof them had brass knuckles with a knife attached and was waving it at him saying \u201ccome \non\u201d in a threatening manner. He said he was in fear of his life. He testified that he lied to \nthe police. (Tr. 117-123; GE 2, 6, 7) \nWitness statements and a surveillance video differ from Applicant\u2019s version of \nevents. Applicant was inside the bar, and he began yelling at one of the employees, who \nwas later identified as the manager of the bar. Applicant gave him the middle finger and \nthe manager responded in kind. Applicant picked up a plastic napkin holder and threw it \nat the manager, striking him on the left side of his head. The manager and another \nemployee began chasing Applicant and his friend outside the bar and down the street. \nWhile in pursuit, the manager called the police. Applicant had pepper spray and pointed \nit at the manager, who turned away, and Applicant sprayed his back. The police arrived \nand confiscated brass knuckles from the employee who ran with the manager. There was \nno gun. (GE 2, 6, 7) \nThe police reviewed the videotape and noted that the manager was behind the \nbar, and Applicant walked up to it and began yelling at him. Applicant then gave the \nmanager the middle finger. The manager gave it back and then Applicant threw the napkin \nholder at the manager, striking him on the side of the head. Applicant would not leave the \nbar. The manager then called the police and he and his employee chased Applicant and \nhis friend. Applicant admitted he lied to the police because he was afraid of getting in \ntrouble. He said he later told the truth to the judge. He testified that the state decided not \nto prosecute the charge in exchange for Applicant completing community service, which \nhe did. The charges were nolle prossed. He believed he also paid a fine. There were no \nprobation requirements.

These charges were the result of an incident involving road rage. \nApplicant\u2019s testimony differs greatly from police reports and witness statements of what \ntranspired. Applicant claimed he was the victim. His son, 16 years old at the time, was in \nthe car with him. Applicant testified that the other vehicle tried to run him off the road. He \nand the occupants of the other vehicle were cursing at each other back and forth while \ndriving. They met at a traffic light. He said his vehicle was blocked in by the other cars. \nHe testified that he got out of the vehicle and saw two men approaching his vehicle. He \nasked them to leave and was attacked by two men. He pepper sprayed them. He thought \none had a knife because he was stabbed. Applicant then ran back to his car to retrieve \nhis gun, and chambered a round. The man was crawling away from Applicant on his \nhands and feet, retreating. Applicant estimated he was maybe 10-15 feet away, but still \na threat. Applicant then walked over to the man and pointed the gun at him and asked \nhim where the knife was. The man ignored his command. Applicant then left the area and \nwas later stopped by the police. (Tr. 29-32, 76 -117, 158-172) \nApplicant told the police that when he stopped his car, two men came to his vehicle \nand tried to grab his son from the interior of the car and tried to fight him. Applicant was \ndefending himself. He went crazy when they tried to hit his son. He used pepper spray on \nthem to get them away. He took out his gun to hold them back. He was in fear for his and \nhis son\u2019s lives. He told the police that after he stopped the car, a man who was not an \noccupant of the other vehicles, who had been sitting on the curb, walked up to Applicant\u2019s \nvehicle and attacked him. Applicant pepper sprayed him, and they began to fight. Another \nperson, also not involved in the road rage, also began attacking him. Applicant told police \nbecause these men were now chasing him he ran and got his gun from his car. He pointed \nit at them. He said he feared for his life. When he realized they were no longer chasing \nhim, he left the scene. (GE 8) \nApplicant\u2019s son provided a statement to the police after the incident. He confirmed \nthere was a mutual road rage incident that occurred. While driving, his father retrieved \npepper spray and a hand gun from the glove box of the vehicle. When they stopped, a \nwoman exited the other vehicle and said she was calling the police. His father made \nharassing statements to the woman. Then a man, not involved in the road rage, who his \nson and others believed was trying to diffuse the situation, walked up to Applicant\u2019s car \nand his father reached into the vehicle and grabbed the pepper spray and spayed the \nman. Then his father attacked the man, took him to the ground, and began fighting him. \nHis son stated this man did not attempt to attack his father. While on the ground, another \nman came to the man\u2019s assistance, and kicked Applicant in the face. Applicant and the \nman on the ground continued fighting. The son was yelling at his father to stop fighting. \nHis father then kicked the man in the head. This man was able to get away and crossed \nthe street in retreat, where he collapsed. (GE 8) \nApplicant\u2019s son said his father then went back to his car, retrieved his gun and \npointed it at the second man who intervened and then pointed it at the first man. Applicant \nadmitted that when he went back for the gun there was a magazine in it with rounds and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhe chambered one round. He admitted seeing the man crawling away on his hands and\nknees. He walked up to him and could not see a knife, but yelled at him to drop it, while\npointing the gun at him. He then kicked the man in the head. Applicant was wearing boots\nthat had 4 one-inch plastic spikes in the toe. Applicant testified he wears the boots for\nprotection. He claimed that even though the man was crawling away he was still a threat.\nHis son\u2019s statement said that Applicant then ran back to the car, put the gun between the\ndriver\u2019s seat and the console and the pepper spray on the front seat and told his son they\nneeded to leave the area before the police arrive. (Tr. 76-117, 156-172; GE 8) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNumerous witness statements, including those with no direct interest in the case, \ncontradict Applicant\u2019s version of what happened and essentially corroborate his son\u2019s \nstatement. Applicant admitted that his initial statement to police was false. He denied that \nhe got pepper spray and the gun out of the car console while they were still driving, \ncontradicting what his son said. He believes the police coached or influenced his son\u2019s \nstatement. I did not find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible. (Tr. 34, 76-117; GE 8) \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged will not be considered for \ndisqualifying purposes, however, it may be considered in making a credibility \ndetermination, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis. \nA search of Applicant and his vehicle revealed one 40 caliber hollow-point bullet, \nblack gloves, three cans of mace, steel boots with spikes, a semi-automatic Glock gun, \nand two Glock magazines, one with 12 rounds and one with 13 rounds. Applicant testified \nthat he has hollow-point bullets because they will do the most damage. A regular bullet is \nnot as accurate or efficient. He explained the hollow-point bullet is the standard to protect \nyour life. (Tr. 174-175; GE 8) \nThere were a total of nine charges against Applicant. He testified his bail was over \na million dollars. He was in jail for two months and under house arrest for another eight \nmonths. In March 2015, he accepted a best-interest guilty plea to felony aggravated \nassault with a deadly weapon, and firearm possession. Adjudication was withheld on this \ncharge. The charges of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, a firearm, and improper \nexhibition of a dangerous weapon or firearm, were nolle prossed. Applicant was \nsentenced to four years of probation, ordered to meet with his probation officer monthly, \n50 hours of community service, and to pay $100 a month of court costs. He completed \nhis community service and his probation was terminated early in May 2017. Although \nApplicant\u2019s probation was terminated, no court documents were produced to show the \nfinal adjudication of the charge. It likely was dismissed, but I do not have the documents \nto corroborate the final disposition. Applicant testified that he pleaded guilty because he \nran out of money. He said he regretted the incident.

(Tr. 150; Answer to the SOR; AE \nA, B, C, D) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG & 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an\nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.\nApplicant was involved in minor offenses in 1990, 1991, 1993, 2002, and 2006. \nMost of the charges were either dismissed or nolle prossed. He was acquitted of the \noffenses that occurred in 1991 and was found guilty of the 1990 offenses. In 2008, he \nwas involved in an aggravated assault incident where the charges were dismissed. In \n2011, he was involved in an incident in a bar and was charged with aggravated assault. \nThe charge was nolle prossed after he agreed to complete community service. In 2014, \nhe was charged with felony aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and various other \ncharges. He plead guilty to the aggravated assault charge and adjudication was withheld \nuntil he completed certain court requirements. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited\nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution,\ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher\neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity\ninvolvement.\nApplicant has a history of criminal conduct that began with minor offenses, but his \nmore recent conduct in 2011 and 2014 is serious. Although much of his conduct has not \nculminated in convictions, his behavior is a cause of concern. His admissions and \nevidence indicate he was the instigator when he assaulted the manager of a bar in 2011. \nIn 2014, Applicant was charged and pleaded guilty to felony assault with a deadly \nweapon, a gun, but under a plea agreement the judge withheld adjudication. He was \nsentenced to four years of probation and community service, which he completed \nsuccessfully. He seems to believe that this exonerates him of any wrongdoing. It does \nnot. \nThere was a significant period of time, while serving in the military, that Applicant \ndid not have any criminal offenses. However, his conduct in 2011 and 2014 is a cause of \nconcern. I have considered all of the facts surrounding Applicant\u2019s conduct. I am not \nconvinced that he has addressed his behavior and taken responsibility for his conduct. \nBased on his history, there is insufficient evidence to find that his conduct happened under \nunique circumstances and it is unlikely to recur. His conduct casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 32(a) does not apply. \nThere is evidence of rehabilitation. Applicant went back to school to earn a \nmaster\u2019s degree and is involved in philanthropic projects. I have also considered the time \nthat has passed since his last criminal conduct. Although AG \u00b6 32(d) applies, it is not \nenough to overcome the concerns raised by his past criminal conduct. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing; . . .. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct was cross-alleged under Guideline E, personal \nconduct. Some of his conduct alleged under the criminal conduct guideline was minor, \nand did not result in an arrest, charge, or conviction. Although some of the offenses were \nnolle prossed or dismissed, his personal conduct alleged in the SOR is a security concern \nand the above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur.  \nThe same analysis under Guideline J applies under the personal conduct \nguideline. It appears Applicant is in a better emotional and mental state, but there is \ninsufficient evidence to conclude he has acknowledged his past behavior and adequately \naddressed it through counseling. I find the evidence is insufficient to conclude future \ninappropriate behavior is unlikely to recur. The above mitigating conditions do not apply. \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative interference concerning the standards in this guideline may be \nraised solely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \nApplicant was evaluated by a DOD-approved licensed psychologist in October \n2019. He was diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder with narcissistic traits. She \nconcluded that his personality disorder and narcissistic traits are a security concern, and \nshe has concerns about his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. His condition is \npervasive and unlikely to improve, and his prognosis is poor. I find the above disqualifying \ncondition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom psychological conditions. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 were \nconsidered: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan;  \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program\nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional;  \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation;  \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem.  \nThere is insufficient evidence to apply any of the above mitigating conditions. \nAlthough, Applicant\u2019s medical records indicated that he suffered from PTSD, he merely \nalluded to treatment he had to resolve it. He also mentioned he attended anger \nmanagement, but again no corroborating evidence was provided. There was no evidence \nof any of the following: that he is participating in a treatment program regarding his current \ndiagnosis, that there is a favorable prognosis, that his condition is under control or in \nremission, or there is a low probability of recurrence. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts. \nIn 2017, Applicant had his debts discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy because he \nwas unable to work after his 2014 arrest. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying condition. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant was arrested in 2014 and was unable to work, which resulted in him \nbeing unable to pay his debts. He is responsible for his actions, and his arrest was not \nbeyond his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. It does not appear that Applicant had any \nfinancial concerns prior to his arrest. It also appears that he currently pays his bills on \ntime and there are no other financial concerns raised. I find that his financial problems \nhappened under unique circumstances and are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1)\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E, F, I and J, in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant served honorably in the military, was decorated for his service, and \nprovided numerous positive statements from his past military and civilian performance \nreports and his philanthropic ventures. However, Applicant has not fully embraced his \nresponsibility for his past behavior. Of particulate note is that during both the 2011 and \n2014 incidents he lied to the police. Although adjudication was withheld on the most \nserious offense in 2014, it does not exonerate Applicant regarding his underlying \nbehavior, whether or not it ultimately resulted in a criminal conviction. He pleaded guilty \nto the offense. He was placed on probation for four years.

He was \nmarried from 1990 to 2009, and has two adult children from his first marriage. He has \nbeen married to his second wife since 2012.

(Item \n2 at 12-20) \nOn his SCA, Applicant referenced financial difficulties and noted that he sends \n$150 to a debt relief company every two weeks to pay down his accounts. (Item 2 at 39-\n41) Applicant discussed numerous specific debts during his background interview. (Item \n3 at 2-3)  \nThe SOR debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the \nSOR (Item 1), by credit reports from May 2019 and November 2019 (Items 4, 5), public \nrecords of two state tax liens (Item 6), and bankruptcy filings in 1990 (Item 7) and 2010 \n(Items 8, 9). \nApplicant indicated in his June 2019 background interview that he fell behind on \nhis debts after he was laid off in February 2019. However, he also indicated that he \nretained a debt relief company in November 2018, which was a few months before he \nwas laid off from that job. He indicated that he enrolled about $18,000 of debts into that \nplan, which required him to pay $300 a month for 48 months, from November 2018 \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthrough November 2022.

(Item 2, Item 3 at 4) \nThe delinquent debts alleged in the SOR total almost $36,000. In his answer to the \nSOR, Applicant admitted each allegation but provided no additional information (beyond \nthe earlier references to the debt relief program previously noted) concerning the status \nof his debts and whether they have been, or are being, paid or otherwise resolved. The \ndebts are detailed as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($10,879) is a charged-off account. (Items 4, 5) Applicant \nacknowledged the debt in his background interview. (Item 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b concerns a repossessed automobile. The amount alleged in the SOR \n($10,221) is the balance owed after the repossession. $814 was reported as past due on \nthe November 2019 credit report. A line item on that report indicated that it was \u201caffected \nby natural disaster.\u201d (Item 5) Applicant did not appear to address this debt in his interview, \nso there are no other details provided. (Item 3) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($2,156) and 1.d ($1,816) are charged-off debts to the same bank. \n(Item 5) Applicant acknowledged the debts in his background interview. (Item 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($1,540) is a debt placed for collection. SOR \u00b6 1.f ($740) is another \ndebt in collection, owed to the same collection agency. A bank is the original creditor. \n(Items 4, 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($415) is a charged-off debt. (Item 4, 5) Applicant indicated in his \ninterview that the debt was for food purchases. (Item 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h ($88) is a charged-off debt to a cable company. (Items 4, 5) Applicant \nadmitted the debt in his answer to the SOR, but indicated in his interview that he no longer \nowed the debt and did not intend to pay it. (Item 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($591) is a debt placed for collection. (Item 4) Applicant indicated in his \ninterview that he did not recognize the debt, but he admitted it in his answer. (Items 1, 3) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j ($5,816) and 1.k ($1,633) are two outstanding state tax liens, both \nentered against Applicant in 2012, in a state where he used to live. (Item 6) According to \nhis SCA, he moved to a new state in 2013, and has lived there since then. (Item 2 at 10) \nApplicant discussed these state tax liens in his background interview. They appear to \ndate from tax year 2009, when Applicant was audited and could not document certain \ndeductions. He said he had been on a payment plan from 2009 to 2018 but had to stop \nmaking payments due to other bills.

The bankruptcy was converted to Chapter 7 \nin May 2012, and was discharged a few months later. (SOR \u00b6 1.l) (Items 3, 8, 9) \nApplicant admitted each of the SOR allegations without comment. He provided no \ndocumentation about any efforts to pay or resolve any of his debts, either through the \ndebt relief program or otherwise. He provided no information about his current financial \nstability. He also did not respond to the FORM, so the only information about his financial \nsituation is taken from his background interview. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant has incurred numerous recent delinquencies and has filed for bankruptcy \ntwice before. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nIn his answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. He provided no \nadditional explanation beyond what he previously indicated in his interview about either \nthe origin of his debts, or what he is doing about them, to consider in mitigation. Nor did \nhe provide any documentation of either his efforts to resolve his debts, or about the \ncurrent state of his finances. Applicant did not provide sufficient information to apply any \nof the mitigating conditions in full. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s debts are ongoing, and continue to cast \ndoubt on his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. \nApplicant has some unemployment in his past, including brief unemployment in \nlate 2019, which he asserted impacted his finances and led him to pursue resolving his \ndebts with a debt relief company. Applicant is given some credit under AG \u00b6 20(b), as \nsome of his current debts may well stem from that job loss. However, he did not provide \nsufficient information to establish that he has taken reasonable action under the \ncircumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \nApplicant retained a debt relief service to assist him with his creditors, and \nindicated in his SCA and in his June 2019 background interview that he was paying them \n$300 a month. He gave no later indication that he had continued this practice, \ndocumented or otherwise, nor that his arrangement with that company had a positive \nimpact on his more recent finances. He did not establish that the company was a \n\u201clegitimate and credible source\u201d of financial counseling of the sort contemplated by AG \u00b6 \n20(c), nor did he establish that his debts are being resolved or are under control. AG \u00b6 \n20(c) does not apply. Similarly, he did not establish that he has undertaken good-faith \nefforts to repay his creditors or otherwise resolve his debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence \nto mitigate the security concern shown by his delinquent debts and his history of financial \ndifficulties. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant did \nnot provide sufficient information to mitigate the security concerns about his finances \nunder Guideline F. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Applicant also denied the medical collection debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.o) and the insurance debt (SOR \u00b6 1.n) as she did not recognize them.

On May 5, 2022, the case was assigned to me to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant. I received the case file and assignment on May 9, 2022. \nAfter some coordination with the parties, on June 10, 2022, I scheduled a video conference \nhearing for June 28, 2022. \nAt the hearing convened on June 28, 2022, four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) \nwere admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified, as reflected in a hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) received by DOHA on July 13, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges that, as of March 4, 2022, Applicant owed $13,539 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nand $334 (SOR \u00b6 1.l) in charged-off automobile-loan debts; $31,370 in federal student-loan \ndebts in collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.j and 1.q-1.t); $460 (SOR \u00b6 1.k) and $130 (SOR \u00b6 1.o) in \nmedical collection debts; a $297 charged-off credit-card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.m); a $159 car \ninsurance debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.l); and a $112 cellular-phone debt in collection (SOR \n\u00b6 1.p). When Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, she denied owing anything on \nthe automobile loans on the bases that she was told that she owed nothing on the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a after her car was repossessed and sold at auction, and the loan in SOR \u00b6 1.l \nwas paid off by insurance proceeds following a car accident. Applicant also denied the \nmedical collection debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.o) and the insurance debt (SOR \u00b6 1.n) as she \ndid not recognize them. She indicated that her account with the cellular-phone company \nwas current (SOR \u00b6 1.p). She admitted her defaulted student loans and credit-card debts. \nShe stated she would pay off the credit-card debt within the year. She provided no \ncorroborating documents to show that any debts had been resolved. \nBased on her admissions, I accept and incorporate as factual findings that Applicant \ndefaulted on the automobile loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a, the credit-card account in SOR \u00b6 1.m, and \nthe student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.j and 1.q-1. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, \nand transcript, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 30-year-old plan production control specialist who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since January 2019. (GE 1; Tr. 20, 24.) She did not do well \nacademically in high school until her senior year. Needing credits before her college of \nchoice would accept her as a transfer student, she took classes at several different \neducational institutions between June 2010 and December 2012. In January 2013, she \nmatriculated into the university at which she earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting in \nJune 2016. (GE 1; Tr. 20-21, 52.) Applicant has never married and has no children. She \ncurrently lives with her significant other of almost nine years.

She left her full-time job when offered a job in \nfinance. Although she was offered the position, she was ultimately not hired because of her \npoor credit. (Tr. 52-53.) Her only employment from March 2017 to July 2017 was as a part-\ntime server at a conference center. From July 2017 to November 2017, Applicant worked \nfull-time for an energy assessment company. She resigned from that job because she did \nnot like the nature of the work. She held a part-time position in data entry for two months in \nlate 2017 before becoming a payroll specialist for a medical staffing company in January \n2018 at $15 an hour. (GE 1; Tr. 26.) She left that job after one year due to issues with the \nwork environment. (GE 2.) \nIn January 2019, Applicant was hired by her current employer to work in a position \nthat requires a security clearance. (Tr. 23.) On January 16, 2019, she completed a \nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (SF 86) for a DOD security clearance. In \nresponse to the financial record inquiries concerning delinquency involving routine \naccounts, Applicant disclosed the vehicle loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.l, but indicated that \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l was resolved in August 2016. She explained that she was trying to \nsell the car financed with the loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a to settle the $14,000 debt. She listed no \nother past-due debts on her SF 86. (GE 1.) About two months into her employment, she \nwas granted an interim confidential security clearance. For the next 18 months or so, she \nmaintained the clearance with no issues until it was withdrawn in connection with this \npending adjudication. She has continued to work for her employer since then, but in a \nposition that does not require her to hold a clearance. (Tr. 23.) \nApplicant\u2019s January 31, 2019 credit report revealed significant additional debts \nbeyond the two car loans listed on her SF 86. The delinquency and payment histories of \nher past-due debts are shown in the following table. \nDebt in SOR \nDelinquency history \nPayment history \n1.a. $13,530 charged-off \nauto loan \nAuto loan obtained for about \n$24,000 in Aug. 2016 for a \n2012 model-year car (GE 2; \nTr. 28-29); payments of \nabout $450 per month; car \ninvoluntarily \nrepossessed \n(Tr. \n29, \n31); \n$18,883 \nbalance placed for collection \n(GE 3); after car sold at \nauction (GE 2; Tr. 31) \n$13,539 charged-off balance \nas of Oct. 2019.

No longer \non credit report as of Nov. \n2019 (GE 4), but no proof of \nsatisfaction. \nOn August 19, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant volunteered that she had federal \nstudent loans that were initially in her parents\u2019 names for which her wages were garnished \nin her previous job. She stated she did not list them on her SF 86 due to oversight. She \nwas not aware of the loans\u2019 current balances and was not sure if her wages were currently \nbeing garnished for the debts. Applicant attributed her defaults of the car loans listed on \nher SF 86 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.l) to having insufficient income to make her monthly car \npayments. She stated that the account in SOR \u00b6 1.l was resolved as she \u201ctotaled\u201d the \nvehicle and insurance paid the full loan balance so she should owe nothing on that loan. \nAs for the other vehicle, Applicant admitted that she had become $3,000 to $4,000 past \ndue in October 2017 before the car was auctioned off. She had taken a job at lower pay \nand could not afford to maintain her car payment. She expressed a plan to contact the \ncreditor and establish a repayment plan. (GE 2.) \nDuring her interview, Applicant was confronted with the adverse information on her \ncredit record. As for her student loans, she could provide no details but did not dispute the \ninformation showing they were in collections as of January 2019. Applicant admitted owing \nthe $130 medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.o), which she recalled as becoming delinquent in 2013 or \n2014. She did not recognize the $460 (SOR \u00b6 1.k), $159 (SOR \u00b6 1.n), or $112 (SOR \u00b6 1.p) \ncollection debts. She acknowledged owing the $297 credit-card delinquency and explained \nthat she forgot about the debt. She expressed a willingness and ability to pay her debts as \nher financial situation was good. (GE 2.) \nApplicant testified that her mother and stepfather applied (filled out the paperwork) \nfor the federal student loans for her education, and that she believed all the loans were in \nher parents\u2019 names. She also stated that about ten years ago, her parents transferred the \nfederal student loans into her name and did not inform her at that time. (Tr. 17-19.)

(Tr. 60.) When asked on cross-examination as to \nwhen she learned that the loans were seriously delinquent, she responded, \u201cSo long ago, a \nlong, long time ago.\u201d (Tr. 34.) She admitted that when she learned that she was \nresponsible for repaying them, she \u201cdid not do anything about it.\u201d She explained that, a few \nyears ago, her wages were garnished and some tax refunds were applied to her student \nloans. After her OPM interview, she looked up her student loans and they were all reported \nas closed accounts. She did not pursue any additional steps to inquire about the status of \nher student loans or their balances because she did not know what action to take or whom \nto contact about her loans. (Tr. 17-19, 34-35.) As to why she did not investigate her student \nloans further, especially after being placed on notice of the security concerns raised by the \ndelinquencies, Applicant responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just \u2014 anxiety. I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t \npay them.\u201d (Tr. 35.) Her wages are not currently being garnished for her student loans. (Tr. \n37.) \nAs for the car loan delinquency in SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant testified that she fully \nfinanced a 2012 model-year car for $24,000. After she missed one payment, she \u201cfell \nbehind from there,\u201d and the car was repossessed and then sold at auction. She explained \nthat she was told to come and pick up her belongings from the vehicle; that she called \ntwice and received no response. She said she never heard anything about the sale. When \nthen asked how she knew that she owed nothing on the loan, she responded, \nI guess I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t recall ever hearing back from them, so maybe I \njust assumed that everything was taken care of. Like I said, if they\u2019re going to \ntake the car back, why didn\u2019t I hear from them. . . and I reached out twice. I \nreached out two times. I called the towing company, and they didn\u2019t have it. I \nhad to call a different towing company because they didn\u2019t even tell me who \ntook it, and I just never heard back from anybody. (Tr. 31-33.) \nApplicant believes her student-loan delinquencies are hindering her career. She has \nnot been eligible for promotions at work, which would have increased her income, because \nof a lack of security clearance. (Tr. 19.) Her income of \u201ca little over $60,000 a year\u201d is \nbarely enough to cover her living expenses. (Tr. 19, 24.) She received bonuses from her \nemployer in April each year of her employment. For 2022, her bonus was $1,200. (Tr. 25.) \nIt went toward paying for car repair expenses of $2,300 incurred from an accident during \nthe winter. (Tr. 51.) \nApplicant\u2019s significant other is an electrician. His annual income is comparable to \nher income, so about $60,000-$65,000. They try to split household expenses evenly each \nmonth, although they cover for each other when necessary. During the COVID pandemic in \n2020, he was without any income for about four months. He has otherwise been \nconsistently employed. (Tr. 22-23.) \nIn June 2022, Applicant and her significant other moved in with a friend because of \na rent increase at their previous address. (Tr. 19, 37, 43.) They had been paying $2,200 \nper month in rent, which included utilities. They had yet to pay rent for their new living \nquarters. Applicant expects the rent to be between $900 and $1,200 a month, which will be \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsplit between her and her significant other.

She has nothing in savings and maintains \nabout $1,000 in her checking account. (Tr. 50-51.) She does not have any open credit-card \naccounts. Her only outstanding credit-card debt is the $297 on the closed credit-card \naccount (SOR \u00b6 1.m). (GE 4; Tr. 51-52.) She has not had any financial counseling. (Tr. 52.) \nShe expects to be able to pay $100 from each paycheck toward her student loans. (Tr. 38.) \nApplicant obtained a car loan of $16,974 in May 2019 for a 2013-model year \nvehicle. Her car payment is $445 per month. As of October 2019, the loan balance was \n$16,979, and she was making her car payments on time. (GE 4.) The interest rate on her \nloan is high, around 25%, due to her poor credit. (Tr. 46-47, 49.) Applicant has tried several \ntimes to refinance her car loan without success. (Tr. 49-50.) She owes about $12,000 on \nher car loan. (Tr. 49.) Her car insurance expense recently decreased from approximately \n$300 to $180 per month. (Tr. 47.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also  EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . .  \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual does not pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. Applicant does not dispute that she owes the $297 \ncharged-off credit-card debt or the federal student-loan delinquencies totaling \napproximately $31,370 as of January 2019. Applicant testified credibly that her wages had \nbeen garnished at her previous employment in 2018, but she did not provide any \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ndocumentation showing the amount garnished. In any event, the student loan balances in \nthe SOR are from 2019, and so post-date any garnishments and any interception of \nincome tax refunds in 2017 and 2018. Four student loan debts totaling $6,640 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.q-1.t) were no longer on her credit report by November 2019, but the record did not \nindicate whether those debts have been resolved or whether they have fallen off her credit \nreport for other reasons, such as transfer to a servicer not reporting the debt. Applicant no \nlonger disputes the validity of medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o or that she received the medical \nservices that led to the $460 charge in SOR \u00b6 1.k, although she contends that she was \novercharged in that instance as she was told the procedure would cost her $175. \nWhile Applicant admits she defaulted on the automobile loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a because \nshe could not afford to maintain the monthly payments on her income at the time, she \ndenied the debt when she answered the SOR on the basis that, after the car was \nrepossessed and sold at auction, she was told there was no outstanding debt owed. As of \nNovember 2019, the account was on her credit report with a $13,539 past-due balance. \nSimilarly, the disputed delinquencies for $334 (SOR \u00b6 1.l) and $159 (SOR \u00b6 1.n) were on \nher credit report as of November 2019. The disputed cellular-phone debt for $112 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.p) was on her credit report as of January 2019, although it was not on her November \n2019 credit report for reasons not indicated in the record. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government bears the burden of establishing controverted \nissues of fact. The Appeal Board has held that adverse information from a credit report can \nnormally meet the substantial evidence standard. See ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. \nBd. Aug. 25, 2015) (citing, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). \nThe inclusion of all of the SOR debts on one or both of the credit reports in evidence is \nsufficient to establish the delinquencies. Applicant\u2019s evidence falls short of disproving her \nlegal liability for the indebtedness. At her hearing, she admitted that other than the medical \ndebts, she made no effort to contact her creditors about the debts at issue in the SOR. \nAbout the car loan deficiency balance in SOR \u00b6 1.a, she is now not sure whether she was \ntold or she just assumed based on the repossession that she owed no outstanding \nbalance. That debt has been charged off, and there is no evidence of any collection efforts, \nso it may no longer be a source of undue financial pressure for Applicant. However, the \nfederal government is still entitled to consider the facts and circumstances surrounding an \napplicant\u2019s conduct in incurring the debt and failing to satisfy it in a timely manner. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03991 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 1, 2015). Her record of delinquency \nestablishes disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial delinquencies.\u201d \nApplicant bears the burden of mitigating the negative implications for her financial \njudgment raised by her proven delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying \nconditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. The \nfollowing are relevant to the issues in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot reasonably apply, even though the SOR debts were not incurred \nrecently. Applicant recently paid off the medical debt in SOR\u00b6 1.o, but the other SOR debts \nhave not been addressed. An applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing \ncourse of conduct and are considered recent. See, e.g., ISCR 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. \n31, 2018), citing, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08779 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2017). \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant\u2019s mother may not have been initially forthcoming \nwith Applicant about her responsibility for repaying the student loans. Nonetheless, \nApplicant admits that she learned a long time ago that she would have to begin repaying \nthem. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some applicability in that she could not afford to make student-loan \npayments over the 2017 and 2018 timeframe. As a payroll specialist for a staffing company \nin 2018, her hourly wage was only $15. Applicant acknowledges in hindsight that she \nprobably should not have taken on the car loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a in August 2016. See Tr. 27. \nThe evidence shows that she made payments for less than one year on the loan. Even so, \nthe car was a used vehicle, the loan was for a reasonable amount, and she was working at \nthe time. That debt was not caused by circumstances beyond her control, but low income \nwas a factor in the delinquency. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) requires for mitigation that an individual act responsibly under his or her \ncircumstances. A component of financial responsibility is whether Applicant maintained \ncontact with her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts \ncurrent or payment plans for resolution of debt balances. With the exception of the medical \ncollection debts, Applicant has done little over the last three years to investigate and \nattempt to address the debts at issue to the DOD. She was on notice as of her August \n2019 interview with the OPM investigator of the delinquencies on her credit report. She \nindicated at that time that the car loan debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a was not resolved and that she \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nneeded to work out a repayment plan. She indicated that she would repay the credit-card \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.m. She had not contacted either of these creditors, or most of her other \ncreditors for that matter, as of June 2022. She testified that she checked into her student \nloans online and saw that they were closed. She did not go further as she did not know \nwhat to do. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not mitigate her failure to educate herself about her status of \nher student loans and other debts, which continue to adversely affect her credit, as \nevidenced by the high interest rate on her current car loan. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are only applicable to the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o, which \nApplicant testified has been paid. The other debts in the SOR have not been resolved, and \nApplicant presently has no payment plans established for those debts. An applicant is not \nrequired to show that he or she has paid off each debt in the SOR, or that the debts in the \nSOR be paid first. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006). \nThat being said, the Appeal Board has also held that an applicant must demonstrate \n\u201ca plan for debt payment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that is, conduct that \nevidences a serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d See ADP Case No. 17-00263 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 19, 2018) (citing, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03889 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 9, 2018)). \nApplicant plans to give first priority to paying the $297 credit-card debt. A promise to pay a \ndebt at some future date is not a substitute for a track record of timely debt payments or \notherwise financially responsible behavior. See ISCR Case No, 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. \nSep. 2008). Applicant has not made enough progress toward resolving her old \ndelinquencies to apply AG \u00b6 20(c) or AG \u00b6 20(d). Moreover, she has not had financial \ncounseling, although since her college degree is in accounting, one would expect her to \nhave a better understanding of sound financial practices than she has displayed. \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(e), Applicant failed to substantiate her disputes of the medical \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.k, the car-loan debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l, the insurance debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n, or the \ncellular-phone debt in SOR \u00b6 1.p. She has the burden of showing that she was \novercharged for a medical procedure; that the car debt was satisfied by an insurer; and that \nher accounts with the insurance and cellphone companies have zero balances. She \nprovided no substantiating documentation, which is required under AG \u00b6 20(e). The \nfinancial considerations security concerns are not mitigated by conduct which Department \nCounsel aptly described as a \u201chead-in-the-sand response\u201d to her delinquent obligations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some \nof the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \nThe Appeal Board has held that the security clearance adjudication is not a \nproceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts. Rather, it is a proceeding \naimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness with regard to \nhis fitness or suitability to handle classified information appropriately. See ISCR Case No. \n09-02160 (App. Bd. June 21, 2010). It is not intended as punishment for past \nshortcomings. There is some evidence of financial responsibility in that Applicant is making \ntimely payments on her current car loan, and she does not have any open credit-card \naccounts. Her financial affairs are likely to improve in the future as her monthly expenses \nwill be lower with her recent move. \nAppendix C of Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4 grants DOHA \nadministrative judge\u2019s the discretionary authority to grant initial or continued eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance despite the presence of an issue(s) that can be partially but not \ncompletely mitigated with the provision of additional security measures. See, also, \nMemorandum, Director for Defense Intelligence (Intelligence and Security), dated January \n12, 2018, (\u201cAppendix C identifies authorized exceptions that are to be utilized when making \nadjudicative decisions to grant initial or continued eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive position. . . Effective immediately, authority to grant \nclearance eligibility with one of the exceptions enumerated within Appendix C is granted to \nany adjudicative, hearing, or appeal official or entity now authorized to grant clearance \neligibility when they have jurisdiction to render the eligibility determination.\u201d) \nAfter carefully considering and weighing the financial considerations security \nconcerns, I decline to exercise the discretionary authority under Appendix C at this time. \nIndividuals granted eligibility for access to classified information must be held to a standard \nof good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness which, at times, may require her or him to \nmake choices that are personally difficult or disadvantageous. Despite sharing her living \nexpenses with her cohabitant significant other and consistent annual income of \napproximately $60,000 for the past three years, Applicant was living from paycheck to \npaycheck as of June 2022 without a reasonable plan to address her delinquent debts. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. 1990). Based on the \nevidence of record, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nor continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant at this time. This decision should not \nbe construed as a determination that Applicant cannot in the future attain the reform \nnecessary to establish her security worthiness, especially if she is able to provide a track \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nrecord of financial stability and of timely payments on her debts, including her federal \nstudent loans.

(Tr. 55-57; GE 2-4) \nApplicant attributed his financial issues to his purchase of a healthcare business \nthat did not perform as expected. He and his wife purchased this business in about \nOctober 2013. He had some experience in the industry prior to the purchase. He paid \nabout $25,000 for the business, which he paid in monthly installments. He tapped into \nabout $10,000 of his retirement savings in order to pay for living expenses until the \nhealthcare business started making some money. He also borrowed money to pay for \nliving expenses. He owned the business for about three years. At some point while they \nowned it, licensing requirements stalled their ability to earn income. This lack of income \nand the amount of work the business required led him to sell the business in about 2016 \nfor $25,000. Despite selling the business, it left him in debt. (Tr. 25-34, GE 1, 2) \nAfter he sold the healthcare business, Applicant continued to work in the \nhealthcare industry, but he earned significantly less money ($8-$10 per hour) than he \nhad while working as a government contractor. He claimed that he tried to find a job in \naircraft maintenance, but was unable to find one until 2018. Applicant works between 40 \nand 60 hours per week. He earns $42.65 per hour and about $60 per hour for overtime. \nHe has earned between $40 and $60 per hour since April 2018. Last year, he took \nhome about $70,000 and his wife took home about $12,000. He takes home at least \n$5,000 per month. He has about $200 in a checking account and no money in his \nsavings account. He has a retirement account with a balance of about $13,000. He pays \nabout $1,200 per month for his daughter\u2019s college expenses. Applicant purchased a \nnew SUV for his wife in 2019 for $36,000. He pays $676 per month for this vehicle. \nApplicant purchased a new vehicle for his daughter sometime in the last two years. His \nmonthly payment on this vehicle is $421. Applicant was unable to testify accurately what \nhis monthly expenses are or whether he has a budget surplus at the end of each month. \nHe has never taken any credit counseling. (Tr. 24-25, 34-41, 69, 77) \nApplicant has at least two additional credit card accounts on which he is \ndelinquent that are not listed in the SOR.1 He claimed that, in the two weeks prior to the \nhearing, he made payment arrangements to bring these two accounts current in the \nfuture. He was also delinquent on his account for the aforementioned 2019 SUV in July \n2022, but claimed he is now current on that account. (Tr. 73-75, 79-80; GE 5) \nIn May 2021, Applicant sent a letter to Equifax disputing the debts listed in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a (withdrawn)-1.c. He did not provide a basis for his dispute. He did not provide \nevidence of the outcome of his claim.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has six debts that he has been delinquent on for years. All of these \ndelinquent debts remain unresolved. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c), thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nWhile he claimed to have paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.g, Applicant provided \nno documentary evidence of payments or favorable resolution of any of the SOR debts. \nIt is reasonable to expect Applicant to present documentation about the resolution of \nspecific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). He \ntherefore failed to show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances or that he \nmade a good-faith effort to repay or otherwise resolve the SOR debts. His purchase of \ntwo new vehicles despite being delinquent on the SOR debts further undermines any \nclaim that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. As he failed to provide a basis \nfor his dispute of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, or to provide documentary corroboration that he \npaid the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.g, he has not met the requirements of AG \u00b6 \n20(e). \nAs the SOR debts are unresolved, and Applicant has two additional credit-card \ndebts on which he is behind, his financial issues are ongoing. I cannot find that they are \nunlikely to recur. These two new delinquencies, the relatively insignificant amount of \nmoney he has in his bank accounts, and his lack of awareness of his overall budget \nalso give me pause about his financial stability. His financial issues continue to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The financial \nconsiderations security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                     \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nWithdrawn \nAgainst Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.b-1.g:                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

The presentation was \nstored on the network drive. (Tr. 18) When questioned by the security office, Applicant \nwas asked where he stored the presentation and he informed them that he stored it on \nthe network drive. The presentation was not stored on more than one computer. \nHowever, any computer connected to the network drive could access it. (Tr. 18-19) \nApplicant stated that the presentation did not contain any classified information. \nApplicant knows that to be true because he reviewed the information with the security \noffice, along with the Security Classification Guide for the program. Applicant and the \nsecurity office agreed that the information in question was not classified. (Tr. 19-20) \nApplicant did not actually download or save the presentation onto any computer. \nRather, he had created the presentation on his own computer and saved it only on an \nunclassified shared drive. (SOR Answer) When asked by the security office whether the \npresentation was on any other computers, Applicant perceived this question to relate to \nonly the downloading and saving of the presentation to a computer, not the mere \naccessing of the presentation on the shared drive via a computer. Therefore, he \nanswered in the negative, even though he had accessed the presentation on the shared \ndrive via a total of three computers. Applicant stated this was an honest \nmisunderstanding and interpreted the security office\u2019s inquiry in the literal sense. (SOR \nAnswer) \nApplicant stated that he never attempted to conceal the fact that he had \naccessed the presentation on three separate computers. He advised the security office \nthat the presentation was saved to an unclassified shared drive, and therefore would \nhave been accessible by multiple users from any network-connected drive. Applicant \nwas well aware that the company\u2019s computer security officials could easily and \nimmediately determine all users and/or devices that had accessed the presentation after \nit was saved to the unclassified shared drive. (SOR Answer) \nThe security office and Applicant noted that the questioned material had been \npublicly released and was readily accessible through open sources in the public \ndomain. Applicant received no follow-up from the security office on this matter. His \ncomputer was returned to him. He was not cited for a security infraction. Applicant\u2019s \npresentation still remains on the company unclassified shared drive, where he originally \nsaved it. (SOR Answer; Tr. 53-55) \nApplicant accessed this presentation on more than one company computer \nbecause the presentation was stored on a server. Sometimes, he would not be at his \nnormal workstation and when he found himself at different locations, he would pull the \npresentation from the server and review it. (Tr. 22) As a take away from this incident, \nApplicant has vowed to read the Security Classification Guide as the first order of \nbusiness before working on a particular new program. In a typical year, Applicant \ncreates \u201c[t]housands probably\u201d of presentations. (Tr. 20-21) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \u2013 Alleged that Applicant used a colleague\u2019s account to access a DoD \nclassified system after his account had lapsed. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted this allegation with explanation. On infrequent occasions, \nApplicant visited the company lab without having first obtaining a current group \npassword (i.e. the former group password has expired and Applicant had not yet gone \nthrough the administrative process to obtain the new one). Applicant was unsure of the \nexact date when this occurred, and on cross-examination settled on the approximate \ndate of 2013. On these infrequent occasions, a company colleague would log in to the \ngroup account on Applicant\u2019s behalf. (SOR Answer; Tr. 22-23, 25, 42-43) \nThe lab environment involved multiple cleared individuals who typically shared a \ncomputer or computers in a secure place. The practice of one person logging on with \nthe current group password and others doing the same was relatively common and an \naccepted practice of his coworkers. The Director of Integration and Testing, a company \ncolleague of Applicant, provided the following about the group account access practices \nin the lab: \nI worked with [Applicant] on the [program] from 2008-2017. [Applicant] had \nthe clearance and the need to know to view classified data associated with \nthe system. The program has many different computer accounts and \nsystems. Many of the computer labs had shared computers. Employees \nwere responsible for ensuring they kept the accounts up to date and \nremembering the latest group account password. Our satellite integration \nand test occurred at an offsite customer facility. For people in managerial \nroles and travelers to our site, like [Applicant], that only used these \nsystems occasionally; it was not unusual to have their account or \npassword not be up to date. In these labs with shared computers, it was \nnot unusual for one person to login on a group account or their account \nand have another person access or view test data (while the user was in \nthe room). This was considered acceptable as long as the person was \ncleared, had need to know and was authorized to view the data. (SOR \nAnswer (Tab D)) \nApplicant reiterated what Director of Integration and testing stated above during \nhis testimony. (Tr. 23-24) Applicant understands that password sharing of the sort \nmentioned above is not permitted and inappropriate, even in a group password and \ngroup account environment. He pledged to obtain and use a current group password on \nvisits to the company lab on all future occasions. He understands clearly that he must \npersonally obtain a current group password, and that it is improper for a colleague to log \ninto a group account on his behalf. Of note, there was an identical group password for \nall users of the group account. At all times in question, Applicant was eligible to obtain \nthe group password renewals. He held the proper clearance to access the group \naccount, and always had the need to know. (SOR Answer; Tr. 25-26) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 Alleged that Applicant used classified material that was removed \nwithout approval, and saved the product in two locations on an unclassified company \nserver. He did not report this incident to company security. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant denied this allegation with explanation. He explained that a cleared \ncolleague (CC) strictly followed all protocol and procedures for the transfer of \nunclassified data from a classified system (high side) to an unclassified system (low \nside). He properly exported the data from the high side to the low side, where he saved \nit. (SOR Answer; Tr. 26-27) Applicant was unsure of the timeframe when this occurred, \nstating it was \u201caround 2013 maybe. But since it\u2019s been so long, I don\u2019t remember the \nexact year. It was before 2015.\u201d (Tr. 30, 44)  \nAfter the data had been exported to the low side, Applicant included a portion of \nit in two presentations he created and saved on an unclassified company computer. \nWhen CC reviewed Applicant\u2019s presentation, he recommended that Applicant delete a \nsmall portion of it. CC knew the entire presentation was unclassified, but he believed the \naudience seeing the presentation might erroneously believe that the small portion was \nclassified, and he did not want to take presentation time to explain why the material was \nunclassified. Applicant deleted the small portion of the presentation, per CC\u2019s \nsuggestion. (SOR Answer; Tr. 27-29) CC states as follows: \nI worked with [Applicant] in the support of a program in which we analyzed \nperformance data of an electronics unit in the 2014 to 2016 time frame \nthat was saved on a classified system. The performance data was \nunclassified. OPSEC CONOPs was followed correctly to remove the \nunclassified data from the system. We were allowed to print unclassified \nplots, stamp them \u201cUNCLASS\u201d and take them outside the classified labs. \nThe data was unclassified when removed from the lab. Out of abundance \nof caution, additional security guidelines were taken into account as we \nprepared the plots of the data for presentation. The data was already \nunclassified, but this additional step made it more obvious the data was \nunclassified, allowing the presentation to be made without having to \nexplain why the data was unclassified. (SOR Answer (Tab D)) \nAs the above evidence indicates, no security violation occurred that required \nmaking a report to company security. Applicant stated that even though he did not \ncompromise any classified information and did not violate any policies, there is always \nmore one can do when it comes to security and protecting classified information. It is \nbetter to be even more \u201chyper-vigilant\u201d and take every possible precaution when it \ncomes to protecting classified information. (Tr. 29-39) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d \u2013 Alleged that between about 2009 to at least 2016 Applicant \naccessed a Government computer system without authorization once or twice a year. \nHe had \u201cviewing privileges\u201d only so he circumvented this by downloading test data to a \ncomputer he was not authorized to access and then having a colleague transfer data to \nhis computer. (Tr. 44-45) \nApplicant denied this allegation with explanation. He explained the situation \ndescribed in the SOR is not an altogether accurate depiction of the facts. Similar to the \nsituation described in SOR \u00b6 1.b, above., Applicant held the proper clearance to access \nthe classified systems in question.

However, he had not gone through the administrative process to obtain the \nmost recent group password for the group accounts involved. In this instance, Applicant \nwas visiting a company site in another city, and the person responsible for providing \nupdated passwords was absent from the office on the day in question. (SOR Answer; \nTr. 30-31) \nThe testing data involved in this situation was unclassified. Applicant needed to \nperform data analysis on the relevant unclassified testing data. The unclassified testing \ndata resided on the \u201cfirst classified system,\u201d but this system did not offer the analytical \ntools Applicant needed to properly process the data. A \u201csecond classified system\u201d \noffered these tools. (SOR Answer) Applicant asked his colleague to transfer the relevant \nunclassified testing data from the \u201cfirst classified system\u201d (the one without the analytical \ntools he needed) to the \u201csecond classified system\u201d (the one with the analytical tools he \nneeded). This transfer did not require Applicant to access the \u201cfirst classified system,\u201d \nand he did not do so. Once the unclassified testing data was transferred to the \u201csecond \nclassified system,\u201d Applicant performed analysis using the tools offered by \u201csecond \nclassified system.\u201d (SOR Answer; Tr. 31) \nApplicant was properly cleared to access both the \u201cfirst classified system\u201d and \nthe \u201csecond classified system.\u201d However, he had not administratively obtained an \nupdated group password for either system. His colleague logged on to the \u201csecond \nclassified system\u201d on his behalf, so that Applicant could access and analyze the \nunclassified testing data that had been transferred from the \u201cfirst classified system.\u201d \n(SOR Answer; Tr. 32) The allegation that Applicant accessed a Government computer \nsystem without authorization once or twice a year is not true, because Applicant was \ncleared and had a need to know that information. (Tr. 32) \nThe \u201csecond classified system\u201d was not Applicant\u2019s computer, as stated in the \nSOR. The two \u201csystems\u201d were not computers, but rather they were group accounts on \nclassified systems accessible via a current group password. (SOR Answer) Applicant \nperformed analysis of the unclassified testing data on the \u201csecond classified system.\u201d \nHe did not remove any of the unclassified testing data from the \u201csecond classified \nsystem\u201d when he did so. (SOR Answer; Tr. 32-34) Applicant has not had a similar \nsituation occur like this \u201csince 2016.\u201d (Tr. 33) Applicant learned as a take away from this \nevent that everyone allowed into the facility would be required to know the group \nusername and password as an additional safeguard to protect classified information. \n(Tr. 34-35) \nApplicant reiterated throughout his testimony that these incidents have instilled in \nhim a heightened sense of security awareness. (Tr. 20-22, 29, 34-35) Applicant has \nsince taken numerous security training courses, and submitted seven certificates of \ncompletion for various security training courses. (Tr. 21, 35-36, 38; AE O) \nThe Government cross-alleged the use of information technology concern raised \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d as an additional handling protected information allegation \nunder SOR \u00b6 2.a.

(Tr. 36) \nApplicant stated that he never engaged in behavior that resulted in the compromise of \nclassified material. (Tr. 36) Applicant\u2019s company never found that he failed to properly \nfollow its policies, regulations, procedures, or mishandled classified material. (Tr. 36) \nNor did his company find that Applicant misused any information technology. (Tr. 37) \nFurthermore, Applicant\u2019s company never determined that he lied or lacked candor when \nexplaining or discussing these events with them. (Tr. 37) None of these SOR allegations \nled to Applicant being disciplined by his company. (Tr. 37) \nApplicant has since taken a behavior modification course following these \nincidents to avoid making similar mistakes in the future. He learned how one\u2019s \npersonality can effect one\u2019s behavior. He realized that his persona is very \u201ctask \noriented\u201d and \u201cgoal oriented,\u201d which resulted in him being more focused on getting the \njob done. He recognizes that he must remain \u201cmore hyper-vigilant\u201d when it comes to \nusing security precautions and avoid lapses such as not taking the proper care to know \nhis password. (Tr. 37-38) Applicant submitted a Certificate of Completion dated April 18, \n2021, to document his having completed a four-hour behavior modification class and \npassing a written knowledge assessment. (AE N) \nNon-Alleged Conduct \nApplicant was denied clearances in 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2018. In 2009, \nApplicant was granted a clearance. His most recent SF-86 was dated February 3, 2018, \nand was his ten-year renewal application for that 2009 clearance. However, while \nholding that clearance, at the request of his employer, Applicant applied for eligibility to \naccess sensitive compartmented information (SCI). This SCI access was on a restricted \ncustomer project in Another Government Agency (AGA). The AGA denied Applicant\u2019s \naccess to SCI, and on April 2, 2018, notified him by letter identifying the reasons for \ntheir denial. (Tr. 45-49, 52; GE 1, GE 3, GE 4) \nApplicant\u2019s 2004, 2006, and 2008 denials appear to have been based primarily \non minimizing his high school illegal drug use.

He committed to take whatever additional steps are required to avoid any \ncompromise of classified material if granted a clearance. (Tr. 40-41) \nApplicant submitted four character letters, all from company employees who \nhave known him for lengthy periods of time.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology \nAG \u00b6 39 describes the security concern about use of information technology: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any component, \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, \nsoftware, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations.  \nAG \u00b6 40 provides several conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying: \n(a) unauthorized entry into any information technology system;  \n(b) unauthorized modification, destruction, or manipulation of, or \ndenial of access to, an information technology system or any data in such\na system;  \n \n(c) use of any information technology system to gain unauthorized \naccess to another system or to a compartmented area within the same \nsystem;  \n(d) downloading, storing, or transmitting classified, sensitive, \nproprietary, or other protected information on or to any unauthorized \ninformation technology system;  \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system;  \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, \nsoftware, or media to or from any information technology system when \nprohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when \notherwise not authorized;  \n(g) negligence or lax security practices in handling information \ntechnology that persists despite counseling by management; and  \n(h) any misuse of information technology, whether deliberate or \nnegligent, that results in damage to the national security. \nThe evidence of record raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 40(a), 40(c), 40(d), 40(e), and 40(f). \nConsideration of mitigating conditions is required. \nAG \u00b6 41 lists several conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness;  \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification to \nappropriate personnel; and  \n(d) the misuse was due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions. \nMitigation Applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.a. AG \u00b6 41(a) is applicable. Applicant created \nthe presentation over five years ago. Someone who viewed the presentation thought it \ncontained classified information. However, a review by the company security office \ndetermined that the presentation was unclassified. Furthermore, Applicant did not \nintentionally conceal the fact that he had accessed the presentation via a total of three \ncomputers. A security official asked him whether the presentation was on any other \ncomputers. Given the fact that Applicant had not downloaded and saved the \npresentation to any of the three computers, he honestly thought his negative response \nwas an accurate one. However, the computers could have saved the presentations on \nall computers where it was viewed through automatic saving processes.  \nMitigation Applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.b. AG \u00b6 41(a) is applicable. Applicant was \nproperly cleared for the group account, and to possess a group password. In this \nsituation, the previous group password had expired and Applicant had not yet gone \nthrough the administrative process to obtain the new group password. Additionally, the \nlab environment involved multiple cleared individuals who typically shared a computer \nor computers in a secure space. The practice of one person logging on with the group \npassword, and others piggy-backing onto the log-on, was a relatively common one. This \npractice has since stopped. Applicant understands clearly that he must personally \nobtain a new group password on all occasions going forward, rather than having a \ncolleague log into a group account on his behalf. In some classified environments, \nsomeone with a password will access a computer system, and allow someone with \nauthorization of the appropriate classification level to use the computer system without \nknowing the password. This process limits the access to the system when the password \nholder is not present. (This is used in the SCIF at military commissions.) \nAG \u00b6 41(b) is partially applicable. Applicant visited the lab infrequently, and held \nthe proper security clearance to access the group account. He also had an official \npurpose for accessing the account. He was eligible to obtain the group password, which \nwas identical for everyone who possessed it. \nAG \u00b6 41(d) is applicable. Given the Director of Integration and Testing\u2019s \nstatement that \u201cit was not unusual for one person to login on a group account or their \naccount and have another person access or view the data,\u201d it is clear that the \ncompany\u2019s instruction and training was lacking, unless there is a separate log-in \nprocedure where users with access, and the time of access are preserved. In this \nregard, the company has apparently since modified its InfoSec training, to make it clear \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nthat \u201cpiggy-backing\u201d on, the password of another, even in a situation involving a group \naccount and an identical group password, is not permitted. \nSince this issue came to light, Applicant has been very careful about his access \nto any group account, and about the importance of personally maintaining his own \ncurrent passwords. He has since completed numerous security training courses. \nApplicant demonstrated a positive attitude towards maintaining proper security \npractices. \nMitigation Applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.c. AG \u00b6 41(a) is applicable. Cleared colleague \n(CC) correctly exported the unclassified data from the high-side to the low-side. \nApplicant included a portion of the data in his presentations. CC did not suggest that \nApplicant remove the questioned data from the presentations because he believed it \nwas classified. Rather, he did so because he thought that someone in the audience \nmight erroneously believe the data was classified, and he did not want to use \npresentation time explaining why the data was unclassified. No violation occurred here. \nMitigation Applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.d. AG \u00b6 41(a) is applicable. Applicant held the \nproper clearance to access both classified systems, and he was eligible to obtain an\nupdated group password. The previous group password had expired, and Applicant was\nunable to obtain an updated group password in time for his visit to the company site, as\nthe company employee responsible for supplying updated group passwords was absent\non the day in question. \n \n \n \n \nSimilar to the situation with the lab, described above, the practice of one person logging \non with the group password, and others piggy-backing onto that log on, was a common \none at that site. This practice has since stopped. Applicant understands clearly that he \nmust personally obtain the current group password for any systems he accesses, rather \nthan having a colleague login to a group account on his behalf. \nAG \u00b6 41(b) is applicable. Applicant was visiting a remote company site, and held \nthe proper clearance for accessing the relevant materials in both systems. He had an \nofficial purpose for accessing the unclassified testing data, and he was eligible to obtain \nthe updated group password which was identical for everyone who possessed it. No \nviolation with respect to Applicant\u2019s accessing of the classified testing data occurred. \nThe data was unclassified and was properly transferred from one system to another. \nMoreover, Applicant was authorized to access and analyze the data. \nAG \u00b6 41(d) is applicable. The evidence suggests that the company\u2019s instruction \nand training on this point needed to be improved. Applicant advised that the company \nhas modified its corporate OPSEC training, to make it clear that the \u201cpiggy-backing\u201d on \nthe password of another, even in a situation involving a group account and an identical \ngroup password, is inappropriate and not permitted. Since this issue came to light, \nApplicant has been exceedingly careful about accessing any group account, and about \nmaintaining current group passwords. As noted, he recently completed security, CI, and \nInfoSec training, and he maintains a positive attitude toward all security responsibilities \nand requirements. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant apologized for any lapses in exercising the appropriate level of security \nawareness described above and gave assurances nothing like this will happen in the \nfuture. The last incident of any such lapse occurred in approximately 2016, more than \nfive years before his hearing. \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \nAG \u00b6 33 described the security concern about handling protected information: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information-raises doubt \nabout an individual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness \nand ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious security \nconcern.  \nAG \u00b6 34 provides several conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying: \n(a) deliberate or negligent disclosure of protected information to \nunauthorized persons, including, but not limited to, personal or business \ncontacts, the media, or persons present at seminars, meetings, or \nconferences;  \n(b) collecting or storing protected information in any unauthorized location; \n(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise \nhandling protected information, including images, on any unauthorized \nequipment or medium;  \n(d) inappropriate efforts to obtain or view protected information outside\none's need to know;  \n \n(e) copying or modifying protected information in an unauthorized manner \ndesigned to conceal or remove classification or other document control \nmarkings;  \n(f) viewing or downloading information from a secure system when the \ninformation is beyond the individual's need-to-know;  \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or \nsensitive information;  \n(h) negligence or lax security practices that persist despite counseling by \nmanagement; and  \n13 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(i) failure to comply with rules or regulations that results in damage to the \nnational security, regardless of whether it was deliberate or negligent. \nThe potential disqualifying conditions under this concern raised by the record \nevidence are AG \u00b6\u00b6 34(c) and 34(g). Consideration of mitigating conditions is required. \nAG \u00b6 35 41 lists several conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or \nunclear instructions; and  \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR responses under this concern are identical and applicable to \nthose under Use of Information Technology. The discussion and analysis under Use of \nInformation Technology, above, is applicable under this section. Hence, the analysis \nunder this section will be limited to identifying applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline for each of the SOR \u00b6 2.a cross-allegations from SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d. \nMitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 35(a) and 35(d) are applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nMitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 35(a), 35(b), 35(c), and 35(d) are applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nMitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 35(a) and 35(d) are applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.c. Mitigating \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 35(b), 35(c), and 35(d) are applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nWhole-Person Concept  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination whether to grant national security eligibility must be an \noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and \nthe whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion under Guidelines M and K are \nincorporated in this whole-person section. However, further comments are warranted. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old director of engineering employed by a defense \ncontractor since July 2003. He has a distinguished academic record and professional \ncareer. He is a highly valued employee and is the recipient of numerous awards. In that \nregard, his company had enough confidence in him to promote him to director of \nengineering where he supervises over 100 employees. Applicant was granted a \nclearance shortly after he was hired in 2003 and later in 2009. During the past 18 years \nplus as a defense contractor and apart from past clearance issues, Applicant has been \nan exemplary employee. Applicant\u2019s employer and colleagues fully support him. \nAdmittedly, Applicant has had some unfavorable clearance history. However, in \n2009, he was granted a clearance and while he held that clearance, he applied for SCI \naccess to work on a project for an AGA customer. That access was denied in 2018. The \nbasis of that AGA denial led to the current SOR allegations, which as discussed above, \nApplicant successfully mitigated. \nAs noted, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to add a personal \nconduction allegation, a motion I denied. That personal conduct is described in \nApplicant\u2019s January 17, 2019 OPM statement (GE 2), but was not alleged in his \nFebruary 2, 2021 SOR. The Government was aware of potential personal conduct \nissues and chose not to allege them in the SOR or at any time up to his May 17, 2021 \nhearing. I denied the motion to amend primarily out of fundamental fairness concerns, \nthat is, Applicant did not have sufficient notice to enable him to fully address the \nallegation. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board \nlisted five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered, \nstating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines \nis applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3. \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)).

The added responsibility of being a parent has most \nlikely contributed to his increased maturity. Applicant is an involved and engaged parent \nfor his two minor children. No doubt this experience has been a teachable moment for \nApplicant. He is committed to following all rules and regulations pertaining to security \nawareness. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline M: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline K: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

He \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 1, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). \nApplicant responded to the SOR on September 4, 2021, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. On November 5, 2021, the CAF amended the SOR detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline B (foreign influence). Applicant responded to the \namended SOR on November 25, 2021. \nThe case was assigned to me on June 3, 2022. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on July 26, 2022. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in \nevidence without objection. GE 5 (discovery letter, November 5, 2021) and GE 6 (Request \nfor Administrative Notice - the Republic of the Philippines (Philippines)) were marked and \nmade part of the record, but they are not substantive evidence. Applicant testified, \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npresented a witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1 through 5, which were \nadmitted without objection. I received AE 5 post-hearing. \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout the Philippines. Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts \ncontained in the request. The facts are summarized in the written request and will not be \nrepeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note is the significant threat of terrorism, \ncrime, and ongoing human rights problems in the Philippines. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He completed high \nschool in 1993, and has attended college on and off through the years, accumulating \nabout 60 college credits. (Tr. 5, 6) He enlisted in the military in 1993 and served on active \nduty until October 2012. He was honorably retired as an E-7. (Tr. 20 - 21) While in the \nservice, he held a top-secret clearance that was continued after his retirement. Applicant \nstated he had an impeccable record during his service. (Tr. 7, 8, 22) \nApplicant married his first wife in 1998 and divorced in 2003. He has a son, age \n23, of this marriage. His ex-wife was born in the Philippines. He maintains limited contact \nwith her, mostly to discuss issues concerning their son. \nApplicant married his current wife in 2013. She was born in the Philippines to \nPhilippine parents. He met his wife in the United States while she was working in a retail \nstore. When they met, she was already a naturalized U.S. citizen. Her three children, ages \n23, 28, and 30, were born in the Philippines. Her son and one daughter are living in the \nUnited States. The second daughter is a resident of the Philippines. He testified he always \nhad limited contact and no father role with his wife\u2019s children. (Tr. 22, 30 - 31; GE 1, 2) \nIn 2018, Applicant and his wife visited her relatives in the Philippines. This was his \nfirst visit to the Philippines and met her father and children. He has had no contact \n(physical or verbal) with her father after the 2018 visit. Between 2013 and 2016, Applicant \nprovided financial assistance (about $250 per month) to his stepdaughters in the \nPhilippines. The money was to assist them with their expenses while in school. Applicant \nhas not provided any financial assistance to his stepdaughters since 2016, except for \nsmall presents during special occasions. He has provided limited financial assistance to \nhis stepson who has been living with Applicant\u2019s son while in college. Two of his \nstepchildren are currently U.S. residents. He does not know whether any of his \nstepchildren are naturalized U.S. citizens. \nApplicant testified that in 2019, he and his wife determined that their marriage was \nnot working out and they are considering a divorce. They stopped living together in April \n2022 when their house rental contract ended. He is waiting for the statutory separation \nperiod to lapse to file for divorce. (Tr. 32) \nAs amended, the SOR alleges that Applicant: is indebted to the IRS for $11,617 \nfor tax year (TY) 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); failed to timely file his federal and state income tax \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nreturns for TYs 2016, 2017, and 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); owed a bank $55,136 for a delinquent \n2014 loan (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and owed another bank $2,446 for a delinquent credit-card \naccount (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Under Guideline B, it alleges that his father-in-law (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and \ntwo stepchildren are citizens and residents of the Philippines, and that he provides $250 \nmonthly in financial support to his stepchildren (SOR \u00b6 2.b). He denied all of the financial \nallegations and admitted the foreign influence allegations with explanations. \nApplicant blames his wife for his financial problems and for him not filing his income \ntax returns on time. He explained that while unemployed after his retirement, she would \nwithdraw $1,000 from their joint checking account without giving him prior notice. (Tr. 37 \n-38) He testified that she refused to provide him with documents and information he \nrequired to file his income tax returns, and refused to file income tax returns with him. (Tr. \n83 \u2013 84) \nConcerning his TY 2015 debt to the IRS, Applicant explained his wife refused to \nsign the income tax return as a joint return and he had to file as married filing separate. \nThe change in filing status caused an increase in his tax liability. In March 2021, he \nconvinced his wife to file amended income tax returns for TYs 2015 and 2017 as married \nfiling jointly, and he filed them both. He believes that when the IRS approves the amended \ntax returns, his tax liability will be reduced. \nAccording to Applicant and his accountant, he owes the IRS $1,456 for TY 2015; \nhe received a refund of $2,028 for TY 2017; he owes $2,190 for TY 2018; $6,978 for TY \n2019; and $10,034 for TY 2020; for a total balance of past due Federal taxes of \n$18,639.00. (AE 5) For state A, Applicant owes $1,094 in income taxes for TY 2015; and \n$1,525 for TY 2017. For state B, he owes $6,015 in income taxes for TY 2018; $3,254 for \nTY 2019; and $1,850 for TY 2020. (AE 5) Most of these facts were not alleged in the \nSOR. As such, I will only consider these facts to determine the possible applicability of \nthe mitigating conditions. \nApplicant claimed he verified the balances he owes per TY with an IRS \nrepresentative in August 2022. He stated he entered into a payment plan with the IRS\npromising to pay a minimum of $500.00 each month. His intent is to pay $1,000.00 each\nmonth to resolve his tax debt in the shortest period possible. As of his August 12, 2022\nemail, he had not received the approved IRS payment plan in the mail. He did not present\ndocumentary evidence to corroborate the IRS accepted his TY 2015 amended income\ntax return or that he has an IRS approved payment plan for his outstanding tax debt. \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant claimed that he timely filed his TYs 2018 and 2019 income tax returns \nand the IRS rejected them because of problems with his TYs 2015 and 2017 income tax \nreturns. I note that the IRS Wage and Income Transcript for TY 2018 shows that as of \nApril 15, 2019, he had not filed his TY 2018 income tax return. Applicant\u2019s documentary \nevidence shows that his accountant filed his TYs 2018 and 2019 income tax returns in \nMarch 2021. (See Answer to the SOR; Tr. 80 \u2013 81; AE 5) \nApplicant submitted an August 2022 letter from his accountant indicating that he \nhad just prepared Applicant\u2019s income tax return for TY 2021. Applicant testified he did not \n3 \n\n \n \napply for or receive an extension to file, so his filing would be late. (Tr. 79 - 80) The \naccountant stated Applicant would owe the IRS $6,000 and his state $1,600 for TY 2021. \nApplicant claimed he had saved $22,000 to pay his delinquent income taxes. He intended \nto use $7,600 to pay his TY 2021 taxes, and reserved $14,400 to pay delinquent taxes \nfor prior years. Applicant presented no documentary evidence to show he had saved \n$22,000 or that he paid his TY 2021 income taxes. (AE 5) \nWhen asked why it took him so long to address his delinquent income taxes, \nApplicant claimed he had been addressing other delinquent debts first and did not have \nthe resources to pay all the debts at the same time. (Tr. 62) His current income is $94,000 \na year. He has been earning over $90,000 a year since 2016. (Tr. 25 - 26) Additionally, \nhe receives $2,000 per month from his retired pension and $1,200 per month from \ndisability pay. (Tr. 28) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleged that Applicant owed a bank $55,136 for a delinquent 2014 \nconsolidation loan. Applicant took the loan to consolidate debts that accumulated during \nhis service. He retired from the military in October 2014 and was not able to find \nemployment until February 2015, which caused him to default on the loan. The creditor \nobtained a judgment against Applicant that was later placed for collection and then \ncharged off. He settled the debt for $25,000 on May 13, 2021, after he received the SOR \nin June 2020. (Tr. 54, 58; SOR Answer) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleged that Applicant owed a bank $2,446 for a delinquent joint credit-\ncard account he opened in 2012. The account became delinquent in 2015, and was \ncharged off. Applicant contacted the creditor in May 2021, established a payment plan, \nand paid it off in February 2022. (SOR Answer) \nApplicant stated that he received training during his military career to prevent \nfinancial problems. Throughout his entire military career, Applicant knew how important it \nwas to maintain good credit and establish a track record of financial responsibility to \nmaintain security clearance eligibility. (Tr. 23) \nApplicant highlighted his military service and expressed his undivided loyalty to the \nUnited States. He was deployed eight times with most of those deployments to combat \nor dangerous zones in the Middle East. (Tr. 27) He credibly testified that his in-laws and \nstepchildren in the Philippines could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing \nclassified information, and that he would report any attempt to do so. (Tr. at 35, 40, 50-\n51) \nApplicant\u2019s witness testified that he met Applicant six year ago at a cigar lounge \nwhile smoking a cigar. He considers Applicant to be a very close confidant and friend, \nand he trusts him implicitly. He trusts Applicant with his life. He believes Applicant is a \npatriot that he is loyal to the United States, and he would never betray the security of the \nUnited States. (Tr. 92 \u2013 93) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nApplicant is indebted to the IRS for delinquent income taxes for TY 2015. If the \nIRS accepts his TY 2015 amended income tax return, he will be indebted to the IRS for \nabout $1,456. If it is not accepted, he will owe the IRS $11,617. Regardless of the amount \nowed, he has owed TY 2015 income taxes to the IRS since they were due in 2016. Other \nthan filing an amended income tax return for TY 2015 in March 2021, Applicant presented \nno documentary evidence of any contacts with the IRS or of any payments made towards \nhis TY 2015 income taxes since they became due. Additionally, Applicant failed to timely \nfile his TY 2018 income tax return. It was filed by his accountant on March 23, 2021. \nConcerning the charged-off loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, Applicant took the loan in \n2014 to consolidate debts that accumulated during his service. He retired from the military \nin October 2014 and was unemployed for four months. He defaulted on the loan in 2015. \nThe creditor obtained a judgment against Applicant that went unpaid, and it was placed \nfor collection, and then charged off. Applicant settled the debt for $25,000 on May 13, \n2021, after he received the SOR in June 2020. Applicant presented no documentary \nevidence to show any efforts to contact the creditor, make payments, or establish a \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npayment agreement to settle or resolve this debt from the date it became delinquent in \n2015, until May 2021. \nRegarding the $2,446 charged-off credit-card account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, \nApplicant opened the joint account in 2012 and defaulted on it in 2015. He settled the \naccount in May 2021 and paid it off in February 2022. He presented no documentary \nevidence to show any efforts to contact the creditor, make payments, or establish a \npayment agreement to settle or resolve this debt from 2015 until May 2021. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns . . . or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The \nrecord established these disqualifying conditions, requiring additional inquiry about the \npossible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to a four-month period of unemployment \nafter he retired from the military, his wife\u2019s refusal to provide documents and information \nhe required to file his tax returns, and her reluctance to sign his income tax returns as \nmarried filing jointly, which caused him to change his tax filing status and increased his \ntax liability. \nI have considered as a circumstance beyond Applicant\u2019s control his period of \nunemployment. I do not find his wife\u2019s refusal to provide him with documents or tax \ninformation, and to sign Applicant\u2019s income tax returns as a valid excuse for him to file \nlate his income tax returns. Her refusal to sign his income tax returns could have \nadversely affected his ability to timely file, but only for a short period. It was Applicant\u2019s \nresponsibility and legal obligation to timely file his income tax returns. If she refused to \nsign his income tax returns, Applicant should have filed under a different filing status. \nApplicant was required to timely pay his TY 2015 income taxes. He failed to \npresent evidence of his efforts to pay his delinquent taxes. He only presented testimony \nof his efforts to convince his wife to refile his TY 2015 income tax return as married filing \njointly. It took Applicant six years to file an amended return for TY 2015. He presented no \ndocumentary evidence of any payments made, of efforts to contact the IRS to settle or to \nestablish a payment plan to pay his delinquent TY 2015 income taxes until 2021. \nApplicant submitted his SCA in 2018 and disclosed his financial problems; he was \nquestioned about his taxes during his October 2018 background interview, and was \nissued the SOR in June 2020. Notwithstanding, he delayed filing his amended federal \nincome tax return for TYs 2015 until March 2021. He claimed he talked with an IRS \nrepresentative sometime in August 2022, and that he is working on a payment plan with \nthe IRS to pay his delinquent taxes. He presented no documentary evidence to \ncorroborate his claims. Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to establish that he has been \nfinancially responsible under the circumstances. \nBecause of his military service and years working for federal contractors while \npossessing a clearance, Applicant knew or should have known of the security concerns \nraised by his failure to timely file income tax returns and to pay his taxes. Notwithstanding, \nhe did nothing to file his delinquent TY 2018 federal income tax returns until March 2021. \nAs of August 2022, had not established a payment plan with the IRS to pay his delinquent \ntaxes. \n8 \n\nAbout the failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns, the DOHA \nAppeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR \nCase No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nThe record evidence shows that Applicant has a problem complying with \ngovernment rules, regulations, and systems. He failed to establish full mitigation of the \nfinancial considerations security concerns. I am unable to find that Applicant acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to timely file his \nincome tax returns or pay his taxes. Applicant\u2019s financial issues are recent and ongoing. \nThey continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law and one stepdaughter are citizens and residents of the \nPhilippines. The potential for terrorist, crime, and other violence against U.S. interests \nand citizens remains high in the Philippines, and it continues to have human rights \nproblems. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest and a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. \nThe above disqualifying conditions have been raised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \nand \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. The United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding sensitive information from \nany person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless \nof whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the \nUnited States. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we \nknow friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in \nthe economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to the Philippines. Applicant has limited \nphysical and verbal contact with his wife\u2019s father and children. He visited the Philippines \nonly once in 2018. His wife, although born in the Philippines, was a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen when Applicant met her and later married her. His stepson and one of the \nstepdaughters live in the United States. Applicant stopped providing financial support to \nhis stepchildren in 2016, although, he continues to provide some financial support to his \nstepson who is attending college in the United States. \nApplicant is a U.S. citizen by birth. He served over 20 years in the military and has \nworked for federal contractors since 2015. He expressed his undivided allegiance to the \nUnited States. He credibly testified that he and his wife are having difficulties maintaining \ntheir marriage and are planning a divorce in the near future. He has never been close to \nhis stepchildren. His wife\u2019s family in the Philippines could not be used to coerce or \nintimidate him into revealing classified information. \nI find that Applicant\u2019s ties to the Philippines and his wife\u2019s family there are \noutweighed by his deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in the United States. \nIt is unlikely he will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of \nthe United States and the interests of the Philippines. There is no conflict of interest, \nbecause he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United \nStates. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are applicable. I find the Guideline B security concerns for \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and B in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nmilitary service, his work for a federal contractor, and his favorable character evidence. \nNonetheless, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe foreign influence security concerns, but he failed to mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n12 \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 25, 2004, June 5, 2014, and September 28, 2019, Applicant completed \nand signed Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations processing (e-QIP) or security \nclearance applications (SCA) SCAs. (Government Exhibit (GE) 1-GE 3). On October 15, \n2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DCSA CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in \nAppendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective \nJune 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline E. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn March 5, 2021, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. (HE \n3) On May 11, 2022, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On June 16, 2022, the \ncase was assigned to me. On July 19, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for August 30, 2022. (HE 1) The \nhearing was held as scheduled.    \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits into evidence, and \nApplicant offered six exhibits. (Transcript (Tr.) 14-18; GE 1-4; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-\nAE F) There were no objections, except Department Counsel objected to AE F because \nof lack of relevance. (Tr. 16-17). The objection goes to the weight and not the admissibility \nof AE F. All proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 15, 18; GE 1-GE 4; AE \nA-AE F) On September 12, 2022, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing. Applicant \nprovided one post-hearing exhibit, which was admitted without objection. (AE G (44 \npages)) On September 30, 2022, the record closed. (Tr. 108, 118)  \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he denied the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and \n1.c. (HE 3) \nApplicant is a 60-year-old level-four project manager employed by a DOD \ncontractor for five and a half years.

(Tr. 19) He has a project management professional certification \nand another specialty professional certification. (Tr. 19-20) \nPersonal Conduct  \nIn the 1980s while in college, Applicant used marijuana, but not cocaine. (Tr. 60, \n62) Around late 1995 to early 1996, he was using cocaine about every two weeks on \npaydays. (Tr. 63) He may have been addicted to cocaine in 1996. (Tr. 64)   \nIn 1996, Applicant purchased some crack cocaine. (Tr. 32) When he was on his \nway back to his vehicle, the police arrested him. (Tr. 32) He dropped the cocaine onto the \nground, and when the police searched him, they did not find any cocaine. (Tr. 32) The \npolice accused him of delivering cocaine to the cocaine dealers. (Tr. 32) He was charged \nwith felony-level possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. (Tr. 65; GE 1) The charge \nwas reduced to misdemeanor-level cocaine possession. (GE 1) Applicant was prosecuted \nin state court and not in federal court. He was not prosecuted under the Controlled \nSubstance Act, which is a federal statute. Applicant received probation before judgment. \n(Tr. 33; GE 1) He did not remember the length of the probation; however, he believed it \nwas for less than one year. (Tr. 66-67) He successfully completed the probation period, \nand the cocaine possession charge was dismissed. (Tr. 33) On May 22, 2000, a state \ncourt ordered expungement of Applicant\u2019s arrest for cocaine possession and cocaine \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npossession with intent to distribute from local, state, and federal law enforcement and \ncourt records. (Tr. 33-34, 108; AE G at 7-11) A federal court did not order expungement \nof his state court charge. \nThis is Applicant\u2019s sole criminal arrest or charge. (Tr. 51, 65) He did not use illegal \ndrugs after August 1996, and he never sold illegal drugs. (Tr. 33, 62, 71-73) He has never \nhad problems at work or in school due to fraudulent or dishonest behavior. (Tr. 52) He \nhas never been accused of a security violation. (Tr. 55) All of his character witnesses are \naware of his cocaine offense. (Tr. 55-56) He apologized for the errors on his SCAs. (Tr. \n58, 109) He described himself as an honest and trustworthy person. (Tr. 58, 110) \nApplicant\u2019s attorney verbally advised him when he was in court on the cocaine \ncharge that after the expungement, if he was asked on a job application about being \ncharged, he \u201ccould truthfully answer no, that it never happened.\u201d (Tr. 34-35) His attorney \nnever advised Applicant on the information to provide to complete his SCA. (Tr. 35) \nApplicant believed that after the expungement he could deny that he was charged on his \nSCA. (Tr. 35-36) He claimed he was not embarrassed by his conduct in 2004, and he is \nnot embarrassed by it now. (Tr. 36-37) He has moved on from the offense. (Tr. 36) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant deliberately omitted material facts on his March 25, \n2004 SCA when he answered \u201cNo\u201d in response to questions 21 and 24, which state as \nfollows: \n21. Your Police Record \u2013 Felony Offenses \nHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense? \n(include those under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.) (GE 3) \n24. Your Police Record \u2013 Alcohol/Drug Offenses \nHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to \nalcohol or drugs? (Id.) \nQuestions 21 and 24 included the following exception to disclosure: \nFor this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your \ncase has been \u201csealed\u201d or otherwise stricken from the record. The single \nexception to this requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal \nControlled Substances Act for the court issued an expungement order \nunder the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607. (Id.) \nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to these questions on his 2004 SCA. (Tr. 78-79; GE 3) \nHe said he did not remember his state of mind when he completed these two questions \non his 2004 SCA. (Tr. 39) He remembered that there was a time constraint for completion \nof the 2004 SCA. (Tr. 76) He acknowledged it was his responsibility to ensure the 2004 \nSCA included accurate information. (Tr. 76) He believed he would have answered \u201cNo\u201d \nbecause of the advice he received from his attorney about not needing to disclose the \ncharge due to its expungement. (Tr. 39-40) He believed his answer was truthful because \nof the advice from his attorney. (Tr. 79) He did not believe his cocaine charge would have \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naffected his security clearance. (Tr. 40, 79-81) He did not receive a copy of his 2004 SCA, \nand he did not review it after completing it. (Tr. 77. 101) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant falsified material facts in Section 22 of his July 30, \n2014 SCA. Section 22-Police Records states: \nFor this section report information regardless of whether record in your case \nhas been sealed, expunged, or otherwise stricken from the court record, or \nthe charge was dismissed. You need not report convictions under the \nFederal Controlled Substances Act for which the court ordered an \nexpungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.  \nPolice Record (EVER) Other than those offenses already listed, have you \nEVER had the following happen to you? Have you EVER been convicted in \nany court of the United States of a crime, sentenced to imprisonment for a \nterm exceeding 1 year for that crime, and incarcerated as a result of that \nsentence for not less than 1 year? Have you EVER been charged with any \nfelony offense? Have you EVER been charged with an offense involving \nalcohol or drugs? (GE 2)  \nAppellant answered \u201cNo\u201d to these last two questions, and he did not disclose his \n1996 felony charge of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. (GE 2) He said he \nprobably did not thoroughly read the instruction about disclosing expunged information \nwhen he completed his 2014 SCA. (Tr. 41-42) He was probably thinking about his \nattorney\u2019s advice that he need not disclose the drug offense in 1996. (Tr. 41) He relied on \nhis attorney\u2019s advice that he could answer \u201cNo\u201d because the charge was expunged. (Tr. \n84) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant falsified material facts in Section 23 of his July 30, \n2014 SCA, which states \u201cSection 23 - Illegal use of Drugs or Drug Activity \u2013 Voluntary \nTreatment Have you EVER voluntarily sought counseling or treatment as a result of your \nuse of a drug or controlled substance?\u201d (GE 2) Applicant answered \u201cNo.\u201d (GE 2) He did \nnot disclose his drug treatment from February 1997 to about May 1997. \nIn 1997, Applicant attended a 12 to 16 week intensive outpatient treatment \nprogram, which entailed attendance three days a week for 90 to 120 minutes of daily \ngroup counseling. (Tr. 42, 68, 70) The treatment was voluntary and not court ordered. (Tr. \n42) He successfully completed the treatment program. (Tr. 44) He also attended \nNarcotics Anonymous meetings. (Tr. 69) He answered \u201cNo\u201d on his 2014 SCA probably \nbecause he was rushing and did not thoroughly read the question. (Tr. 43) His facility \nsecurity officer told him to hurry up and complete the form. (Tr. 44-46, 87-88) He \nestimated that he took about two days to complete his 2014 SCA; however, he only \nworked on it at work and there were other work requirements. (Tr. 88, 102) He simply \nmissed the question and the erroneous answer was an unintentional mistake. (Tr. 44) His \nattorney did not tell him that he could deny that he received drug treatment. (Tr. 84-85) \nHe agreed that he should have answered \u201cYes\u201d to this question.

(Tr. 48; GE 1) He also disclosed his drug treatment in the 1996 to 1997 \ntimeframe. (Tr. 49) He said he disclosed the charge and drug treatment because he read \nan article about clearances, which indicated expunged charges such as his 1996 cocaine \noffense needed to be disclosed, and he had more time to complete the SCA. (Tr. 48-51; \nAE F) The article he read was similar to the article Applicant provided at his hearing. (AE \nF) The article indicates it is a common error to believe a non-federal expungement applies \nto limit the disclosure requirement in SCAs. \nApplicant did not remember the follow-up Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \npersonal subject interviews (PSI) after he completed his 2004 and 2014 SCAs, and those \nPSIs were not exhibits in this case. (Tr. 57) In 2017, he told the OPM investigator that he \ndid not list his cocaine charges on his previous SCAs because his attorney told him \nexpungement was \u201clike the incidents did not happen and there was no need to list it on \nhis case papers.\u201d (Tr. 98) His 2017 OPM PSI states that in 2014, he researched the issue \nof expunged information and learned it was better to disclose the information especially \nsince the investigation might find the expunged information. (Tr. 98-99) His emails to \nanother government agency corroborate his statement about the timing of his research \nabout expungement occurring after he completed his 2014 SCA. (AE G at 1-6) He denied \nthat he told the OPM investigator that the reason he disclosed the charge of cocaine \npossession with intent to distribute was because he was worried about investigators \nfinding the expunged information. (Tr. 104-105) Applicant\u2019s statement to the OPM \ninvestigator in 2017 was consistent with his hearing statement. \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant provided his resume, nine character letter references, awards, and his\nperformance appraisals from 2018 to 2020. (AE A; AE C-AE E) His employer, customers, \ncoworkers, \nand \nfriends \npraised \nhis \nperformance, \ndiligence, \ntrustworthiness, \nprofessionalism, and contributions to mission accomplishment. (Tr. 21-31; AE A; AE C-\nAE E) He frequently received bonuses and pay raises. (Tr. 23) He volunteered in his \nchurch and community. (Tr. 52-54) The general sense of the character evidence is that \nApplicant is an outstanding employee and citizen.  \n \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility:   \n. . .  (b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions \nof investigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 lists one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. AG \u00b6 16(a) states: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \nAG \u00b6 16(a) is established. This disqualifying condition will be discussed in the \nmitigation section, infra. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd.

Applicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree, and his \ncharacter evidence establishes that is exceptionally intelligent. He understood the \ninformation the government sought. He was required to disclose any felony charges on \nhis 2004 and 2014 SCAs, and his drug treatment on his 2014 SCA.

[Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E \nand the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present \nevidence to explain the omission.  \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). \nI accept Applicant\u2019s statement as true that his lawyer advised him that he did not \nneed to disclose his expunged arrest and charge of cocaine possession. Expungements \nof criminal records enable defendants to avoid the negative effects to their employment, \ndamage their reputations, and for other reasons entailed with serious criminal arrests and \ncharges. Applicant\u2019s counsel told him that the expungement meant it was as though the \noffense never happened, and he did not have to disclose the information about being \narrested. Applicant admitted that his counsel\u2019s advice was not \u201cspecifically concerning \nsecurity processes.\u201d See AG 17(b) (emphasis added). AG 17(b) does not apply. \nApplicant misinterpreted his attorney\u2019s advice about expungements to be \napplicable to SCAs. He said his decision not to disclose the cocaine possession charge \non his 2004 and 2014 SCAs was made in reliance on his counsel\u2019s advice. He did not \nprovide a plausible reason for not disclosing the derogatory information other than his \nstatement that it was expunged. A person of his intelligence would have recognized that \nthe SCA\u2019s exclusion for expunged convictions was limited to federal drug charges or at \nleast that he needed to checked with an attorney before assuming it enabled him not to \ndisclose a felony-level drug charge. \nAs for the question on his 2014 SCA about his history of drug treatment, Applicant \nsaid he answered \u201cNo\u201d probably because he was rushing and did not thoroughly read the \nquestion. His facility security officer told him to hurry up and complete the form. He \nclaimed he simply missed the question, and the erroneous answer was an unintentional \nmistake. This statement about missing the question is not credible. His statement about \nmissing the question will not be used for disqualification purposes; however, it is important \nis assessing his credibility and rehabilitation. \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s statements about his intent and state of mind when he executed his \nSecurity Clearance Application were relevant evidence, but they were not binding on the \nAdministrative Judge.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-09488 at 2 (App. Bd.

Feb. 14, 2019) the Appeal Board \nrecognized the importance of circumstantial evidence of intent in falsification cases: \nWhen evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge \nshould consider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the record \nevidence. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd. May 30, 2017). \nAs a practical matter, a finding regarding an applicant\u2019s intent or state of \nmind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s statements, but rather may \nrely on circumstantial evidence. Id. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply to Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his \ndrug treatment on his 2014 SCA. His claim at his hearing that he did not carefully read \nthe question sufficiently to understand what he was required to disclose was not truthful. \nHe should have been sensitive to the issue of his cocaine involvement because of his \narrest, prosecution, probation, drug treatment, and effort to have the incident expunged. \nA reasonable inference is that he realized that disclosure of his drug treatment may have \nled to follow-up questions during his OPM PSI about his involvement with illegal drugs. \nApplicant failed to admit that when he completed his 2014 SCA, he read the \nquestion about voluntary drug treatment; he understood it; and he knowingly elected not \nto disclose his drug treatment on his 2014 SCA. His failure to candidly describe his mental \nstate is an indication that he has not been successfully rehabilitated. \u201c[W]hen an applicant \nis unwilling or unable to accept responsibility for his own actions, such a failure is evidence \nthat detracts from a finding of reform and rehabilitation.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 21-00321 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 8, 2022) (citing ISCR Case 96-0360 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 25, 1997) (the \npassage of 14 years after offense without additional offenses did not establish \nrehabilitation because of absence of frank and candid description of offense in 2007). \nApplicant failed to admit that he read the question in his 2014 SCA about drug \ntreatment and understood it, and he relied upon his attorney\u2019s advice in the face of the \nclear language in the SCAs limiting the scope of the exception to disclosure. His failures \nto disclose information about his felony-level drug-related charge and drug treatment on \nhis 2004 and 2014 SCAs continue to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. He failed to meet his burden of establishing mitigation of personal \nconduct security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline E are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 60-year-old level-four project manager employed by a DOD \ncontractor for five and a half years. In 1988, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical \nengineering. He has a project management professional certification and another \nspecialty professional certification. \nApplicant\u2019s resume, nine character letter references, awards, and his performance \nappraisals from 2018 to 2020 establish his excellent performance, diligence, \ntrustworthiness, professionalism, and contributions to mission accomplishment. He \nfrequently received bonuses and pay raises. He volunteered in his church and \ncommunity. He is an outstanding employee and citizen. \nThe evidence against mitigation of Applicant\u2019s decisions not to disclose information \nabout being charged in 1996 with felony-level cocaine possession with intent to distribute \non his 2004 and 2014 SCAs and with drug treatment in 1997 on his 2014 SCA is more \npersuasive. He said his failure to disclose his 1996 charge of felony-level cocaine \npossession with intent to distribute on his 2004 and 2014 SCAs was based on his lawyer\u2019s \nadvice about expungement; however, he admitted his lawyer did not advise him on \ncompletion of SCAs.

(Item 2 at 1) During part of this period, he \nheld a security clearance for his duties in the military. (Item 2 at 1) \nIn July 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized DOD investigator. During \nthe interview, he told the investigator that he had not used marijuana since he was in high \nschool in 2014. (Item 5) In February 2020, Applicant completed interrogatories.

Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law.

According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement \nUnder this concern, \u201cthe illegal use of controlled substances to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended \npurpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both \nbecause such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it \nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \nApplicant used marijuana for approximately three years. During part of this time, he \nheld a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana subsequently led to him failing a \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ndrug test in 2017, and ultimately, to his administrative discharge from the military. Under \nthese circumstances, the following disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance abuse, \nAG \u00b6 25(b) testing positive for an illegal drug, and \nAG \u00b6 25(f), any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information \nor holding a sensitive position. \nApplicant now admits his past marijuana use. However, his promise not to use \nmarijuana in the future has minimal probative value given his falsification about earlier \nmarijuana usage, as discussed in the section below. Consequently, I conclude that none of \nthe mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has failed to mitigate the drug involvement \nsecurity concern. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nUnder this concern, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Applicant admitted falsifying information regarding his marijuana \nuse during a subject interview in 2017 and in response to interrogatories completed in \n2020.  These falsifications trigger the application of the following disqualifying conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved in \nmaking a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative.  \nApplicant offered no mitigating explanation for his false responses. Consequently, \nnone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant failed to mitigate the personal conduct \nsecurity concerns. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the whole-person concept factors when I evaluated the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and E, and they do not warrant a favorable \nconclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information.

Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

The \nguideline encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting classified information. A person who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012). \nApplicant incurred debts when she was laid off and underemployed in 2015. She \nwas supporting her youngest son at the time.

Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nApplicant\u2019s failure to address her remaining delinquent accounts puts into question \nher reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Although she has been employed in \nher current position since 2018, she has done very little to address her debts. Except for \nthe two resolved accounts, mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) - 20(e) do not apply to the \nremaining debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s life circumstances, in particular her divorces and job loss. However, I remain \nunconvinced of her overall financial responsibility, efforts to resolve delinquent debts, and \nher ability, intent, and desire to meet her financial obligations in the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with question and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I considered \nthe exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Appendix C, dated \nJune 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n  Subparagraphs 1.a, 1b, 1d, and 1.f-1.j:  \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Despite the fact that he was functioning well at the time of the evaluation, the \nmental health professional reported that there is a moderate to high probability that \nApplicant will experience another manic/hypomanic or depressive episode in the future. \nHis prognosis is guarded given the evidence of his three most recent hospitalizations \nand due to the chronic nature of Bipolar I Disorder; the high probability of reoccurrence \nof manic/hypomanic and depressive episodes; and his problematic use of alcohol. She \nalso noted the interactive effects of alcohol used with his listed psychotropic \nmedications was worrisome. Applicant admitted to drinking more than intended at least \none time per month. His current use of alcohol could have a negative effect in the \nmanagement of his Bipolar I Disorder. (GE 3) \nThe clinical psychologist endorsed Applicant\u2019s continuation of current psychiatric \ntreatment and mental health counseling. She recommended that he reduce and \npreferably abstain from all alcohol use, especially since he is taking psychotropic \nmedications. His current Bipolar I Disorder and Alcohol Use Disorder appear to make \nhim vulnerable to blackmail, pressure or coercion, and therefore concluded that \nApplicant is an unsuitable candidate for a security clearance. (GE 3) \nApplicant admitted that during some of his counseling sessions discussions \nconcerning his alcohol use had been initiated. During his manic episodes he drank \nalcohol more frequently, and at times daily. He abstained from drinking alcohol after his \n2016 hospital discharge, as his treating doctor at that time, advised him to stop. He \nreturned to drinking alcohol in early 2018, when he was in the beginning stages of a \nmanic episode. After his discharge from the hospital in 2018, he was again advised to \nabstain from using alcohol. Applicant testified that he did not abstain but chose instead \nto moderate his use of alcohol. He currently drinks alcohol on a regular basis, usually 6 \nto 8 drinks during the week. He testified that his current use of alcohol does not cause a \nproblem in his ability to protect classified information. He also acknowledged, after \nreceiving the SOR in September 2020, his awareness of the Government\u2019s concern \nabout his current use of alcohol against medical advice. Even though he has been \nadvised by multiple medical professionals to abstain from using alcohol, it is his \nintention to continue to limit his use of alcohol in the future. (GE 6; Tr. 27, 32-33, 37-49) \nApplicant provided employee performance evaluations covering 2017, 2018, and \n2019. All of his assessments described him as a valued employee and critical \ncontributor. He is viewed as one of the leaders in the industry for innovative ideas and \nmathematical approaches to complex physics. Applicant\u2019s endeavors support the needs \nof the customer and organization. (AE I) \nThe technical director at his employment and a former co-worker appeared as \nwitnesses for Applicant. They both knew him when he was first hired by his current \nemployer in 2002. Both witnesses testified that Applicant is brilliant and an exceptional \nasset to the company. They testified that they were aware of his mental health issues, \nbut overall, they believe he is reliable and trustworthy, and recommended that his \nsecurity clearance be reinstated.

(Tr. 67-91) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nAG \u00b6 27 expresses the security concern for psychological conditions: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling.  \nThe medical diagnoses and records in evidence raised the following \nPsychological Conditions Disqualifying Conditions under AG \u00b6 28: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors;  \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient treatment; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions.  \nThe SOR alleges psychological conditions security concerns based on \nApplicant\u2019s history of psychiatric hospitalizations and his current use of alcohol against \nmedical advice. Additional psychological concerns were developed from the November \n15, 2019 psychological evaluation, by a clinical psychologist who diagnosed Applicant \nwith Bipolar I Disorder and Alcohol Use Disorder, mild.

She found it troubling that he continued using alcohol while taking \npsychotropic medications. Applicant has a history of excessive alcohol use during manic \nepisodes, and she expressed concern about his current alcohol use and the ability to \neffectively treat his bipolar disorder. Based on her overall assessment, she found that \nApplicant had a condition which could impair his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. \nI considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer has indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: [adjust margins] \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd.

In 2016, 2017, and 2018, he was admitted into hospitals, both voluntary and \ninvoluntary, for psychiatric issues. Applicant was advised by medical professionals to \nabstain from alcohol. He stopped consuming alcohol in 2016, but he resumed using \nalcohol in 2018 during the beginning stages of a manic episode. According to the \nmedical records, he was drinking 4 to 5 drinks daily. \nApplicant acknowledged multiple warnings given by medical and mental health \nprofessionals that alcohol use is not compatible with treating his bipolar disorder, which \nhas a high probability of recurrence or exacerbation. Despite this information, he has \nchosen to drink alcohol on a regular basis, usually 6 to 8 drinks during the week. I took \ninto consideration that Applicant is a valued employee by his employer, and he is \ncompliant taking his medications and attending therapy sessions. Overall, I find that he \nhas failed to follow critical medical advice and he is not fully compliant with his treatment \nplan. His continued use of alcohol while receiving treatment and medication for his \nmental health condition may impair his judgment, stability, and reliability. The \npsychological conditions security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the alcohol consumption security concern as follows: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 lists one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case including: \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder. \nBeginning in 2016, Applicant has been advised by medical and mental health \nprofessionals to abstain from using alcohol. In November 2019, he was diagnosed with \nAlcohol Use Disorder, mild. He continues to consume 6 to 8 drinks weekly. AG \u00b6 22(d) \nis established. \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nApplicant has a history of alcohol consumption and he drinks more frequently \nduring manic episodes. Beginning in 2016, Applicant has been advised by medical and \nmental health professionals to abstain from using alcohol while undergoing treatment for \na bipolar disorder. In November 2019 he was diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder, \nmild. While Applicant claims that he now drinks in moderation while his mental health \ntreatment is on-going, he did not provide sufficient evidence to show that his past \nexcessive use of alcohol occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur, or that \nit no longer casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. Alcohol \nconsumption security concerns are not mitigated. \n  Whole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is doing well in his current treatment and he is compliant in the use of \nprescribed psychotropic medications for his Bipolar I Disorder.

He is also a highly-valued employee capable of complex work that is \nbeneficial to DOD\u2019s mission. \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive at this time. Applicant is \ncurrently noncompliant with a consistent component of his treatment plan - to abstain \nfrom using alcohol. He is taking prescribed medicines that are not compatible with \nalcohol use, and he drinks despite noted medical concerns that using alcohol may \nagitate his stabilized mood. I am not convinced that past psychological issues or \nexcessive use of alcohol are unlikely to recur. As such, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts about his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the \nfuture. With more time without any conduct of security concern, and a longer track \nrecord of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. I have carefully applied the \nlaw, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal \nBoard\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. \nApplicant failed to mitigate the psychological conditions and alcohol consumption \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a, and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25 and 26 \n(setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person's \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any \nof the behaviors listed above. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions or factors: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance . . . ; \nAG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation; \nAG \u00b6 25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement . . . or failure to \nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse; \n AG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or         \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n3 \n\n \n \n \nApplicant admitted using marijuana on three occasions, in June 2003 and June \n2008, the latter while holding a security clearance, and with his last and most recent usage \nbeing in September 2018. Applicant also admitted that it is likely or possible he would use \nmarijuana in the future if the occasion arises.  Facts admitted by an applicant in an answer \nto an SOR or in an interview require no further proof from the Government. ISCR Case \nNo. 94-1159 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1995) (\u201cany admissions [applicant] made to the SOR \nallegations . . . relieve Department Counsel of its burden of proof\u201d); ISCR Case No. 94-\n0569 at 4 and n.1 (App. Bd.

In an October 25, 2014 \nmemorandum, the Director of National Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is \na security concern. James R. Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, Memorandum: \nAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use (October 25, 2014). See also \nhttp://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml \nMore recently, on December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed \nthe memorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana \nfor Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that federal \nlaw remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production and \ndistribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position \nare prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana use) remains relevant, but \nnot determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant\u2019s behavior \nraises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nDisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), and (f), apply here. Because of Applicant\u2019s \npast use of marijuana and his equivocation on future use, AG \u00b6 25(g) may also apply. \nThe next inquiry is whether any mitigating factors apply. \nI have considered mitigating factor AG \u00b6 26(a). Applicant used illegal drugs on three \noccasions, in June 2003, June 2008 (with a clearance), and in September 2018. His \nbehavior was infrequent; his first use was in 2003, his next use in 2008, and his last use \nin 2018, almost four years ago. I find that AG \u00b6 26(a) applies, thereby mitigating AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a), (c), and (f). \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), and (f) are principally retrospective-looking, that is, they look to past \nconduct to inform a predictive assessment of potential future conduct. Provision AG \u00b6 \n25(g), however, looks at contemporaneous expressions of future intent to use illegal \ndrugs. Here, in his PSI Applicant stated that \u201cit is likely\u2026 [and] possible [he] will smoke \nmarijuana again if the opportunity arises.\u201d That statement requires a consideration under \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25(g) whether Applicant has \u201cclearly and convincingly [committed] to discontinue \nsuch misuse.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b) has mitigating elements that complement the \u201cclearly and \nconvincingly\u201d element of AG \u00b6 25(g). Those complements are: (1) acknowledgement of \ndrug involvement; (2) a pattern of abstinence; (3) disassociation from drug-using \nassociates; (3) avoiding a drug-using environment; and (4) a signed statement to abstain \nfrom all future misuse of drugs, which misuse will be grounds for revocation of security \neligibility. \nIn his SCA, his Answer to the SOR, his PSI, and his responses to interrogatories, \nApplicant has acknowledged his drug involvement. Applicant abstained from drug usage \nfrom 2003 until 2008 (five years) and from 2008 until 2018 (ten years). In his PSI, \nApplicant stated that he does not socialize with individuals who use illegal drugs. He also \nstated that if he found himself in a drug-using environment, he would \u201cleave the area.\u201d \nFinally, Applicant submitted two statements disavowing any intent to use illegal drugs in \nthe future. It is fair to infer from his many years working for defense contractors that he \nwas, and is, aware that future illegal drug usage would jeopardize his security clearance \neligibility. I find that AG \u00b6 26(b) mitigates disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 25(g). \nThe record does not raise doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \njudgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6). Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant has met \nhis ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the SOR allegations: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c:  \n   For Applicant  \n    For Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant Applicant access to classified information. \nPhilip J.

(Tr. p. 100.) Accordingly, the motion was granted and the \namendments were made. (Tr. p. 101.) \nProcedural Rulings \nThe Government requested I take administrative notice of certain facts relating to \nthe country of Turkey. Department Counsel provided a five page summary of the facts, \nsupported by five Government documents pertaining to Turkey, identified as HE 1. The \ndocuments provide elaboration and context for the summary. \nApplicant had no \nobjection. (Tr. p. 16.) I took administrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. \nGovernment reports. They are limited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to \nreasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted each of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of \nfact. \nApplicant is 40 years old and married. She has a Master\u2019s degree in Mechanical \nEngineering. \nShe currently holds the position of Manufacturing Engineer. \nShe is \napplying for a security clearance in connection with her employment with a defense \ncontractor.  Applicant began working for her current employer in July 2018. \nApplicant was born in Turkey and grew up there. She entered the United States \nin 1997, with her family, on a green card, and became a permanent legal resident. \nApplicant attended one semester at a university in the United States and changed her \nmajor. She then applied to and attended another university more fitting for her new \nmajor. Applicant completed her Master\u2019s degree program in 2004. That same year, \nshe became a naturalized U.S. citizen. \nAfter graduating from college, Applicant \nreturned to Turkey. She explained that it was customary for her to return to Turkey for \nseveral months during the summer breaks while in college to visit her family and friends \nthere. It is noted that Applicant was financially supported by her father in Turkey \nthroughout her college education. Applicant stated that she did not get along with her \nmother, and wanted to stay away from her.

She was laid off from her last job in the United States after \ntwo and a half years of employment. Due to parental pressures, concern about her \nfather\u2019s health, and lack of employment, she chose to relocate back to Turkey in August \n2009. (Tr. pp. 40-45, and Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) \nOnce in Turkey, Applicant established her roots there. In 2011, she married a \nTurkish man, who was a dentist. Applicant states that when she married him she \nwanted to relocate to the United States, but she never discussed the issue with him \nbefore they married. He had no interest in coming to the United States. They divorced \nin March 2017. (Tr. pp. 67-60.) \nFrom November 2009 to July 2018, Applicant worked for the Turkish Aerospace \nIndustries (TAI), manufacturing and providing various forms of military aircraft, drones, \nunmanned surveillance and other aerospace equipment exclusively for the Turkish \nGovernment. Over the nine years she worked there, she advanced from a tool design \nengineer to a manufacturing engineer, and program leader, a position she enjoyed. \nWhile in Turkey, working for TAI, Applicant developed many engineering contacts and \nmet employees who worked for her current employer in the U.S. Some of them had \nlong-term contracts working for Applicant\u2019s current employer and were assigned to \nTurkey. Applicant established communications with these individuals while they were \nworking in Turkey. \nOver time they became good friends and Applicant ultimately \nlearned about her current job position in the U.S. from one of these individuals. (Tr. p. \n53.) \nIn 2018, Applicant, from Turkey, applied for the position with her current \nemployer. She was interviewed over the telephone and hired. (Tr. p. 91.) Applicant \nmoved to the United States in July 2018, and began working for her current employer. \nIn 2019, she met her current husband, a Turkish national. They were married in \nNovember 2020. (Tr. p. 62.) He has an extension on his green card, and recently filed \nan application for a new green card based on his marriage to the Applicant. He is \ncurrently unemployed.  (Tr. p. 64.) \nApplicant maintains contact with friends and former colleagues who are currently \nemployed by the TAI in various roles working on projects with and for the Turkish \nmilitary.  (Tr. p. 102.) \nApplicant\u2019s has a number of family members who are citizens and residents of \nTurkey. These family members include Applicant\u2019s father, mother, husband, mother-in-\nlaw, and a cousin. Applicant\u2019s two brothers are dual-citizens of Turkey and the United \nStates. Her older brother resides in the United States. He has a Ph.D in Mechanical \nEngineering, is a professor at a University here, and owns his own company. As a \nprofessor, he is involved in a rotational teaching program allowing him to travel to \nvarious universities within the United States to teach or conduct research. He has not \ntraveled to Turkey for about eight or nine years. Applicant testified that she maintains \nregular contact with her older brother who resides in the United States. She speaks \nwith him about twice a week. They discuss matters pertaining their parents health and \nwell-being. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s younger brother was born in the United States, but returned to Turkey \nas an infant. In 2014, he moved from Turkey to the U.S, to attend college. He has \nrecently moved to Texas, and working for a company there. Applicant has not had any \ncontact with him for several years.  \nThe evidence about her foreign connections was conflicting and mixed. \nApplicant stated that, \u201cI hated living in Turkey, especially as a woman, so I was looking \nfor ways out.\u201d (Tr. p. 50.) However, despite becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, \nApplicant exercises Turkish residency. Applicant maintains a bank account in Turkey \nthat has about $200 U.S. dollars in it. She keeps this account open to help her mother if \nshe needs money. She also does not want to ask her parents for money when she \nvisits Turkey. Applicant voted in two elections in Turkey, including the most recent \nPresidential election that occurred in July 2018 because she did not like the President in \nTurkey. Applicant is also eligible to receive a pension from Turkey when she meets the \nage requirement. She believes it will amount to about $300 a month when she is 50 \nyears old. Applicant also has a valid Turkish passport and uses it in lieu of her U.S. \npassport to reenter Turkey for convenience purposes when she travels there. (Tr. p. \n69.) \nIn assessing the heightened risk created as a result of Applicant holding a \nsecurity clearance, the Applicant\u2019s ties to a hostile country are important. However, \neven countries friendly to the United States have attempted to gain unauthorized access \nto classified information. Under the particular facts of this case, I have taken \nadministrative notice of the information provided concerning the Country of Turkey. \nTurkey is a constitutional republic with an executive presidential system and a \nunicameral 600 seat parliament (the Grand National Assembly). \nThe U.S.-Turkey \nrelationship dates back to 1831, when the Unites States established diplomatic relations \nwith the Ottomar Empire. Over the years, the U.S. has been committed to emphasizing \nthe importance of the Turkish government\u2019s adherence to policies and actions that build \npublic trust in the country\u2019s democractic institutions and the rule of law, as well as \nupholding human rights commitments. \nIn recent years, democracy in Turkey has \ncontinued to deteriorate. President Erdogan has ruled Turkey since 2003, and during \nthat time has expanded his control over Turkey and its institutions. U.S. and European \nUnion officials have expressed a number of concerns about authoritarian governance \nand erosion of rule of law and civil liberties in Turkey. Turkey is a member of the UN, \nNATO, and the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. However, due to Turkey\u2019s regional \nambitions and a distrust of the United States, the growing authoritarianism of Turkey\u2019s \nleaders are complicating the bilateral relationship and make Turkey more willing to \nchallenge U.S. regional goals. Besides Covid restrictions, travelers are to exercise \nincreased caution due to terrorism and arbitrary detentions. There are high-threat \nlocations for terrorism in Turkey directed at affecting official U.S. Government interests, \nwestern tourists and expatriates. Turkey is a source of transit for foreign terrorist \nfighters seeking to join ISIS and other terrorist groups fighting in Syria and Iraq. ISIS \nand ISIS offshoot organizations have a significant presence in northern Syria, and along \nportions of the Turkish/Syrian border. The Kurdistan People\u2019s Congress (also Kongra \nGel, KGK; and Kurdistand Worker\u2019s Party, PKK) has been the most active terrorist \norganization in Turkey, targeting Turkish government facilities and infrastructure. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHuman Rights and fundamental freedoms violations and a compromised rule of law has \nresulted in many arbitrary killings, torture, detention of tens of thousands of persons \nincluding former opposition members of parliament, lawyers, journalists, foreign citizens, \nelected officials, and employees of the U.S. Mission. There are severe restrictions on \nfreedom of expression, threats and violence toward judicial independence, the press, \nunjustified arrests or criminal prosecutions for criticizing government policies or officials. \n(HE-1.)   \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nApplicant\u2019s foreign contacts include her mother, father, two brothers, her \nhusband, mother-on-law, and a cousin. \nShe also has a number of professional \ncolleagues and friends she has worked with whom she remains close to and are also \ncitizens and residents of Turkey, or are dual citizens of both countries, like she is. \nBased upon the evidence presented, these close foreign contacts and unique \nrelationships may pose a threat and negatively influence Applicant\u2019s decision making, \nimpacting the interests and security of the United States.

Her family members in Turkey pose no undue security risk. \nHowever, most concerning is Applicant\u2019s contacts with the Turkish Aerospace \nemployees. There was no evidence presented that showed similar relationships she \nhas established in the United States. Under the particular circumstances here, the risk-\nbenefit analysis is applicable, and these contacts do pose a significant security risk to \nthe U.S. government. They may manipulate, induce, or influence the Applicant to help a \nforeign person or government in a way that is inconsistent with the U.S. interests. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nAs discussed above, most concerning is Applicant\u2019s contacts with her foreign \naerospace associates and long-time friends in Turkey. The nature of the contacts, the \npositions, skills, and activities of these individuals, and the protected information \nApplicant may access could create a risk for foreign influence. These contacts can \nresult in a situation that may create a divided allegiance. Applicant has shown no deep \nand longstanding relationship with or loyalties to the United States. Full mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c), has not been established. \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he may provide information or \nmake decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  \nForeign involvement raises concerns about an individual\u2019s judgement, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. national \ninterests or when the individual acts to conceal it.  By itself: the fact that a \nU.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not disqualifying without \nan objective showing of such conflict or attempt at concealment.  The \nsame is true for a U.S. citizen\u2019s exercise of any right or privilege of foreign \ncitizenship and any action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign \ncitizenship. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) failure to use a U.S. passport when entering or exiting the U.S. \nApplicant maintains her Turkish passport for convenience purposes and uses it \nwhen she travels to Turkey. Although she is a naturalized U.S. citizen she continues to \nuse privileges afforded exclusively to Turkish citizens. \nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 11 including: \n(a) the foreign citizenship is not in conflict with U.S. national security interests;\nand \n \n(b) dual citizenship is based solely on parental citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country, and there is no evidence of foreign preference. \nApplicant\u2019s actions exhibit a strong foreign preference for the country of Turkey. \nShe maintains a Turkish bank account, votes in their elections, is eligible for a pension \nin Turkey when she meets the age requirement, and maintains and uses her Turkish \npassport when she travels there, instead of using her U.S. passport. This is not an \nindividual who shows loyalty to the U.S. or has made a commitment to break her ties \nfrom her permanent home of Turkey. In fact, she is quite immersed with what is going \non in Turkey. Applicant has only been in the United States for a few years now, since \n2018. She has no real assets here in the United States. She does not own a home, \nand there is no evidence of any other assets. The above mitigating condition is not \napplicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and C in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Under the \nparticular facts of this case, Applicant\u2019s Turkish connections pose a significant risk to \nthe U.S. government, and she shows a strong foreign preference for Turkey. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the Foreign Influence and Foreign Preference \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c. \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d. through 1.g \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: through 2.b. \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

The SOR alleges that Applicant has five delinquent student loan debts totaling approximately $29,000. In his Answer, Applicant denies each of the allegations and provides explanations. Credit reports of the Applicant dated April 19, 2019; February 14, 2022; and May 13, 2022, reflect that each of these debts were at one time owing. (Government Exhibits 3, 4 and 5.) Applicant applied for and received student loans to attend a university to obtain his Bachelor\u2019s degree and Master\u2019s degree. He obtained his Bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007, and his Master\u2019s degree in 2013. He tried to work full time while going to school, took some courses on line, had various jobs, some of which were contracting jobs that did not provide stable employment.

Applicant set up an income driven payment plan but was unable \nto make the payments toward the debt until 2016/2017, when he was earning more \nmoney. \nIn March 2019, Applicant began working for his current employer. Applicant \ncompleted a security clearance application dated April 4, 2019. (Government Exhibit 1.) \nThis was his first time applying for a security clearance. \nAs part of his security \nclearance background investigation, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized \ninvestigator for the DoD on April 26, 2019. \n(Government Exhibit 2.) \nDuring the \ninterview, Applicant\u2019s delinquent student loans were brought to his attention. At that \npoint, Applicant realized the importance of addressing these debts. Applicant hired an \nAsset Recovery agency to assist him in resolving his delinquent student loan debt. \nIn April 2022, Applicant consolidated all of his student loan accounts he took out \nfor his Bachelor\u2019s degree and Master\u2019s degree, and set up a payment plan that he \nintended to follow. \nApplicant was scheduled to pay $600 monthly to begin in \nJanuary/February 2022.

Applicant no longer owed the creditor the $29,000 for the \ndebts set forth below. Applicant also learned that monies totaling $5,200, that he had \npaid from June 2021 to January 2022 toward resolving the debts would be refunded to \nhim. (Tr. p. 55.) \nEach of the delinquent debts set forth in the SOR are no longer owing and are no \nlonger of security concern: \nAllegation 1.a., is a delinquent debt for a student loan account that was charged \noff in the approximate amount of $7,714. The debt was forgiven, effective June 30, \n2021.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A1 through A12.) \nAllegation 1.b., is a delinquent debt for a student loan account that was charged \noff in the approximate amount of $7,547. The debt was forgiven, effective June 30, \n2021. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A1 through A12.) \nAllegation 1.c., is a delinquent debt for a student loan account that was charged \noff in the approximate amount of $6,212. The debt was forgiven, effective June 30, \n2021.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A1 through A12.) \nAllegation 1.d., is a delinquent debt for a student loan account that was charged \noff in the approximate amount of $5,451. The debt was forgiven, effective June 30, \n2021.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A1 through A12.) \nAllegation 1.e., is a delinquent debt for a student loan account that was charged \noff in the approximate amount of $2,268. The debt was forgiven, effective June 30, \n2021.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A 1 through A12.) \nApplicant testified that he still owes approximately $189,000 in student loans to \nseveral student loan entities. These loans remain owing, but are in good-standing \nbecause he is making regular monthly payments toward resolving the debts. (Tr. p. 47.) \nHe plans to follow the payment plan consistent with the requirements of the creditor until \nhe resolves the debt. \nApplicant stated that he currently brings home approximately $4,200 monthly. \nAfter paying his regular monthly expenses, including his student loan payments of $600 \nmonthly, he has about $1,000 left in discretionary funds. \n(Tr. p. 52.) \nHe lives \nresponsibly and does not spend money he does not have. \nHe currently has no \ndelinquent debts.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred student loan debt while attending college that he could not \nafford to pay. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nFour Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant no longer owes the delinquent debt alleged in the SOR. His student \nloans debt in the amount of $29,000 as alleged has been dismissed. \nApplicant\u2019s \nremaining student loan debt is being paid through regular monthly payments in \nsatisfaction with the creditor. \nIdeally, Applicant should have been able to make \npayments toward this debt earlier and well before his security clearance became an \nissue. However, under the circumstances, confronted with low paying jobs and periods \nof unemployment, Applicant has acted in a reasonable and responsible manner. He \nhas shown good judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. There are clear indications \nthat his financial indebtedness has been resolved and is under control. Applicant has \ndemonstrated a good-faith effort to resolve his debts, and has demonstrated that future \nfinancial problems are unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides full mitigation. \nThe Financial \nConsiderations concern has been mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant has \nshown maturity and responsibility. \nHe understands the responsibilities involved in \npossessing a security clearance. He has shown the requisite good judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness required of this privilege. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

One son lives with her, and one son lives in another state. (Tr. 40- 41) Since May 2016, Applicant has worked as a custodian for a defense contractor. Her job involves cleaning offices on a U.S. military facility. She needs a security clearance so she can access certain secure areas on the facility in order to do her job.

The case \nwas assigned to the Department Counsel\u2019s office of the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) for review on July 14, 2020. On July 20, 2020, Department Counsel \nexercised their right to request a hearing in the case, under Paragraph E3.1.7 of \nEnclosure 3 (Additional Procedural Guidance) of DOD Directive 5220.6, and informed \nApplicant by letter. (Hearing Exhibits (HE) I and II) Department Counsel mailed the \nproposed Government exhibits to Applicant two days later. (HE III) \nThe case was initially assigned to another DOHA administrative judge. On April \n20, 2022, DOHA issued a notice scheduling Applicant\u2019s hearing for May 17, 2022, to \noccur in person at a geographic location near where she lived and worked. On April 22, \n2022, Department Counsel provided Applicant copies of proposed Government exhibits, \nby mail, care of her employer\u2019s facility security officer (FSO) (also serving as Applicant\u2019s \npersonal representative). (HE IV) \nOn May 4, 2022, Applicant\u2019s personal representative requested a continuance so \nthat Applicant could schedule an assessment and provide supporting documentation as \npart of her case. On May 5, 2022, the initial administrative judge denied the request, \nlargely due to the age of the case (\u201cSince the SOR was issued over two years ago\u2026\u201d). \nHe noted that he would consider granting an extension of time after the hearing \u201cto await \nthe documents.\u201d (HE V) \nOn May 10, 2022, the case was assigned to me, after the initial administrative \njudge became unavailable due to a family matter, and I informed the parties of my \ninvolvement. When the in-person hearing convened on May 17, 2022, as initially \nscheduled, Applicant\u2019s personal representative appeared and indicated that Applicant \nwas not able to attend because she was feeling ill. I therefore continued the hearing until \ntwo days later, in the hopes that Applicant would be feeling better by that time. (May 17 \nTr. at 1-7) (Since the hearing took place in a location away from DOHA headquarters, \nissuance of an amended written hearing notice was not practical). \nThe hearing then re-convened on May 19, 2022, with all parties present, including \nDepartment Counsel, Applicant\u2019s personal representative, and Applicant, who was feeling \nbetter. (Tr. 10-12) The hearing then proceeded as scheduled. Department Counsel \nsubmitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant and her personal representative both testified. Applicant did not \nprovide any exhibits as part of her case. I left the record open for about six weeks, until \nJuly 6, 2022, to allow her the opportunity to submit additional evidence, specifically, an \nupdated psychological assessment.

As a \nresult, she wrote: \nWe have withdrawn our request for investigation in DISS. [Applicant] has \nnow been placed in a location where she is not required to have a security \nclearance. Thank you very much for your consideration in this matter. (HE \nVI) \nSince Applicant\u2019s hearing has already taken place, DOHA retains jurisdiction over \nthis case even though Applicant no longer has a need for access to classified information. \n(See \u00b6\u00b6 4.4 and 4.41 of Directive 5220.6, and as cited in HE VI). Issuance of this decision \nis therefore appropriate even though it appears that Applicant no longer requires a \nsecurity clearance. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the two SOR allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b) with brief comments. \nI have incorporated her admissions into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony and the exhibits, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 36 years old. She has a high school diploma and some technical \ntraining. (Tr. 26) She has never married. She has two 22-year-old twin sons, born when \nshe was 14 years old. One son lives with her, and one son lives in another state. (Tr. 40-\n41) Since May 2016, Applicant has worked as a custodian for a defense contractor. Her \njob involves cleaning offices on a U.S. military facility. She needs a security clearance so \nshe can access certain secure areas on the facility in order to do her job. (GE 1; Tr. 25-\n29) Applicant also works a night shift job, with her son, as a custodian with another \nemployer. (Tr. 41-42) \nIn February 2017, Applicant received a psychosocial assessment at behavioral \ninstitute W. She was assessed by a licensed master social worker (LMSW). Records \nindicated that she had received \u201cOP\u201d (Outpatient) treatment at the same facility in 2014-\n2015.

(SOR \u00b6 1.a) She noted depression and said she could not read due to dyslexia. \nShe reported that she had been physically abused by a boyfriend as a teen, and reported \nnightmares about prior abuse.

She did not appear for her \nappointment in March 2017, despite a call from the provider the day before. (GE 5) The \nFebruary 2017 assessment did not include a specific diagnosis. \nOn her May 2017 SCA, Applicant disclosed unspecified, lifelong mental health \ntreatment, noting that she had been \u201cAdmitted as inpatient.\u201d  (GE 1 at 24)  \nIn September 2019, during the course of Applicant\u2019s background investigation, the \nDOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) requested that she participate in a \npsychological evaluation. After a brief delay, Applicant scheduled an appointment for \nOctober 2019 and participated as requested. (GE 2, GE 3). \nThe psychological assessment was conducted by Dr. L, a Ph.D. licensed clinical \npsychologist and board-certified neuropsychologist. (GE 3, GE 4) The assessment \nincluded an interview of Applicant, as well as review of available records and analysis of \ncurrent psychological results. Only an oral clinical interview was conducted because \nApplicant said she could not read or write. (GE 3) \nDr. L diagnosed Applicant with \u201cschizophrenia, multiple episodes.\u201d She noted \nApplicant has a documented history of hallucinations and displays the negative symptoms \nof schizophrenia, including lack of facial expression, apathy, and dysphoria. Further, \n\u201calthough not observed to be psychotic during this evaluation, [Applicant] has a clear \nhistory of psychotic disorder, for which she is not being treated.\u201d (GE 3) (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \nDr. L concluded her report as follows: \nAs such, [Applicant] does have a condition that could impede her \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and judgment. Her prognosis is guarded, as she \nindicated she is unwilling to undergo mental health treatment. Therefore, \nthere is a significant likelihood of recurrence/exacerbation of psychotic \nsymptoms. (GE 3) (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \nIn answering the SOR in May 2020, Applicant admitted both allegations. As to SOR \n\u00b6 1.a (the 2017 assessment), she wrote, \u201cI agree. I sometimes see shadows of things.\u201d \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.b, she wrote, \u201cI agree. I have scheduled appointments with a psychologist \nto help with my condition will resume after shutdown.\u201d (Answer to SOR) \nApplicant testified that she went for the first assessment in 2017 because she told \nher family doctor that she was depressed and her doctor referred her for the assessment. \n(Tr. 32-33) She acknowledged that she did not go to the follow-up appointment; she said \nthey wanted her to take pills and she did not want to do that because pills make her \ndrowsy. They offered counseling instead but Applicant could not afford it since she did \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot have health insurance.

(Tr. 36) Applicant recalled meeting Dr. L one time, for about 30 minutes.; \u201cShe was \njust asking me a lot of questions.\u201d Applicant had not read the report prior to the hearing, \nbecause she cannot read. (Tr. 37) (The hearing was recessed for about 25 minutes so \nthat Applicant\u2019s personal representative could review the report with her) (Tr. 38-39) \nApplicant confirmed her answer to SOR \u00b6 1.b, that she had scheduled an \nappointment with a counselor and would pursue scheduling after the COVID-19 shutdown \nended. She was continuing to pursue that counseling or assessment with W at the time \nof the hearing, and said she had an appointment for June 25, 2022. (Tr. 44-45) That \nappointment did not occur, as her personal representative later advised (as noted above). \nApplicant said she has been dyslexic since she as a child. She acknowledged \n\u201ccomprehension problems.\u201d (Tr. 39) She said she prepared her written SOR response \nwith help from her personal representative. (Tr. 43) She also testified that she has a \ndriver\u2019s license and drives onto the facility where she works. (Tr. 28, 49-51) She \nrecognizes street signs and stop signs. She also said she can read at a third-grade level \nat most, and can recognize words like \u201cSecret,\u201d \u201cClassified,\u201d and \u201cUnclassified.\u201d (Tr. 48) \nShe said she has to see words \u201cover and over again\u201d to comprehend them. (Tr. 49) \nAt her hearing, Applicant said she is still working at the military facility, but is not \nallowed to enter secure areas. (Tr. 47-48, 53-55) She said she has been told by her \nsupervisor that if she has contact with classified information, \u201cI [am not] supposed to touch \nit, look at it, none of that.\u201d (Tr. 47) \u201cIf it\u2019s classified, we usually don\u2019t even go in those \nareas. . . I really don\u2019t have a problem with that because we [are] not allowed . . . as \ncustodians are not allowed in those areas.\u201d (Tr. 47) \u201cIf I had a clearance, it\u2019s different.\u201d \n(Tr. 48) She has gotten in trouble for attendance issues but not for security issues. (Tr. \n29-31) Applicant described the process by which she checks in on the base and in her \nassigned office, before proceeding to her duties. She said, \u201cI love my job because I love \nto clean.\u201d (Tr. 52) \nApplicant testified that she understood what her case was about. (Tr. 55-56) She \nsaid she has meetings with counselors every two or three months, and that it was hard to \nkeep regular sessions because of her work schedule. (Tr. 57) \nApplicant is not on any medication for her condition currently. She does not like \nthe way the medication makes her feel, since it makes her drowsy, which impacts her \nwork. Her doctor offered her counseling as an alternative. The last time she saw a \ncounselor, however was in 2019. (Tr. 58) Applicant acknowledged that her condition was \nsomething she has to deal with, either through counseling or medication.

She enjoys being around the people she works with because they \u201csharpen\u201d \n(i.e. stimulate) her. (Tr. 62) She wanted to join the Army but was not able to do so because \nof her disability. (Tr. 62) \nApplicant\u2019s personal representative also testified, both about her interactions with \nApplicant and as the employer\u2019s FSO. She has been the FSO for 15-20 years. She \nassisted Applicant with answering the SOR, and believes the assistant FSO aided \nApplicant in completing the SCA. Applicant does not need a clearance to get on the base, \nbut needs a clearance to access certain buildings without an escort. (Tr. 63-68) Applicant \nhas not had any reportable security incidents. (Tr. 71) \nApplicant was referred to her employer through a state employment program for \npeople with disabilities. (Tr. 69) Applicant\u2019s personal representative and FSO testified that \nApplicant is \u201cvery nice, very positive, and very easy-going. So she is the nice person that \nshe says she is.\u201d (Tr. 70) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988)) \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set forth in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 28. The following potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness.  \nIn 2019, Dr. L diagnosed Applicant with \u201cschizophrenia, multiple episodes.\u201d She \nnoted Applicant has a documented history of hallucinations. Dr. L noted that Applicant \nhas a \u201cclear history of psychotic disorder, for which she is not being treated.\u201d She \nconcluded that Applicant has a condition that could impede her trustworthiness, reliability, \nand judgment. Her prognosis is guarded, as she indicated she is unwilling to undergo \nmental \nhealth \ntreatment. \nTherefore, \nthere \nis \na \nsignificant \nlikelihood \nof \nrecurrence/exacerbation of psychotic symptoms. AG \u00b6 28(b) applies to the 2019 \nevaluation. (SOR \u00b6 1.b)  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 28(b) does not apply to SOR \u00b6 1.a, the February 2017 assessment, in which \nApplicant reported hearing voices and seeing things. No diagnosis was provided, though \nApplicant was recommended to pursue counseling, and did not do so. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 29, conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the\nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the\ntreatment plan; \n \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nApplicant was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2019. She has a condition that may \nimpact her judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability, and thus, her eligibility for a security \nclearance. While she has considered counseling, she has not actively followed up. \nAdmittedly, her ability to do so may be made more difficult by her work schedule, and by \nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on scheduling of counseling sessions. But she has \nnot shown that she has undertaken either counseling or appropriate medication which \nmight help her condition. She has not shown that there is no indication of a current \nproblem or that her condition is in the past, was temporary, has been resolved, is in \nremission, or is currently under control. It is her burden to do this. No mitigating conditions \napply to balance against Applicant\u2019s 2019 diagnosis of schizophrenia. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                  \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline I in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nApplicant has been employed as a custodian on a military facility. During her \nhearing, she displayed a good understanding of the restrictions placed on her at work \nsince she does not hold a clearance. She enjoys her job, and the people she meets there. \nShe likes cleaning. She presented at the hearing as a pleasant, cooperative, nice person. \nShe has also had a difficult life \u2013 pregnant with twins as a young teenager, abused, and \nwith a difficult upbringing. In 2019, she was diagnosed with schizophrenia, a \npsychological condition that could impact her judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability, \nand thus, her eligibility for a security clearance. She did not provide sufficient evidence to \nshow that her condition is either in the past, or that she is addressing it in an appropriate \nway, such as through medication or counseling. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

On August 6, 2020, the case was assigned to me. The \nprocessing of the case was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 12, 2022, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting \nthe hearing for June 15, 2022. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel offered four exhibits into evidence, and there were no \nobjections to Government Exhibits 1 and 4. (Tr. 15-16) Applicant objected to admission \nof her June 21, 2018 and November 19, 2019 credit reports because they were not the \nmost recent reports. (Tr. 16-17) Her objections were overruled because those reports are \nhistorical snapshots in time showing the status of her finances at the time the reports \nwere issued, and she was advised she could submit more recent evidence of the status \nof her debts. (Tr. 16) Department Counsel provided a June 15, 2022 credit report after \nthe hearing, and Applicant did not object to the admissibility of GE 5. (Tr. 16-17, 56-57; \nGE 5) In sum, Applicant did not provide any exhibits before her hearing, and all proffered \nexhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 15-16; GE 1-GE 5) \nOn June 27, 2022, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing. The record was \ninitially held open until July 15, 2022, to enable Applicant to provide documentation. (Tr. \n18-19, 52) During her hearing, Applicant said she had four letters describing her good \ncharacter that she wished to submit into evidence after her hearing. (Tr. 10-11, 19, 59) \nOn July 16, 2022, I sent Applicant an email advising her that I had not received any post-\nhearing documents, and I extended the suspense for her submission of documentary \nevidence until July 20, 2022. (HE 4) On July 19, 2022, she provided five exhibits, which \nwere admitted into evidence (Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-E). Her email forwarding her \nexhibits is AE F. The record closed on July 20, 2022. \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific\ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \n \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.j, 1.l through 1.q, and 1.s through 1.w. (HE 3) She denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k \nand 1.r. (Id.) She also provided mitigating information. (Id.) Her admissions are accepted \nas findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 43-year-old administrative secretary who has worked for DOD \ncontractors since July 2017.

(Tr. 23-24) She and her son moved in with her father and then \ninto a trailer park. (Tr. 25-26) Several of the SOR debts became delinquent in the 2013 \nto 2014 time period. (Tr. 25) After living in the area with her father for about 15 months, \nApplicant returned to the West Coast and obtained better employment. (Tr. 26) Her \ncurrent monthly net income is $4,200. (Tr. 45) She has a monthly remainder of roughly \nabout $1,000 left after paying her expenses and debts. (Tr. 47) She agreed to provide a \npersonal financial statement and five years of IRS Form 1040s to enable me to assess \nher income and available remainder after her hearing. (Tr. 51-52) After her hearing she \nprovided three character letters, a personal statement, and an email from a creditor. (AE \nA-AE E) Applicant wrote that after her hearing she contacted or attempted to contact \nseveral creditors on her SOR. (AE A) She received an email from one creditor that her \nemail was blocked. (AE A; AE E) She is in the process of moving to the state where her \nfather lives and intends to resign from her employment with the DOD contractor on August \n12, 2022. (AE A) \nThe SOR alleges 23 delinquent debts totaling $53,420 as follows: 1.a is a charged-\noff credit union debt for $3,268; 1.b, 1.u, and 1.v are Department of Education (D. Ed.) \nstudent loans placed for collection for $3,192, $1,864, and $4,482; 1.c is a debt placed \nfor collection for $2,788; 1.d, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.p are Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \ndebts placed for collection for $1,862, $474, $151, and $250; 1.e, 1.f, 1.s, and 1.t are \ndelinquent medical debts for $1,789, $1,332, $1,588, and $1,182; 1.g through 1.m are \naccounts placed for collection for $1,002, $733, $484, $437, $212, $208, and $1,018; 1.q \nand 1.r are accounts placed for collection for $6,704 and $818; and 1.w is a charged-off \ndebt resulting from a vehicle repossession for $17,892. (HE 2; GE 3) \nOn May 15, 2020, Applicant said she called the creditor for the charged-off credit \nunion debt in SOR 1.a for $3,268; however, all she received was a recording. (HE 3) She \nwas unable to reach the creditor to arrange a resolution. (Id.) At her hearing, she said she \ncontacted the creditor to set up a payment plan, and the creditor did not have a record of \nthe debt. (Tr. 38-39) She suggested the debt was dropped from her credit report. (Tr. 38) \nApplicant\u2019s June 15, 2022 credit report does not show this debt. (GE 5) \nApplicant\u2019s D. Ed. student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.u, and 1.v for $3,192, $1,864, \nand $4,482 were placed for collection. On May 22, 2019, Applicant told an Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) investigator that she was making $75 monthly payments \nto address the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.u and 1.v. (GE 4 at 2) On May 15, 2020, she said her \nstudent loan total was $4,574, and she said she submitted a financial hardship request to \nthe creditor. (HE 3) She said if the financial hardship request was denied, she intended \nto submit a request for a payment plan.

(Tr. 32-33) She disputed her \nresponsibility for the student-loan debt because she believed she was the victim of identity \ntheft when she was living with her father in 2013 to 2014. (Tr. 33-34) She did not apply \nfor the student loans, and she believed the college applied for them without her consent. \n(Tr. 33) However, her June 15, 2022 credit report reflects the student loans were \nborrowed in 2011, which was before she moved to assist her father. Two delinquent \nstudent loans are listed for $1,289 and $3,277. (GE 5 at 5) The high credit for the $1,289 \ndebt was $1,750, which is an indication of some payments, and the high credit for the \n$3,277 debt is $3,000. (Id.) The date for the most recent payment on either of the two \ndebts is February 2019. (Id.) At her hearing, she said she submitted the request for a \nrepayment plan about three months before her hearing. (Tr. 34) She said she would \nprovide her request for a payment plan after her hearing (Tr. 34); however, she did not \nprovide it. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c for $2,788 and 1.l for $208 are being collected by the same collection \nagent. On May 15, 2020, Applicant said she would contact the creditor in the next 30 days \nto make arrangements to pay the remaining balance. (HE 3) At her hearing, Applicant \nsaid the debt for $208 was paid in full, and she provided a confirmation number. (Tr. 37; \nSOR response, Encl. 2) She could not remember whether she ever addressed the debt \nfor $2,788. (Tr. 38) Applicant\u2019s June 15, 2022 credit report does not show a debt owed to \nthis collection agent. (GE 5) \nApplicant had four delinquent debts owed to the VA in connection with her \neducation expenses. (Tr. 37) On April 23, 2020, Applicant paid the VA debts placed for \ncollection in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.p for $1,862, $474, $151, and $250. (Tr. 35-36; \nSOR response, Encl. 3) Applicant\u2019s June 15, 2022 credit report does not show any debts \nowed to the VA. (GE 5) \nOn May 15, 2020, Applicant said she was seeking financial assistance to resolve \nthe four delinquent medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.s, and 1.t for $1,789, \n$1,332, $1,588, and $1,182. (HE 3) She said if she did not receive financial assistance, \nshe would pay $150 monthly until the debt is paid in full. (Id.) At her hearing, she said \nthe four debts were paid. (Tr. 30-31) Applicant\u2019s June 15, 2022 credit report does not \nshow any medical debts. (GE 5) \nFor the SOR debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.g through 1.k for $1,002, $733, $484, $437, and $212, \nApplicant mistakenly kept the equipment for television services when she moved. On May \n15, 2020, she said she planned to start payment plans for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i, \nand 1.j, and she planned to dispute the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k because she did not receive \nservices from the company. (HE 3) At her hearing, she said she paid the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.j for $733 and $437. (Tr. 41-42) Of the five debts, the only debt shown in her \nJune 15, 2022 credit report is her charged-off debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j for $437.

Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d    \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating\nconditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nApplicant experienced underemployment and illness in her family, which are \ncircumstances largely beyond her control. These circumstances adversely affected her \nfinances. However, \u201c[e]ven if applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in \npart, due to circumstances outside his [or her] control, the judge could still consider \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhether applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those \nfinancial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing \nISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 \n(App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \nAnother component under AG \u00b6 20(a) is whether Applicant maintained contact with \ncreditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. She did not \nprove that she maintained contact with several of her creditors and the timing and amount \nof any offers to make partial payments to them. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts have been either charged off or dropped \nfrom her credit report or both. \u201c[T]hat some debts have dropped off his [or her] credit \nreport is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. \nBd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The \nDOHA Appeal Board has explained why this is so: \n[T]here is more than one plausible explanation for debts dropping off a credit \nreport, such as the removal of debts due to the passage of time, and the absence \nof unsatisfied debts from an applicant\u2019s credit report does not extenuate or mitigate \nan overall history of financial difficulties or constitute evidence of financial reform \nor rehabilitation. \nISCR Case No. 19-03757 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2021) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-02957 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2017)). \nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most negative financial items \nfrom a credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency or the debt becoming \ncollection barred because of a state statute of limitations, whichever is longer. See Title \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission website, Summary of Fair Credit \nReporting Act Updates at Section 605, https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-\nfair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. Debts may be dropped from a credit report upon dispute \nwhen creditors believe the debt is not going to be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond \nto a credit reporting company\u2019s request for information, or when the debt has been \ncharged off. Applicant\u2019s failure to provide more evidence of debt resolution precludes \nmitigation of the charged-off debts on her credit report.  \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \nApplicant mitigated seven SOR debts and reduced the SOR debt total to $45,419. \nThe following SOR debts are not listed on her June 15, 2022 credit report and they are \nmitigated for the following additional reasons: 1.b for $3,192 and 1.u for $1,864 are \nmitigated because they are duplications of and merged into the student-loan debt in 1.v \nfor $4,482; the debt in 1.l for $208 is mitigated because she said it was paid, and it may \nhave been a payment for the debt in 1.c for $2,788; and the VA debts in 1.d, 1.n, 1.o, and \n1.p for $1,862, $474, $151, and $250 are mitigated because she provided proof that she \npaid them.  \nThe remaining SOR debts are not mitigated because Applicant did not provide \nproof of payment plans, payments, releases or forgiveness of indebtedness, or \ndocumentation sent to the creditor disputing the debts. For example, she said she had \nmonthly payment plans and made payments to pay the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q for $6,704 \nand 1.w for $17.582. She said she paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.q and made 36 monthly \npayments of $230 to address the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.w. She failed to provide proof of these \npayments. \u201cIn this regard, the Appeal Board has previously stated that it is reasonable for \na Judge to expect an applicant to present documentation corroborating actions taken to \nresolve debts.\u201d ISCR Case No. 19-03757 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2021) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020)). \nApplicant did not establish that she was unable to make more documented \nprogress resolving her delinquent debts. She did not provide a budget or other \ndocumentation about her financial resources or show she was unable to make greater \nprogress resolving her delinquent SOR debts. She did not provide readily available \ndocumentation to support her claims of payments to address several large debts. There \nis insufficient assurance that her financial problems will not recur in the future. Under all \nthe circumstances, she failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 43-year-old administrative secretary who has worked for DOD \ncontractors since July 2017. She honorably served in the Navy from 1996 to 2010, and \nshe was a petty officer second class when she left active duty. Her Navy specialty was \nYeoman. Applicant\u2019s finances were adversely affected in 2013 and 2014 when she was \nunderemployed. Most of her delinquent SOR debts are not listed on her June 15, 2022 \ncredit report. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial at this time. \nThe SOR alleges 23 delinquent debts totaling $53,420. Applicant mitigated seven SOR \ndebts and reduced the SOR delinquent debt total to $45,419. She had ample time to \ngather documentation to support her claims of paying several of the large debts. She did \nnot provide documentation showing a track record of consistent payments to address 16 \nSOR debts. Her financial history raises unmitigated questions about her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards documented resolution of her past-due debts, and a better track \nrecord of behavior consistent with her obligations, she may well be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of her security clearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec.

(GE 1 through 5; SOR \nAnswer) \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began in 2009 when his business partner and vice \npresident of his former business suddenly departed leaving him responsible for all \noperations and company debt. His company lost a major contract that was eventually \nreplaced by a much less profitable contract. Applicant estimates this business loss \ncaused his salary to be reduced from \u201cabout 120 (thousand dollars a year)\u201d to \u201caround \n80 (thousand dollars a year). This unplanned income loss placed Applicant in a \nprecarious financial position, \u201cit was either pay rent and bills or . . . not doing anything \nelse.\u201d Added to that, Applicant\u2019s state of residence began garnishing his wages for non-\npayment of state taxes. (Tr. 34-36) \nIn his SOR Answer, Applicant\u2019s explanation for not filing his Federal and state \nincome tax returns from 2012 to 2018 was, \u201cThis situation occurred due to me owing \ntaxes and being unable to pay them at the time. I let the time lapse and eventually fell in \nto being paranoid and afraid to reach out to the IRS and [state tax authority] to pay the \ntaxes and bring my returns up to date. I realize that was not the correct response.\u201d \n(SOR Answer) He added during his hearing, \u201cSo, that initially is just because I just kept \ngetting scared because I had that initial tax burden and it just left me in paralysis.\u201d (Tr. \n36-37) Going forward, Applicant stated that he intends to file his taxes in a timely \nmanner.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets \nas well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations;\u201d and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax as required.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). Further inquiry is necessary about the potential \napplication of any mitigation conditions. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue;  \n \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th\nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The\nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \n[full cite here] Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of \nthe national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. His debt \nremains a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See \nISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd.

His 2009 loss of income no doubt played a role in \nhis ability to remain current on his established obligations at that time. However, \nApplicant does not receive full credit under either of these two mitigating conditions \nbecause of his failure to act responsibly under the circumstances and the time elapsed \nbefore addressing these four debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) are not applicable. \nOf greater concern is the fact that Applicant did not timely file his Federal and \nstate income tax returns from 2012 to 2018. Applicant was alerted to the fact that his \nfailure to file these returns was a concern to the Government during his October 2019 \nOPM PSI and later when he received his April 2020 SOR. These events apparently did \nnot prompt Applicant to recognize the seriousness of his situation and take immediate \ncorrective action. He ultimately filed his Federal and state income tax returns; however, \nhe did not begin to do so until the eve of his hearing and five of his returns were not filed \nuntil after his hearing. His explanation of being scared to file his returns and concerned \nabout the amount he would owe is not a convincing explanation for an individual of his \nage and experience. Yet, he did not hesitate to purchase a $46,000 recreational vehicle \nduring a seven-year period of non-tax filing compliance. Such a lapse in judgment \ncannot be overlooked, especially from an individual whose income is derived from tax \ndollars. The evidence demonstrates that Applicant did not act responsibly with regard to \ntimely filing his Federal income tax returns and paying or making payment \narrangements for taxes owed. \nIn regard to the failure to timely file Federal income tax returns when due, the \nDOHA Appeal Board has commented in ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. \n15, 2016): \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C.

Applying the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are not \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant or continue national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the \nAnalysis section under Guideline F is incorporated in this whole-person section. \nHowever, further comments are warranted. \nTo review, Applicant is a 42-year-old senior technical specialist, who has been \nemployed by a defense contractor since August 2017. He has spent most of his adult \nlife as an active-duty Marine and later working as a civilian employee in support of the \ndefense industry. He has successfully held a clearance since 1998. He seeks to retain \nhis security clearance as a requirement of his continued employment. He is highly \nregarded and respected by his employer and peers. Applicant is married and has two \nchildren. He has all the indicators of an upwardly mobile individual with a bright future \nahead of him. \nHowever, for at least seven years, he has failed to grasp the importance of one \nof the fundamental hallmarks of U.S. citizenship, which is the timely filing of his Federal \nand state income tax returns and paying taxes when due. This is especially crucial for \nan individual seeking to retain a security clearance and working for a defense contractor \nadvancing the national security of the United States. From the evidence presented, \ndespite being made aware that the timely filing of his Federal and state income tax \nreturns was a security concern, Applicant failed to comply with this basic and \nfundamental civic obligation. He is a bright and talented individual, who is more than \ncapable of addressing his income tax problems in a responsible way. This decision \nshould not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the \nstate of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. With more \neffort towards establishing a track record of financial responsibility, and a better track \n10 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \nrecord of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

The case was assigned to \nme on August 4, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I \nmake the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 34 years old, never married, and has no children. He is a college. \ngraduate. According to Applicant\u2019s February 18, 2019 SCA, since November 2017, he \nhas been employed continuously by a defense contractor. (Item 2.) According to his April \n25, 2019 Personal Subject Interview (PSI), however, Applicant had two surgeries in \nMarch 2018. He was in recovery for several months and had difficulty returning to work. \nAs a result, Applicant left his employment in June 2018. (Item 3.) Notwithstanding this \ndiscrepancy, as of September 26, 2022, he was sponsored by the most recent employer \nidentified in his SCA. \nThe SOR alleged nine delinquent debts, three student loans totaling $42,079 and \nsix medical debts totaling $3,798. (SOR.) \nAll three student loans were reported \ndelinquent in February 2019. (Item 4.) \n   Student Loans \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. is a federal student loan for $23,328. Applicant admitted this allegation \nbut said: \u201c[It] is in good standing and up to date in payments.\u201d He provided no documents \nin support of his answer. (Answer.) The record shows this loan to be in collection and \n\u201cPERMANENTLY ASSIGNED TO GOVERNMENT.\u201d (Item 4.) In subsequent credit \nreports, there are no federal student loans with an account number or a balance due that \nmatch this account. All federal student loans that are reported show zero amounts due. \n(Items 5 and 6.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. is a federal student loan for $10,288. Applicant denied this debt and \nsaid: \u201cI believe this was part of the [private lender] account that I paid off.\u201d He provided \nno documents in support of his answer. (Answer.) The record shows this loan to be in \ncollection and \u201cPERMANENTLY ASSIGNED TO GOVERNMENT.\u201d (Item 4.) The next \ncredit report shows the loan charged off for $8,463. (Item 5.) The last credit report shows \nthis loan charged off for $8,463. (Item 6.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. is a private student loan for $8,463. Applicant admitted this allegation \nand said: \u201c[Was] paid off with a settlement with a balance of $0.00.\u201d He provided no \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndocuments in support of his answer.

In the \nMarch 2019 credit report, the balance was $10,158, and the loan was charged off for \n$8,463 in October 2016. (Item 4.) The next credit report (January 2020) shows this loan \ncharged off for $8,463. (Item 5.) The last credit report (April 2022) shows the loan was \ncharged off for $8,463. (Item 6.) \nThere appears to be some relationship between SOR \u00b6 1.b. and SOR \u00b6 1.c. On \nthis record, however, it is not clear what that relationship is. \n    Medical Debts \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent medical debts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. through 1.i. totaling \n$3,798. Applicant admitted these debts, with varying comments such as: \u201c[Is] in good \nstanding with paying this off\u201d; \u201c[Has] been paid and closed out\u201d; \u201c[In] good standing in \nmaking payments and is paying off.\u201d (Answer.) Applicant provided no documents in \nsupport of his answers. The March 2019 credit report shows all of these debts in \ncollection. (Item 4.) The January 2020 and April 2022 credit reports do not report on \nthese debts. \nIn her FORM Brief, Department Counsel notes two delinquent debts that are not \nalleged in the SOR, one an auto loan for $69 and one a medical judgment for $1,115. \n(FORM Brief at 3, citing Items 4, 6, and 7.) Only the medical judgment is material here. \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM, so he did not address those unalleged \nallegations. They are, therefore, deemed to have been denied. The record supports the \nmedical judgment. (Item 7.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following condition is applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 20 is potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s three student loans were reported delinquent in February 2019. That is \nnot that long ago. Nor were the delinquencies infrequent, as proven by the record\u2019s three \ncredit reports. As the record stands, Applicant\u2019s first student loan is in collection, and his \nsecond and third loans have been charged off. Although he claims that those debts have \nbeen resolved, Applicant has not provided any documents supporting that assertion. The \nAppeals Board has routinely held that it is reasonable to expect applicants to produce \ndocumentation supporting their efforts to resolve debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-\n00615 at 2 (Jun. 7, 2021). Applicant has not satisfied that requirement. AG \u00b6 20(a) does \nnot mitigate his student loans. No other mitigating conditions appear to be applicable on \nthis record.   \nApplicant\u2019s medical debts for $4,913 (which includes the unalleged medical \njudgment) stand on a different footing. I have given little weight to the seven delinquent \nmedical accounts that remain unresolved. Medical debt is unlike other types of debt. First, \nit is presumed that medical debt is incurred for necessary medical care and treatment, as \nopposed to frivolous irresponsible spending, or otherwise living beyond one\u2019s means. \nSecond, medical debt is usually unplanned, unexpected, and nondiscretionary. Third, it \ncan add hundreds if not thousands of dollars in debt in a short period, which can be \noverwhelming for a debtor. Finally, the record shows that Applicant lost time from work due \nto two surgeries in March 2018. In my view, having less than $5,000 in unresolved medical \naccounts does not fatally undermine Applicant\u2019s suitability. Accordingly, the allegations in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. through 1.i. are decided for Applicant. \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). The unalleged medical judgment \nwas considered in my whole-person analysis. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. \nBd. Oct. 26, 2006). In my analysis, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions and the whole-person concept in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with questions about his eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n5 \n\n \n \n \n      Subparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 c.:  \n \n \n          Against Applicant \n \n \n      Subparagraphs 1.d. \u2013 i.:   \n                             For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has worked since July 2018. He earned a high school diploma in 2006 and has taken community college and college courses for several years without earning a degree. He is currently attending a trade school. He has not been married and has no children. (Items 2, 3) The SOR alleges Applicant owes two delinquent loans totaling about $76,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b). SOR \u00b6 1.a is a car loan and SOR \u00b6 1.b is a student loan. Applicant denies both debts in his response to the SOR because he alleged he is making monthly payments on the former and he cannot locate the creditor in order to address the latter. Nevertheless, the SOR allegations are established through the Government\u2019s evidence. (Items 2-6) The delinquent auto loan for $34,707 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a has not been resolved. In his response to the SOR, Applicant provided documentary evidence that, between January 2020 and April 2022, he paid $50 per week on an account to the same creditor as that listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a. However, this documentation reflects that the account being paid is a student loan account. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is an auto loan, so there is no proof that these payments concern the account in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Furthermore, there is no documentary proof that any payments have been made on this account since about 2014, the last activity date listed on the August 2019 credit report.

SOR \u00b6 1.a is a car loan and SOR \u00b6 1.b is a student loan. Applicant \ndenies both debts in his response to the SOR because he alleged he is making monthly \npayments on the former and he cannot locate the creditor in order to address the latter. \nNevertheless, the SOR allegations are established through the Government\u2019s evidence. \n(Items 2-6) \nThe delinquent auto loan for $34,707 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a has not been \nresolved. In his response to the SOR, Applicant provided documentary evidence that, \nbetween January 2020 and April 2022, he paid $50 per week on an account to the \nsame creditor as that listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a. However, this documentation reflects that the \naccount being paid is a student loan account. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is an auto loan, so \nthere is no proof that these payments concern the account in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Furthermore, \nthere is no documentary proof that any payments have been made on this account \nsince about 2014, the last activity date listed on the August 2019 credit report. (Items 1-\n3, 5) \nThe delinquent student loan for $42,494 in SOR \u00b6 1.b has not been resolved. \nApplicant claimed that he has been unable to locate the creditor in order to attempt to \nresolve this debt. He does not provide evidence, documentary or otherwise, about what \nsteps he has taken to locate the creditor other than to discuss it with the creditor of \nanother one of his student loans. This debt appears on the May 2022 credit report which \nreflects a last payment date of April 2018. I take administrative notice that all federal \nstudent loans were eligible for placement in a deferment status as of late March 2020 at \nthe earliest. Therefore, available evidence shows that Applicant was delinquent on this \ndebt prior to any placement in a deferment status. Applicant does not provide evidence \nthat the weekly payments that he believes he has been making on the debt on SOR \u00b6 \n1.a are, in fact, being applied to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant acknowledged having \nother student loan accounts and the account number listed on the documents Applicant \nprovided does not match the account number for the student loan in SOR \u00b6 1.b.  \n(Items 1-4, 6) \nApplicant claims that he fell behind on his debts because of underemployment. \nHe claims that now that he has his current job, he has enough money to meet his \nfinancial obligations and enough money to save for an emergency fund. He did not \nprovide any information about his income or expenses to support this claim. Applicant \ndid not respond to the FORM, so more recent information about his finances is not \navailable.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s delinquent SOR debts remain unpaid or unresolved. The \nevidence shows that the last payment on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a was made in 2014. He \nhas a history of unpaid debts. The above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nAlthough President Biden extended a pause on the collection of student loans \ndue to COVID-19, thus creating a deferment period on student-loan payments \n(https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/pausing-\nfederal-student-loan-payments/), that action does not excuse previously delinquent \nstudent loans. See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\n \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \nThe delinquencies are ongoing and therefore recent. The evidence does not \nshow that the debts are resolved or are under control. Applicant\u2019s delinquencies were \ncaused by underemployment, which is arguably beyond his control. However, while \nApplicant provided documents to show that he has been making payments on a debt to \nthe same creditor as the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, he has not established that those payments \nare being made on the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He has not provided sufficient \nevidence, documentary or otherwise, to show what efforts he has taken to locate the \ncreditor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. It is reasonable to expect Applicant to present \ndocumentation about the resolution of specific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). Therefore, Applicant has not shown that he has \nacted responsibly under the circumstances or that he is acting in good faith to pay or \notherwise resolve the SOR debts. While Applicant denies these debts in his response to \nthe SOR because he either believes they are being addressed (SOR \u00b6 1.a), or cannot \naddress them (SOR \u00b6 1.b), for the reasons I already provided, these disputes are not \nreasonable. The financial considerations security concern is not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Except as addressed below, the debts are \nestablished through credit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions. \nApplicant filed his federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2017 on time, \nbut he mistakenly misreported his income. The IRS issued a refund of $1,108 in \nFebruary 2018, but assessed additional taxes in 2019. Applicant made payments \ntotaling $70 in September and October 2019, and $50 was withheld from his 2018 \nrefund. The balance, with penalties and interest, in February 2020 was $3,324 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.o). Applicant entered into an installment agreement with the IRS in March 2020 in \nwhich he agreed to pay $50 per month. He made all of the required payments. \nAdditionally, $1,226 was withheld from his 2019 refund in April 2020, and $111 was \nwithheld from his 2020 refund in June 2021.

He \nshowed her his lease, which did not have a breed restriction. She threatened to evict \nhim. His lease was up shortly thereafter, so he did not think much of it. He stated that \nthe landlord never sent him a letter claiming he owed anything, and the first he heard \nabout the debt was when it showed up on his credit report.

(AE K) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \ndischarge, multiple delinquent debts, and unpaid federal income tax taxes. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n19(c), and 19(f) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant and his wife both had periods of unemployment and underemployment. \nHe also admitted that he was young and ignorant about finances. \nApplicant entered into an installment agreement with the IRS in March 2020. He \nmade all of the required $50 payments. Additional funds were withheld from his 2019 \nand 2020 refunds, and in May 2022, he paid $828 to completely pay the back federal \ntaxes. He also paid his back state income taxes. He paid some of the SOR debts and \nseveral debts that were not alleged in the SOR. He disputed some debts, and he is still \nin the process of addressing others. The charged-off auto loan is the only delinquent \naccount reflected on his most recent credit report. The other SOR debts were paid and \nremoved by the creditor, successfully disputed, or simply aged off his credit report. He \ncredibly testified that he intends to continue to pay his debts. \nFinancial cases by their nature involve amounts and figures, but there is no \nmagic number, percentage, equation, or algorithm that can be used to determine \nwhether an applicant has done enough to show that his or her finances are sufficiently \nin order to warrant a security clearance. It is a case by case determination, wherein the \ncause of the financial problems and how an applicant has reacted to those problems, \nalong with many other factors, are evaluated. The process is not designed to ensure \nthat debts are collected; the process is deigned to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s finances are not perfect, but perfection is not required. He acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances and made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His \nfinances do not cast doubt on his current judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nability to protect classified information.

Security concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.p: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 60 years old and married with three children. He has a Master\u2019s degree. Applicant is employed by a defense contractor as a Program Manager and is seeking to retain a security clearance in relation to his employment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 25.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR alleged that Applicant had five past-due student loan debts totaling approximately $227,311 (SOR 1.a through 1.e). Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR with explanations. Support for the existence and amounts of these debts is found in credit reports dated November 25, 2019; and May 23, 2022. (Government Exhibits 3 and 4.) Applicant stated that he took these loans out to provide a college education to his oldest child. She graduated in 2016. Repayment of the student loans was to begin in 2017. That did not happen. He stated that in 2018 he began to get default notices on these loans. He believed they were in error due to his daughter being on a mission for her church and ignored them. Applicant did not begin to make payments until 2018. He made one payment of $600 in 2018 and 4 payments of $600 in 2019. The last payment in 2019 appears to have been in May. (Applicant Exh",

Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non September 15, 2021. I was assigned the case on April 12, 2022. The Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on April 18, 2022. The case \nwas heard on May 31, 2022. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on June 9, \n2022. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 4, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibit A, \nwhich was also admitted without objection. He asked that the record remain open for the \nreceipt of additional documentation. Applicant timely submitted Applicant Exhibits B and \nC, which were admitted without objection. (Applicant Exhibits B and C are split into three \nsubparts identified by initials. Citations will be to the exhibit and subpart, if necessary.) \nThe record closed on July 8, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 60 years old and married with three children. He has a Master\u2019s \ndegree. Applicant is employed by a defense contractor as a Program Manager and is \nseeking to retain a security clearance in relation to his employment. (Government Exhibit \n1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 25.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had five past-due student loan debts totaling \napproximately $227,311 (SOR 1.a through 1.e). Applicant admitted all the allegations in \nthe SOR with explanations. Support for the existence and amounts of these debts is found \nin credit reports dated November 25, 2019; and May 23, 2022. (Government Exhibits 3 \nand 4.) \nApplicant stated that he took these loans out to provide a college education to his \noldest child. She graduated in 2016. Repayment of the student loans was to begin in \n2017. That did not happen. He stated that in 2018 he began to get default notices on \nthese loans. He believed they were in error due to his daughter being on a mission for \nher church and ignored them. Applicant did not begin to make payments until 2018. He \nmade one payment of $600 in 2018 and 4 payments of $600 in 2019. The last payment \nin 2019 appears to have been in May.

They weren\u2019t paid. If \nthey weren\u2019t paid, they weren\u2019t paid. But I don\u2019t have a particular reason why they weren\u2019t \npaid.\u201d Regarding repayment of the student loan debt in general he said, \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a \ngood reason.\u201d He also testified that he always had the financial ability to make monthly \npayments of $600. (Tr. 35, 55, 57.) \nApplicant stated he did not make payments in 2020 or 2021 due to the student \nloan payment deferments enacted because of the Covid pandemic. Applicant has not \nspoken to anyone at the Department of Education (DoE) about his loans since 2021. He \nadmitted his contact with DoE has been sporadic. He submitted emails from the DoE that \ndo discuss suspension of loan payments in 2020 through 2022. (Applicant Exhibit B at \nMG-5 and MG-7; Applicant Exhibit C at MG-6; Tr. 35-38, 49-52.) \nApplicant discussed the fact that he had prepared and submitted a \u201cLoan \nRehabilitation and Expense Information\u201d form to DoE in 2019. After the hearing, he \nsubmitted a copy of that document. He stated that the form was submitted, but he had no \ndocumentation to support a statement that the DoE had accepted the form or arranged \nfor a payment agreement. (Applicant Exhibit C at MG-4; Tr. 37.) \nApplicant stated that he had begun making regular payments on this loan in 2022 \nfor the months of January through May. After the hearing he provided documentation from \nhis bank showing that five checks of $600 each were cashed by the DoE in May 2022. It \nis noted that the checks have sequential serial numbers, were received for processing \nthe same day, and all cleared his bank on May 31, 2022, the same day as the hearing. \nHe submitted evidence showing that he had made one additional payment. He stated that \nhe will continue to make monthly payments of $600 on these loans into the future. He \nadmitted that payments on this loan in the past were \u201csporadic.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit B at \nMG-1, MG-2; Tr. 19, 31-33.) \nApplicant testified that he had another student loan go into default and eventually \na judgment was entered against him and his paycheck was garnished. However, he was \nvery vague on the particulars of the garnishment until he submitted documentation after \nthe hearing. (Government Exhibit 2 at 4, 7-8; Applicant Exhibit B at SC-4 through SC-6; \nTr. 17-18, 26-31.) \nApplicant also admitted that he has gone \u201ca couple years\u201d without filing his tax \nreturns several times in the past. An investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement interviewed applicant in January 2019. Applicant stated in the interview that \nhe had not filed his 2016 or 2017 tax returns in a timely fashion. (Government Exhibit 2 \nat 3; Tr. 54-55.) \nApplicant testified that he had paid out of pocket for the education of his second \nchild, who has since graduated. He is currently paying for his youngest child and wife to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nattend community college.

(Answer; Applicant Exhibit A; \nApplicant Exhibit B at SC-1 through SC-8; Applicant Exhibit B at LPC-1 through LPC-3; \nTr. 17-20.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant owed approximately $227,000 for five past-due student loan as of the \ndate the SOR was issued. He testified that he had the financial ability to pay these student \nloans in a timely manner but failed to do so. These facts establish prima facie support for \nthe foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those \nconcerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s admitted financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe evidence of record does not support application of any of the above mitigating \nconditions. Applicant\u2019s attitude towards these substantial debts was lackadaisical at best. \nHe admitted that he had no excuse for his failure to keep up regular payments before \nCovid. Even accounting for Covid there is no record of consistent payments over a \nsubstantial period. He stated that he had the financial ability to keep up the payments; it \njust was not a priority for him. Rather, his priority was paying out of pocket for the \neducation of his other two children and his wife. While that may be laudable, that is no \nexcuse for neglecting this debt. There has not been a good-faith effort to repay this debt. \nHis conduct does not show that he has acted responsibly in attempting to resolve the \ndebt. Based on the available evidence I cannot say with any degree of certainty that \nApplicant will not continue to ignore this debt in the future if he believes other expenses \nare more important. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his financial situation. He has minimized neither the potential for \npressure, coercion, or duress, nor the likelihood of recurrence. Overall, the record \nevidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, but denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.e, 2.a-2.e, 3.a, and 3.b. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 46-year-old electrical engineer employed by a defense contractor since October 2018. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from October 1997 to October 2001 and received an honorable discharge. He has worked for defense contractors since August 2003, with short periods of unemployment when he was laid off in 2016 and 2017. He held a security clearance in the Navy, which was renewed in 2008. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2015 and has been enrolled in online college courses since 2015. Applicant married in January 2001 and has four children, ages 29, 23, 19, and 17. During the PSI, the investigator asked him if he had any additional family members that he had not listed in his SCA. He volunteered that he did not list a twin brother, who is a transient moving around in the west coast of the United States, with whom he has no contact. He gave the investigator no specific explanation for not listing his twin brother. (FORM Item 12 at 5.) Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges five delinquent debts. Applicant admitted the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a (a debt charged off for $20,594) and SOR \u00b6 1.b (a debt charged off for $10,127).

On July 8, 2022, a complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections \nand submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He \nreceived the FORM on July 14, 2022, and did not respond. The case was assigned to me \non October 3, 2022. \nThe FORM Item 12 is a summary of a personal subject interview (PSI) conducted \nby a security investigator in April 2019. The PSI summary was not authenticated as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. When the FORM was sent to Applicant in July 2022, \nDepartment Counsel informed him that he was entitled to comment on the accuracy of \nthe PSI summary; make any corrections, additions, deletions or updates; or object to \nconsideration of the PSI summary on the ground that it was not authenticated. I conclude \nthat he waived any objections to the PSI summary by failing to respond to the FORM. \n\u201cAlthough pro se applicants are not expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to \ntake timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b, but denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.e, 2.a-2.e, 3.a, and 3.b. His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 46-year-old electrical engineer employed by a defense contractor \nsince October 2018. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from October 1997 to \nOctober 2001 and received an honorable discharge. He has worked for defense \ncontractors since August 2003, with short periods of unemployment when he was laid off \nin 2016 and 2017. He held a security clearance in the Navy, which was renewed in 2008. \nHe earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2015 and has been enrolled in online college courses \nsince 2015. \nApplicant married in January 2001 and has four children, ages 29, 23, 19, and 17. \nDuring the PSI, the investigator asked him if he had any additional family members that \nhe had not listed in his SCA. He volunteered that he did not list a twin brother, who is a \ntransient moving around in the west coast of the United States, with whom he has no \ncontact. He gave the investigator no specific explanation for not listing his twin brother. \n(FORM Item 12 at 5.) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges five delinquent debts. Applicant admitted the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a (a debt charged off for $20,594) and SOR \u00b6 1.b (a debt \ncharged off for $10,127). He claimed that he had a payment plan for the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a and that he was making payments on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b.

He told the investigator that he had never used those names and could \nprovide no information explaining why those names were associated with him. (FORM \nItem 12 at 1.) \nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to all the financial questions in Section 26 of his SCA. In \nhis answer to the SOR, he denied the two delinquent telecommunications accounts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d and the insurance company debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, \nand he claimed that he had communicated his dispute to the alleged creditors. \nDuring the PSI, Applicant was confronted with numerous debts. He admitted the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and told the investigator that he did not think he was required \nto list it in his SCA because he had contacted the creditor and discussed a payment plan. \nHe told the investigator that he did not disclose the credit-card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b \nbecause it was the result of fraud. According to Applicant, he had obtained this credit card \nfor his spouse to use when he was deployed outside the United States. After an overseas \ndeployment, he noticed numerous charges that he believed were fraudulent. He told the \ninvestigator that he disputed those charges and they were removed from the account. \nAccording to Applicant, the card issuer issued a new card and transferred about $6,000 \nin undisputed charges to the new card, which was issued in his spouse\u2019s name only and \nwas paid in full. (FORM Item 12 at 7.) \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b was based on a credit report from December 2020 \nreflecting that the debt was opened in January 2015 and charged off in December 2020. \n(FORM Item 4 at 1.) In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he responded to this allegation by \nsubmitting a document reflecting a payment on an account in his name only, with a \ndifferent account number than the account listed in the December 2020 credit report, on \nwhich SOR \u00b6 1.a was based. The documentation does not support Applicant\u2019s claims in \nthe PSI that the fraudulent account was closed, that a new account was opened in his \nspouse\u2019s name only, and that it was paid in full. \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he denied having accounts with the creditors \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e, and he stated that he had contacted the creditors \nand disputed the validity of the debts. In the PSI, he claimed that he had no knowledge \nof these debts. (FORM Item 12 at 6.) The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d are \nreflected in the July 2019 credit report (which is annotated with a fraud alert), but the \ninsurance debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e is not reflected. (FORM Item 5.) The debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e are not reflected in the January 2021 credit report. (FORM \nItem 4.) They are too recent to have aged off the credit reports in accordance with the \nFair Credit Report Act, indicating that Applicant\u2019s dispute may have been resolved in his \nfavor, especially in light of the identity fraud investigation discussed below. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleges the following: \nSOR \u00b6 2a: That in July 2020, Applicant was charged with possession of \ncontrolled drugs and pleaded guilty to a lesser offense;  \nSOR \u00b6 2.b: That on four occasions between August 2020 and June 2021, \nhe was charged with possession of a controlled drug;  \nSOR \u00b6 2.c: That on eight occasions between May 2020 and May 2021, he \nwas charged with trespass not amounting to burglary;  \nSOR \u00b6 2.d: That on five occasions between January 2019 and August 2021,\nhe was charged with entering a state in western United States without\nregistering with local law enforcement authorities; and  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.e: That he had engaged in banking transactions consistent with \nmoney laundering. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he denied all these allegations. In February \n2002, he filed an identity-theft complaint after receiving correspondence from the IRS \nabout his income. His complaint was that someone was using his identify to apply for \njobs. He filed another complaint in February 2008 after being notified by the IRS that his \nincome was $23,000 more than he had reported. In August 2009, he filed another \ncomplaint that his estranged twin brother was using his identify to obtain loans and other \nfinancial gains. In October 2011, he filed another complaint after his driver\u2019s license was \n\u201con hold\u201d because another person had obtained a driver\u2019s license in his name in an \nadjoining state. The adjoining state determined that Applicant was a victim of identity \nfraud. \nIn August 2015, Applicant\u2019s employer obtained an investigation of his backgound \nfrom a civilian agency. The results of that investigation were attached to Applicant\u2019s \nanswer to the SOR. The investigation showed that a person using Applicant\u2019s name had \na long arrest and conviction record in two adjoining states in western United States. \nApplicant\u2019s estranged twin brother lives in one of those states. Applicant lives and works \nin southeast United States. In April 2019, Applicant supplied fingerprints to the FBI and \nasked for a criminal record check. The FBI found that he has no arrest data at the FBI. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . Affluence that cannot be explained \nby known sources of income is also a security concern insofar as it may \nresult from criminal activity, including espionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. and \nAG \u00b6 19(g): unexplained affluence, as shown by a lifestyle or standard of \nliving, increase in net worth, or money transfers that are inconsistent with \nknown legal sources of income. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM are sufficient to raise AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). AG \u00b6 19(g) is not raised, because the evidence of money laundering \nwas refuted by the evidence of identity theft. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. The debts alleged in the SOR are recent, numerous, \nand did not occur under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, which \nApplicant admitted. It is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e, \nwhich were the result of identity theft, a condition largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he claimed that \nhe was making payments on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. In the PSI, he claimed that \nhe had contacted the creditor about a payment plan. He submitted no documentary \nevidence to support his claims. When an applicant claims that a debt is being resolved, \nhe or she is expected to present documentary evidence supporting that claim. See ISCR \nCase No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, which \nhe admitted. It is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e, which he \nsuccessfully disputed as fraudulent. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d \nThe following disqualifying conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nNeither disqualifying condition is established. The evidence establishes that \nApplicant does not have a criminal record and that a person using his name in a \ngeographical area where Applicant does not live or work committed all the offenses \nalleged in the SOR. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his SCA by deliberately failing to disclose \nthe delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e, and it cross-alleges the money \nlaundering alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.e. \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;. \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . a pattern of dishonesty or \nrule violations; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group.

An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nApplicant is a mature adult who has completed the adjudication process at least \ntwice during his career. He knew that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b had been \ncharged off. His claim that he was resolving the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is unsupported \nby documentary evidence. His claim that he was making payments on the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b also is unsupported by documentary evidence. Instead, he submitted evidence \nof payments on another account that was not alleged in the SOR. \nBased on all the evidence, I conclude that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose \nthe delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and that the disqualifying condition \nin AG \u00b6 16(a) is established. The disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) add 16(e) are \nnot established, for the same reasons set out in the above discussions of Guidelines F \nand J. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant did not attempt to correct the omission \nuntil he was confronted with the evidence during the PSI. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s falsification is arguably infrequent, but it \nwas recent and did not happen under unique circumstances. It was not minor, because \nfalsification of a security clearance application \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security \nclearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd.

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F, J, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered \nApplicant\u2019s honorable military service and long career as an employee of defense \ncontractors. I have also considered the stressful circumstances he endured due to identify \ntheft, apparently at the hands of his estranged twin brother. Because he requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor or to question him about the allegations in \nthe SOR. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003).After weighing \nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F, J, and E, and evaluating \nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has refuted the \nallegations under Guideline J, but he has not mitigated the security concerns under \nGuidelines F and E. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e: \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nLeRoy F.

Clearance eligibility is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 9, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance \nmisuse. The DCSA CAF explained in the SOR why it was unable to find it clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The \nDCSA CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \n(DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nGuidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017, applicable to all adjudications for national security \neligibility or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. \nOn June 17, 2021, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and indicated that he \nwanted a determination on the written record without a hearing. After some clarification, \nApplicant requested a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nadministrative judge. On September 16, 2021, the Government amended the SOR to \nallege Guideline J and Guideline E security concerns because of a March 2020 arrest and \nits disposition. Applicant responded to the amendment on October 7, 2021. \nOn October 27, 2021, the Government indicated it was ready to proceed to a \nhearing. On November 29, 2021, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. I received the case assignment and file on December 2, 2021. \nOn March 4, 2022, I informed Applicant that I was scheduling video conference \nhearings via Microsoft Teams. After some coordination of schedules with the parties, on \nMarch 9, 2022, I scheduled a hearing for April 26, 2022. \nAt the hearing, four Government exhibits (GE 1-4) were admitted into evidence \nwithout any objections, and Applicant testified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) \nreceived by DOHA on May 5, 2022. I held the record open after the hearing, initially \nthrough May 17, 2022, for Applicant to submit documents. \nShortly after the hearing concluded, Applicant submitted a court record, which was \naccepted into evidence as an Applicant exhibit (AE A) without any objection. A copy of his \ncollege degree, submitted on May 9, 2022, was admitted into evidence without any \nobjections as AE B. Between May 13, 2022, and May 17, 2022, Applicant submitted 27 \nstatements from character references, primarily but not exclusively co-workers. The \ndocuments were accepted into evidence without any objections as AE C through AE CC. \nOn May 18, 2022, Applicant submitted an additional character reference statement. \nThe Government had no objection to reopening the record or to its admissibility, and the \ndocument was accepted into the record as AE DD. \nFindings of Fact \nThe amended SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used with varying \nfrequency marijuana from approximately January 2007 to May 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); LSD from \napproximately January 2009 to December 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); cocaine from approximately \nJanuary 2010 to December 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and MDMA from approximately March 2010 \nto October 2010 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); that Applicant purchased marijuana from approximately \nJanuary 2007 to May 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and cocaine from approximately January 2010 to \napproximately January 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and that Applicant was charged with possession \nof marijuana in approximately November 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), September 2010 (SOR \u00b6 1.h), \nand January 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.i). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n   \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, under Guidelines J (SOR \u00b6 2) and E (SOR \u00b6 3), Applicant was allegedly \narrested in March 2020 and charged with assault and battery on a family or household \nmember, intimidation of a witness, and malicious destruction of property (SOR \u00b6 2.a, cross-\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a); and that he was on pretrial probation from March 21, 2021, until \nSeptember 29, 2021 (SOR \u00b6 2.b, cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a). \nIn response to the SOR allegations, Applicant admitted the drug use, drug purchase, \nand drug charges. He provided a detailed statement (Answer), explaining that he used the \ndrugs primarily while working in the restaurant industry and during his initial college \nexperience. He indicated that he took corrective actions to avoid recurrence of illegal drug \nuse, including returning to college, earning his degree, and commencing his career in \nengineering. Applicant also admitted that he was arrested and charged as alleged in March \n2020, and that he was placed on pre-trial probation until September 29, 2021, but he \ndenied that he had \u201claid hands\u201d on the complainant, then a cohabitant girlfriend. \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I find that the pretrial \nprobation was imposed for the March 2020 assault and does not represent an additional \nincident of criminal conduct under Guideline J or of personal conduct under Guideline E. \nAccordingly, the pretrial probation was considered in assessing the security significance of \nthe conduct in SOR \u00b6 2.a, and not as a separate basis for disqualification under either \nGuideline J or Guideline E. Additional findings of fact follow. \nApplicant is a 31-year-old engineer who started with his current employer, a defense \ncontractor, as a co-op student in May 2018. (GEs 1, 2.) He became a full-time employee \non earning his bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in May 2019. (AE B.) He was \napparently granted an interim security clearance, as he testified he has been able to \naccess classified information at work. (Tr. 24.) He had not previously held a DOD \nclearance as he worked outside the defense industry. (GEs 1, 2.) Applicant has never \nmarried and has no children. (GE 1; Tr. 25.) He and his current girlfriend began a \ncohabitant relationship on April 1, 2022. (Tr. 43.) \nApplicant began using marijuana in high school in January 2007. A multiple-sports \nathlete wanting to succeed, he did not use marijuana often. (Answer.) In November 2007, \nhe was stopped while driving for having a broken light. He had used marijuana \nrecreationally with friends, who had provided the marijuana. (GEs 1, 2.) Applicant was \ncharged with misdemeanor marijuana possession. A year later, the case was continued \nwithout a finding. (GE 1.) He was required to pay a fine in an amount not now recalled and \nto complete community service. (GE 2.) \nApplicant started college in September 2008. He used marijuana \u201cintermittently,\u201d \nknowing that it was illegal to use the drug. (GEs 1, 2; Tr. 27-28.) The summer following his \nfreshman year, he began working as a line cook at a restaurant. (GE 1.) He returned to \ncollege that fall.

His new roommates invited some people to their room \nwhom Applicant did not know, and one of them smoked marijuana. Someone called the \npolice, who smelled the marijuana. Although Applicant had not used marijuana on that \noccasion, he was held responsible because it was his room. He was cited for misdemeanor \npossession of marijuana and placed on probation. (GEs 1, 2.) He dropped out of the \nuniversity and began pursuing a career in the culinary arts. (Answer.) While working in the \nrestaurant industry, he took two classes a semester at the community college, and earned \nhis associate\u2019s degree in June 2015. (GE 1.) \nApplicant worked in a succession of restaurants, eventually advancing to the \nposition of sous chef. Due to longer shifts and weekend work required in the industry, it led \nto many late nights for Applicant, who began socializing with others with similar hours. \nIllegal drug use, especially of marijuana and cocaine, was widespread among his friends in \nthe industry, and he used both drugs with them. He used marijuana to relax, and was a \ndaily user of marijuana during his early to mid-20s.

He related that he had seen \nthe adverse impacts of drug use in the change of personality observed in some friends and \nthe loss of some friends due to overdose. (GE 2.) \nOn September 19, 2019, the investigator re-contacted Applicant to clarify the \ndiscrepancy on his SF 86 regarding the dates of his last use of cocaine (January 2018) and \nof last purchase of cocaine (January 2019). Applicant indicated that he last used and \npurchased cocaine in January 2018, and that any reference to January 2019 was a \nmistake. (GE 2.) \nIn February 2020, Applicant was given an opportunity by DOHA to review the report \nof his interview and correct any inaccuracies. After \u201cdouble checking dates,\u201d he realized \nthat he last used cocaine and LSD at a New Year\u2019s Eve party in \u201cDecember 2018 going \ninto January 2019\u201d when the drugs were offered to him. He made the \u201cbad decision to try \nit.\u201d He denied any subsequent use of either LSD or cocaine and indicated that he would not \nconsume either drug again. He gave dates of 2008 for his first uses of cannabis and LSD, \nand 2010 for MDMA, but that he was not sure of when he first used cocaine. He described \nthe frequency of his cannabis use as regular, and of cocaine, LSD, and MDMA as rare.

He \u201csaw [his] hard work was being acknowledged and [he] was moving \nforward in life.\u201d Applicant responded affirmatively to whether he associates with persons \nwho use illegal substances and stated, \u201cI have friends and family members that use \ncannabis.\u201d In answer to whether he had been in situations where illegal drugs were being \nused, Applicant stated: \u201cI have been offed [sic] cannabis, but I decline because of my job \nand strive to do better than I have done in the past.\u201d (GE 2.) \nAlso, in his February 2020 response to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories, Applicant admitted \nthat he had failed a urinalysis test for illegal drugs. He explained that, when initially required \nto go to counseling for the infraction in the adjacent state, he tested positive but then \n\u201cended up quitting and passing the remaining tests.\u201d The evidence indicates that the \ninfraction to which Applicant referred was his September 2010 marijuana possession. He \nindicated that he had not had any drug counseling or treatment. (GEs 1, 2.) \nApplicant has not used any illegal drugs since his last use of marijuana in May 2019. \nHe does not believe that he would be drawn to use the drug again in times of high stress or \ndifficult situations. (Tr. 31.) He testified that he associates with different people, and it is not \nworth risking how far he has come. He is aware that his employer has a drug-use policy in \nthat illegal drug use is not allowed by employees. (Tr. 32.) He later testified that his siblings \nuse marijuana.

When asked for the date when he was last offered marijuana, Applicant responded \nthat he could not remember, but it was while working for his current employer, although he \nreported that he declined the offer. (Tr. 41-42.) He admitted that he still sees, \u201cevery now \nand then,\u201d a few of his friends who use marijuana, while asserting that \u201cmany\u201d have \nstopped using the drug. (Tr. 42.) Applicant is subject to random drug testing at work, \nalthough he has not been called for a drug test. (Tr. 46-47.) \nOn March 13, 2020, Applicant had an altercation with his then-cohabitant girlfriend. \nShe complained to the police that he came home intoxicated, and she locked their \napartment door on him because he had been drinking. He gained entry by damaging the \ndoor knob. When she told him she was going to call the police, he threw a plastic statue \nagainst the wall and struck her hand causing her to drop her cell phone. She further \ncomplained that he ripped a black bag of hers in half, but she also stated that he did not \nthrow any objects at her or in her direction, and she was not injured. Applicant admitted to \nthe police that he had been out drinking, had broken the door, and had argued with his \ngirlfriend, but he denied any other type of altercation. Applicant\u2019s then girlfriend exhibited \nno signs of injury, and she declined an emergency protective order. Applicant was arrested \nfor assault and battery on a family or household member for hitting his then-girlfriend\u2019s \nhand; intimidation of witness for attempting to prevent her from calling the police; and \nmalicious destruction of property for damaging the apartment door. (GE 3.) Applicant \nasserts that his relationship with his then girlfriend was coming to an end at that point. \nHowever, he denies that he laid a hand on her or even touched her that night. (Tr. 20, 34.) \nHe asserts that he had consumed only one beer, but his ex-girlfriend did not want him to go \nout that night so she locked him out of their apartment; that the door that was reportedly \ndamaged was held by a chain lock, and it opened when he leaned on it. (Tr. 33, 36.) He \nadmits that he threw something against the wall and tore a black bag that belonged to his \nthen cohabitant, but denies that he slapped her phone from her hand. (Tr. 34.) \nAfter the incident, Applicant immediately moved from the apartment and ended the \nrelationship. (Tr. 38.) At his arraignment on July 15, 2020, he was ordered to not abuse the \nvictim. On March 29, 2021, he was placed on pretrial probation to September 29, 2021, \nand ordered to pay $120 in restitution for the destruction of property. (GE 4; AE A.) On \nSeptember 29, 2021, the charges were dismissed at the recommendation of the probation \ndepartment.

This senior engineer, who has spent \nmost of his career in the defense industry, indicates that they knew it might be difficult for \nApplicant to obtain a security clearance because of his association and cohabitation with a \nforeign national at the time. Nevertheless, the company believed Applicant could be a \nreliable and conscientious engineer for them, which Applicant has proven to be. This \nengineer is aware of the incident between Applicant and his former partner, and he has \nseen no indication of any conduct by Applicant that would substantiate the allegations \nagainst him by his ex-girlfriend. The engineer is also aware that Applicant made some poor \ndecisions in the past in that he got mixed up with the wrong group of friends and \n\u201cexperimented\u201d with illegal drugs. The engineer reports that he has had some \u201cserious \ndiscussions\u201d with Applicant about those decisions and their effects on his present life and \nhis future aspirations.

Applicant has shown himself to be very \nresponsible and a \u201cstraight shooter\u201d on the job. The co-worker has high hopes for Applicant \nas an engineer.

When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \n9 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that, effective January 2, 2009, the state \nwhere Applicant lives and works decriminalized the personal use and possession of one \nounce or less of marijuana. Possession of one ounce or less of marijuana became a civil \noffense, subjecting an offender 18 years of age or older to a civil penalty of $100 and \nforfeiture of the marijuana. On December 15, 2016, the state legalized the use, purchase, \npossession or manufacture of one ounce or less of marijuana by adults age 21 years or \nolder. However, possession of LSD, MDMA, and cocaine remained illegal. \nMoreover, marijuana, LSD, and MDMA are Schedule I controlled substances under \nfederal law pursuant to Title 21, Section 812 of the United States Code. Schedule I drugs \nare those which have a high potential for abuse; have no currently accepted medical use in \ntreatment in the United States; and lack accepted safety for use of the drug under medical \nsupervision. Cocaine, as a Schedule II drug has an accepted medical use, but it has a high \npotential for abuse and may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence. It is \nillegal to possess cocaine when it is not medically authorized. Section 844 under Title 21 of \nthe United States Code makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly or intentionally \npossess a controlled substance not obtained pursuant to a valid prescription. \nOn October 25, 2014, the then Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued \nguidance that changes to laws by some states and the District of Columbia to legalize or \ndecriminalize the recreational use of marijuana do not alter existing federal law or the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines, and that an individual\u2019s disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. \nMoreover, on December 21, 2021, the current DNI issued clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana, noting that prior recreational use of marijuana by an individual may \nbe relevant to security adjudications, but is not determinative in the whole-person \nevaluation. Relevant factors in mitigation include the frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur. The DNI also made clear \nthat products that contain more than 0.3 percent of THC remain illegal to use under federal \nlaw and policy. \nApplicant used marijuana intermittently in high school and socially while in college. \nDuring his early-to-mid 20s, he used marijuana daily. He persisted in using and purchasing \nmarijuana despite three arrests for illegal possession; completing a drug diversion program \nfor the September 2010 offense; and returning to college for his bachelor\u2019s degree in \nengineering. He used and purchased marijuana while working as a co-op student for his \ncurrent employer from May 2018 to May 2019. He was introduced to cocaine and LSD \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nduring the 2009-2010 timeframe at the first college he attended. His use of LSD did not go \nbeyond experimentation, but after reportedly disliking the drug\u2019s effects, he tried it again at \na New Year\u2019s Eve party in December 2018. He used cocaine with varying frequency, and \npurchased it from friends, primarily while working in the restaurant industry, but he also \nused cocaine at that party in December 2018 because of peer pressure in that others were \nusing it. Guideline H disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse,\u201d and \n25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d apply. \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s failed drug test following his September 2010 marijuana possession \noffense, it cannot be considered for disqualification purposes because it was not alleged. \nAccordingly, AG \u00b6 25(b), \u201ctesting positive for an illegal drug,\u201d does not apply. \nApplicant bears the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply of his \nillegal drug activity. AG \u00b6 26 provides for mitigation as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non an individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \nillegal drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging \nthat any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during \nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, \nbut not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without \nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies in mitigation, but only of Applicant\u2019s involvement with MDMA, \nwhich was infrequent and occurred over a decade ago. Applicant\u2019s use of LSD may well \nhave been \u201crare,\u201d and his use of cocaine primarily occurred while he was working in the \nrestaurant industry. However, his use of LSD and cocaine at the party in late December \n2018 was relatively recent as of his June 2019 SF 86 and occurred while he was a co-op \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstudent for his current employer. While this drug involvement preceded the offer of full-time \nemployment to him, it does not justify or minimize the seriousness of his illegal drug use. \nRegarding AG \u00b6 26(b), Applicant provided discrepant dates for his last use of \ncocaine. He indicated on his SF 86 that he last used cocaine in January 2018 but \npurchased it in January 2019, and confirmed those dates during his OPM interview. When \ncontacted in September 2019 about the discrepancy, he stated that any reference to \nJanuary 2019 was a mistake. He gave a January 2018 date for his last use of LSD. In \nFebruary 2020, he indicated that he realized after checking dates that he last used LSD \nand cocaine in December 2018, so almost a year later than previously reported. It is \ndifficult to believe that he failed to recall in June 2019 that he had used the drugs only six \nmonths prior, but he is credited with correcting the record in February 2020. His candid \nadmissions of illegal drug use and purchase, including of marijuana to within weeks of \ncompleting his SF 86, allow me to accept as credible his claims of abstinence from MDNA \nsince 2010; LSD and cocaine since late December 2018; and marijuana since May 2019. \nAs to whether Applicant has established a sufficient pattern of abstinence for \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 26(b), I have to consider other factors, such as the frequency and \ncircumstances of drug use and whether Applicant\u2019s activities, associations, or environment \npresent a risk of relapse. Applicant would certainly have had a stronger case in mitigation \nhad he ceased using illegal drugs once he left the restaurant industry and decided to return \nto college. Even so, I am persuaded that he is not likely to use cocaine, MDMA, or LSD in \nthe future. He used those drugs in social settings that are not likely to reoccur. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use is contrasted with his use of other illegal substances by its \nregularity and duration. He used the drug for over a decade, not only socially but to relax. \nThe drug was a normal part of his life. Some five years ago, he made a life-altering \ndecision to return to school, but that decision did not include a commitment to a drug-free \nlifestyle. He continued to use marijuana because he enjoyed it. While he indicated during \nhis August 2019 interview that he was no longer socializing or associating with individuals \nwho use drugs illegally, he candidly disclosed in response to DOHA interrogatories in \nFebruary 2020 that he has friends and family members who use cannabis, and that he has \nbeen offered cannabis since he stopped using, although he declined to use it. At his \nhearing, he admitted that he still sees a few of his friends who use marijuana and that his \nsiblings use marijuana. With regard to his siblings, who live out of state, they used \nmarijuana around him at a family gathering. He asserts that he has told them he no longer \nuses the drug because of his job, \u201cso they kind of keep it to themselves.\u201d Applicant\u2019s \ncohabitant girlfriend does not use illegal drugs, so his day-to-day environment is not \nconducive to illegal drug use. \nApplicant asserts that he did not realize the negative ramifications of his continued \nuse of marijuana until he applied for a security clearance. His job is clearly important to him \nand is regarded as a significant deterrent to future drug use. He is subject to random drug \ntesting on the job, although he has not been called. At the same time, it is concerning that \nthe illegality of his drug use played no part in his decisions to use or stop using drugs. \nWhile those of his character references who are aware of his drug-using past believe he \n12 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwill not do anything to jeopardize his career and future, Applicant used LSD and cocaine at \na party, knowing that it was inconsistent with the goals he had in life. It is more likely that \nhe would use marijuana, a drug that he enjoyed and used regularly, if faced with a similar \nsituation, especially if alcohol was also involved. Applicant has found himself in situations \nwhere marijuana was being used, although he did not elaborate about the circumstances \nor frequency. At this juncture, the drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns are not fully mitigated. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concerns about criminal conduct are set forth in AG \u00b6 30, which \nprovides: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nApplicant was on pre-trial probation from March 2021 to September 2021 because \nof March 2020 charges of intimidation, domestic assault and battery, and malicious \ndestruction of property against a then cohabitant girlfriend. He denies that he struck or hit \nher but admits that he argued with her, threw an item against the wall, and damaged both \nthe door lock and a bag of hers during a verbal altercation. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 \n31(b) is established by the conduct of concern, not by the disposition, which is the legal \nconsequence of the criminal conduct. AG \u00b6 31(b) provides: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, \nand matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nindividual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nTwo of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are established in whole or in part. \nThey are: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \nThe incident involving Applicant\u2019s ex-girlfriend occurred after his case had been \nreferred to DOHA because of his illegal drug use. He was placed on pre-trial probation \nafter the SOR was issued. It cannot reasonably be concluded that \u201cso much time has \nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened\u201d to conclude that it does not cast doubt on \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s judgment. Yet, given Applicant immediately terminated his relationship with his \nex-girlfriend, and it was isolated in nature, it is not likely to recur. Moreover, Applicant has \nshown evidence of successful rehabilitation in that he completed the pre-trial probation\nsuccessfully, and has a good employment record. The criminal conduct security concerns \nare mitigated. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonest, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative of \nadjudicative processes. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe personal conduct security concerns are set forth in AG \u00b6 15, which provides: \nThe assault, intimidation, and malicious destruction charges and disposition were \ncross-alleged under Guideline E. AG \u00b6 16(c) applies when the credible adverse information \nis not alone enough to warrant denial of security clearance eligibility but raises security \nconcerns when considering other issues of security concern, as follows: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nApplicant showed poor judgment in damaging the lock to gain entry to their \napartment, arguing with his ex-girlfriend, throwing items, and tearing her bag in March \n2020. However, his ex-girlfriend was not injured, and it appears to have an isolated \nincident. The following two mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 apply in whole or in part: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s actions escalated the incident to where his ex-girlfriend felt threatened \nenough to call the police. However, the personal conduct security concerns raised by the \nMarch 2020 incident have been mitigated by the ending of the personal relationship with \nthe victim and no recurrence of such inappropriate behavior. The personal conduct security \nconcerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe Government must be assured that those persons granted access to classified \ninformation can be counted on to fulfill their responsibilities consistent with laws, \nregulations, and policies, including federal drug laws and security clearance requirements. \nApplicant\u2019s drug use was not confined to his first college experience or to his socialization \nwith co-workers and friends while working in the restaurant industry. His drug use cannot \nbe excused as youthful indiscretion. \nApplicant\u2019s dedication to his engineering studies is reflected in him earning his \nbachelor\u2019s degree with honors, even while continuing to use marijuana. His contributions to \nhis employer are unassailable. The many co-workers who provided character statements \nattested to the professionalism with which he treats his duties. He takes his job seriously; \nhas an \u201cexceptional work ethic;\u201d appreciates assistance and is willing to help others; follows \nhis employer\u2019s quality, safety, and security protocols; and understands and complies with \nthe rules and regulations regarding the handling and safeguarding of classified information. \nHe appears to be committed to his career and to a future without illegal drugs. \nYet, it is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security\nclearance.

Sykstus, Esq. \n09/15/2022 \nDecision \nMURPHY, Braden M., Administrative Judge: \nOn two occasions in 2017, Applicant took a prescription Tylenol pill that she had \nbeen given by a friend. She did not disclose this conduct on security clearance \napplications and interviews. I conclude that her lack of disclosure was not deliberate \nbecause it was based on her sincere and reasonable belief that her conduct did not \nconstitute \u201cmisuse\u201d of the prescription pill in question, and, thus, was not reportable. \nPersonal conduct allegations of deliberate falsification and deliberate intention to \nmislead the government are not established. I regard Applicant as a credible, sincere \nwitness. She also presented strong whole-person evidence of her work ethic, judgment, \ntrustworthiness and reliability. Personal conduct security concerns are resolved in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted security clearance applications (SCAs) on December 11, \n2017 and March 7, 2019. On May 21, 2020, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant alleging security concerns under Guideline E \n(personal conduct).

The \ncase was initially assigned to another DOHA administrative judge on October 25, 2021. \nDOHA issued a notice scheduling the hearing for May 20, 2022, to occur in person at a \ngeographic location near where Applicant lives and works.

GE 1 through 3 were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant\u2019s counsel objected to admission of GE 4, which is a report prepared \nby another government agency (AGA) regarding a polygraph and related interview of \nApplicant, including a statement by Applicant. Counsel\u2019s objection was sustained in part \nand overruled in part, and GE 4 was only partially admitted. (Tr. 16-29) Applicant \nsubmitted Exhibits (AE) A through D, all of which were admitted without objection. \nApplicant, her husband, and two other witnesses testified.

After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 33 years old. She and her husband met in college, married soon \nthereafter, and have been married for 11 years. They have two young children. (Tr. 31\u00ad\n32; GE 2) Applicant attended college on a full scholarship and graduated with a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2011.

(Tr. \n45-47, 60-62; Answer) (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s second stint in college, she had a scholarship under which \nshe was required to intern for a state, local, or federal government agency. Her \nuniversity is in a rural area of her home state, so opportunities for such internships were \nrare, and she was married with a young child, so traveling long distance for the \ninternship was not a viable option. Through a campus job fair, she learned of the \nopportunity to intern for an AGA. She was required to submit an SCA and sit for a \npolygraph interview, in December 2017. (Tr. 41-43, 48; GE 2, GE 4) This was the first \nSCA Applicant had prepared. (Tr. 87-88) \nApplicant\u2019s December 11, 2017 SCA included the following question: \nMisuse of Prescription Drugs: In the last seven (7) years, have you\nintentionally engaged in the misuse of prescription drugs, regardless of\nwhether or not the drugs were prescribed for you or for someone else? \n \n \nThe word \u201cmisuse\u201d is not otherwise defined in the SCA. Applicant answered \u201cNo,\u201d and \nthereby did not disclose her use of her friend\u2019s prescription Tylenol in August and \nDecember 2017. (GE 2 at 32) (SOR \u00b6 1.e) \nApplicant participated in a polygraph interview ten days later. The questions she \nwas asked in the polygraph are redacted in GE 4, as are the technical results. GE 4 \ncontains a statement from Applicant, which she signed after the polygraph, in answer to \nmore specific questions from the polygrapher. In the statement, Applicant \nacknowledged: \nI have withheld information about reckless behavior about [sic] texting \nwhile driving. I minimized the number of times I have texted while \ndriving\u2026\u201d \nI have driven while intoxicated while in college in the years 2008-2010. \nThis happened less than five times total over the span of those years. \nI said I did not use a prescription drug for which I did not have a \nprescription in my PSI [Personal Subject Interview]. I have used a friend\u2019s \nprescription Tylenol to help with a hangover on two different occasions, \nonce in August and once in the beginning of December of 2017. I took one \npill on each occasion. (GE 4 at 5) \nApplicant\u2019s statement in Government Exhibit 4 is the basis for SOR \u00b6 1.b, which \nalleges that she made false statements in her polygraph interview in concealing her \n2017 misuse of prescription drugs, texting while driving, and driving while intoxicated. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \nApplicant testified that among the questions she was asked during the polygraph \ninterview was \u201cHave you ever done something that would be considered illegal?\u201d She \ndid not initially consider texting while driving to be something for which she could be \narrested. (Tr. 49-51, 86-87) She said that she acknowledged that she had probably \ndriven under the influence of alcohol on a few occasions during her first stint in college, \nbut had never been arrested, charged, or ticketed. (Answer; Tr. 55-56) \nApplicant said that the polygrapher asked her in the post-polygraph interview \nwhether she had ever illegally used drugs. She said no. He asked her if she had ever \nused a prescription drug or taken medicine that was not hers. She then disclosed that \nshe had used a neighbor\u2019s prescription drug, as noted. (Tr. 54-55) \nApplicant said the polygrapher told her that using a friend\u2019s prescription drug \nwould not have been \u201cbad enough\u201d to have made her \u201cfail\u201d a question on the polygraph. \n(Tr. 55, 59, 92) She said she was never told by the polygrapher that what she did \nqualified as \u201cmisuse\u201d of a prescription drug, requiring disclosure. (Tr. 59) She testified \nthat the polygrapher told her that, in preparing her post-interview statement, to \n\u201coverestimate\u201d the number of times she might have done these things, in case it came \nup in the future. (Tr. 55-58) \nApplicant acknowledged that she found the experience of taking the polygraph \nexam intimidating and she was nervous. She described the experience and its \naftermath as \u201cextremely traumatic\u201d and upsetting. (Tr. 70, 85) \nApplicant submitted a second SCA in March 2019, in connection with her current \nposition. (GE 1) This SCA asked the same question about \u201cMisuse of Prescription \nDrugs\u201d as on GE 2, quoted above. As before, Applicant answered \u201cNo.\u201d (GE 1 at 34) \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nApplicant denied intentionally attempting to conceal the truth about her use of the \nsomeone else\u2019s prescription drug. (Tr. 60, 64-65, 85) She said she had not seen a copy \nof the polygraph report before submitting her second SCA. (Tr. 71) She also said she \nrelied on the explanation from the polygrapher in not subsequently disclosing her use of \nthe prescription drug on the 2019 SCA. (Tr. 92-93) Applicant said she \u201cread through \nevery question again\u201d in preparing GE 1. (Tr. 94) \nApplicant testified that she read the question (on both SCAs) as requiring \ndisclosure of prescription drugs that she was hiding, or was addicted to or overusing. \n(Tr. 59, 64-65) She did not believe what she did was \u201cintentional misuse of prescription \ndrugs.\u201d (Answer) She said, \u201cI didn\u2019t see this as misuse.\u201d (Tr. 45, 84) The term \u201cmisuse\u201d \nto her meant addiction or overuse, even of one\u2019s own prescription. (Tr. 75, 89-91) For \ninstance, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard of my husband\u2019s [football] teammates that are actually \naddicted to pain meds. That is the image that [I] conjured up in my head. It never \ncrossed my mind.\u201d (Tr. 75) (Applicant\u2019s husband played college football, was drafted by \na professional franchise, and had a brief pro football career.) (Tr. 35-37) With that \nbackground, Applicant did not see taking two pills of someone else\u2019s prescription \nTylenol as a reportable misuse. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant said she was also an athlete in college and was subject to drug testing, \nso she has long been aware of the need to avoid using drugs illegally. (Tr. 34, 54) She \nhas never used any illegal drugs. (Tr. 45) \nApplicant also did not disclose on her 2019 SCA that she had a prior background \ninvestigation. (GE 1 at 35) (This was not alleged in the SOR). When asked why she did \nnot, she said that when she was told that when she did not get the internship with the \nAGA, that the background investigation had ceased. She therefore believed that, a \nbackground investigation \u201cnever really took place.\u201d (Tr. 71-72) In her view, \u201cI had no \nkind of idea as to whether or not it was ever formally investigated, and so I looked at \nthose questions. And I was like, well. I cannot say yes because I don\u2019t know. . . And so I \nkept it as no.\u201d (Tr. 95) Applicant made a similar statement in her interrogatory response \nto DOHA, in which she authenticated and adopted her 2019 interview summary, with \ncorrections. (GE 3) She wrote, \u201cI do not know if a formal background investigation was \ninitiated.\u201d (GE 3 at 10) \nThe summary of Applicant\u2019s August 2019 background interview, following her \nsecond SCA, indicates that she was asked if: 1) she had used illegal drugs or misused \nprescription drugs; 2) her use of alcohol has had a negative impact on her life; 3) she \nhad ever been involved in criminal activity; or 4) she had intentionally withheld any \ninformation or intentionally provided false or misleading information. The interview \nsummary reflects that \u201cSubject provided a NO answer to each question.\u201d (GE 3 at 3) \nApplicant was then confronted with evidence of the polygraph examination and its \ndetails. (GE 3 at 3-4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant falsified material facts to the investigator in \nfailing to acknowledge her misuse of prescription drugs. In answering SOR \u00b6 1.d, \nApplicant denied any intent to falsify. She testified: \nAt this point I still 100 percent believed that I did not intentionally engage \nin the misuse of prescription drugs. The words that stand out to me [are] \n\u2018intentionally\u2019 and \u2018misuse.\u2019 I, what came to . . . my mind is not at all what I \ndid. No one at any point has said you should have . . . worded that \ndifferently. That counts as that. Why didn\u2019t you realize that? I read the \nquestion and I said, No. I did not believe that I intentionally engaged in the \nmisuse. I took one at two different points in time, and it did not qualify to \nme as something that would be an issue at all. (Tr. 62-63) \nApplicant said that this was, in part, because of what the polygrapher had told her. (Tr. \n63) She explained in her background interview that she did not believe she misused the \nprescription because she followed the instructions on the label, even though it was not \nher prescription. (GE 6 at 4) She said in her Answer that she read the label to make \nsure the bottle contained Tylenol and not something else. (Answer) \nAs Applicant explained in her answer, until her August 2019 background \ninterview, she did not believe that she had intentionally misused prescription pills. \u201cAfter \ngoing through this process, it has become clear that, no matter the intention, any use of \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprescription drugs not prescribed to you is still considered intentionally misusing \nprescription pills.\u201d (Answer to SOR \u00b6 1.d) \nApplicant closed her direct testimony by emphasizing that she did not intend to \nlie or deceive. It goes against her nature and her upbringing. She was raised in a \nreligious household, and as a mother she strives to teach the value of honesty to her \nyoung children. She has worked hard to get where she is and to go back to school with \na young child was \u201cthe hardest thing I have ever done.\u201d In retrospect she wishes she \nhad just taken over-the-counter Tylenol. She did not think that what she did, qualified as \nmisuse. (Tr. 66) \nOn one occasion in her current job, Applicant took a book home from work, \nwithout realizing that inside the book, there was a disk and the disk was labeled \n\u201csecret.\u201d When she discovered the disk, she called her security officers promptly, \nreported the matter, and returned the disk. She later learned that the disk had been \nmislabeled by another employee, and did not contain classified information. No \ndisciplinary action was taken against her. (Tr. 77-78; GE 3 at 6) \nApplicant\u2019s husband attested that she is very truthful, and is \u201chonest to a fault.\u201d \nShe carries herself with integrity and is a good mother to their children. Applicant is \nproud of her work and seeks to set an example for their children. He confirmed that he \nsaw some of his teammates overuse prescription drugs on occasion. (Tr. 100-112) \nApplicant\u2019s character witness, Mr. S, retired from federal employment in 2009. In \nsubsequent years, he worked for various contractors, as well as for the university that \nemploys Applicant. He has held a clearance for many years. He hired Applicant after \nshe graduated, and was her supervisor for several years. They worked together on a \ndaily basis. He has also known her family for many years. He regards her work as \noutstanding. She is also highly ethical and conscientious about protecting classified \ninformation. He is aware of the allegations against Applicant alleging her untruthfulness. \nThe allegations do not \u201cmatch the person I knew and had been working with.\u201d He has no \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Mr. S also shared that he is \na certified trainer in something called a \u201cJudgment Index,\u201d a test intended to measure \nthe test-taker\u2019s capacity for decision-making and judgment. He said Applicant scored \nvery well on the test. (Tr. 113-122) (The test itself is not in evidence, either generally or \nabout Applicant in particular). \nMr. M formerly worked as a contractor at Applicant\u2019s work site, and he was a \nsupervisor of Applicant\u2019s from 2019 to 2021. They had daily contact. He felt she did \nexcellent work, including in a role as a project lead. He is also a retired Navy senior \nchief petty officer (E-8), and he has held a security clearance for many years. He is \naware of the government\u2019s security concerns in the case. He would believe Applicant if \nshe said she was not lying. He has no concerns about her having access to classified \ninformation.

(AE B-AE D) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, . . . determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information or omitting \ninformation, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, [or] \nsecurity official, . . . in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; and  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information.  \nOn two occasions in late 2017, Applicant took prescription Tylenol that had not \nbeen prescribed to her, but to the friend who gave it to her. Though she did not \nrecognize it at the time, she later came to realize that taking someone else\u2019s \nprescription drug, regardless of the type of medication or purpose for which it is used, \nconstitutes misuse of a prescription drug, even if it is a dated, isolated instance, does \nnot constitute \u201coveruse,\u201d or lead to addiction. SOR \u00b6 1.a, which Applicant admitted, \nalleges her conduct as a security concern. It was alleged under Guideline E for personal \nconduct, and not elsewhere, such as under Guideline H (drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse) or Guideline J (criminal conduct). AG \u00b6 15(c) therefore applies to \nSOR \u00b6 1.a.  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose her two-time \u201cmisuse\u201d of a prescription Tylenol pill on \ntwo SCAs and in two subsequent interviews. The remaining allegations concern \nwhether or not she engaged in deliberate falsification or attempts to mislead. In each \ninstance, Applicant denied the allegations of intentional falsification. This puts the \nburden on the Government to show, in each instance alleged, that she was acting with \ndeliberate intent. \nIn each instance, Applicant steadfastly answered and explained that she did not \nbelieve what she did constituted \u201cmisuse\u201d of a prescription drug, since she took a single \npill of common medication (Tylenol) on two isolated occasions. She did not believe her \nactions were reportable since they were not \u201coveruse\u201d or addictive behavior. In part, her \nview was colored by her experience as a former college athlete and as the wife of a \ncollege and professional football player, someone who had seen his teammates \noveruse prescription pills and painkillers. I found Applicant\u2019s interpretation credible and \nplausible, given her life experience and inexperience with security clearance \ninvestigation processes. She also explained that her later responses were impacted by \nwhat she said was the polygrapher\u2019s explanation that taking someone else\u2019s \nprescription pill was not \u201cbad enough\u201d to lead to a failed question on the polygraph (and \nthus, by extension, did not constitute a security concern).  \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose her 2017 misuse \nof prescription drugs on her December 2017 SCA. Applicant did not believe that what \nshe did constituted misuse of prescription drugs. She did not intend to falsify her answer \nto the relevant question on GE 2 in 2017. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not established. SOR \u00b6 1.e is \nfound for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b concerns alleged falsifications during the polygraph interview in \nDecember 2017. The specific questions Applicant was asked are redacted from GE 4, \nas are the technical results. Under Appeal Board precedent, I am not permitted to \nconsider the results of a polygraph report. See ISCR Case No. 15-07539 at 5, n. 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 18, 2018) (\u201cThe actual polygraph results are not disclosed in the record, and, in \nany event, are not proper matters for our consideration. Statements made in response \nto questioning during a polygraph examination are admissible, although the results of \nthe exam itself are not.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-31428 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, \n2006)). \nI therefore have considered Applicant\u2019s post-polygraph statement in weighing her \nintent. I conclude that she did not intend to provide deliberately false or misleading \ninformation. She believed that what she did was not \u201cmisuse\u201d of a prescription drug. \nThis belief was sincere, reasonable, and plausible. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b also alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose certain \ninstances of texting while driving and possible driving while intoxicated or driving under \nthe influence of alcohol, years before while in college. The questions asked by the \npolygrapher are not in the record, so it is difficult to establish Applicant\u2019s intent. In \naddition, I am unable to determine the criminality of such conduct without further \nevidence. I conclude that deliberate falsification and intention to mislead is also not \nestablished. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not established. SOR \u00b6 1.b is found for Applicant. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose her 2017 misuse \nof prescription drugs on her March 2019 SCA. The wording of the question on GE 2 is \nidentical to the wording on GE 1. Applicant prepared this SCA after her polygraph \ninterview, and she said she read over each question again before answering it on the \nsecond SCA. However, Applicant did not believe that what she did constituted misuse of \nprescription drugs, so she believed it was not reportable. She did not intend to falsify \nher answer to the relevant question on GE 2 in 2017. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not established. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is found for Applicant. \nThe summary of Applicant\u2019s August 2019 background interview, following her \nsecond SCA, indicates that she was asked if she had used illegal drugs or misused \nprescription drugs. Applicant believed that she had not misused prescription drugs. She \ntherefore did not intend to provide false or misleading information to the investigator by \nnot disclosing her use of someone else\u2019s prescription Tylenol.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant falsified material facts to the investigator in \nfailing to acknowledge her misuse of prescription drugs. Applicant denied the allegation, \nstating again that she did not think what she did constituted misuse, so she did not \nintentionally make a false or misleading statement to the investigator. I therefore \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s explanation is reasonable and plausible, and that she did not \ndeliberately falsify or intend to mislead the investigator in not disclosing the prescription \nuse. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not established. SOR \u00b6 1.d is found for Applicant. \nThe Government did not allege that Applicant deliberately lied or made a \nmisleading statement to the investigator in failing to disclose a prior investigation. That \ncannot be considered disqualifying conduct. Further, Applicant\u2019s explanation for her \nbelief, while incorrect, is also a reasonable and plausible explanation, particularly since \nwhatever investigation the AGA might have undertaken, ended after the polygraph.  \nSince I conclude that Applicant did not deliberately intend to falsify her answers \neither on her SCAs or in the subsequent interviews with respect to the issue of misusing \na prescription drug, no disqualifying conditions apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.e. \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline \nE. Of those, only one is potentially applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.a: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s two instances of taking someone else\u2019s prescription Tylenol in 2017 \nare mitigated as minor, dated and isolated incidents that have not been repeated, and \ndoes not reflect poorly on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has an excellent academic and professional track record. She has an \nexcellent work ethic, is well-regarded at work, and is highly recommended by her \ncolleagues and supervisors, who attest to her leadership skills, and her judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. \nDuring Applicant\u2019s hearing and testimony, I had the opportunity to observe her \ndemeanor and assess her credibility, which plays a large part on my decision. I do not \nbelieve she intended to deceive or mislead the government. She made a mistake in \ntaking someone else\u2019s prescription Tylenol but did not believe that doing so constituted \n\u201cmisuse\u201d of the prescription. Her explanation was sincere, plausible, and credible. \nMoreover, I credit Applicant testimony about the disk that was labeled \u201csecret.\u201d She \nrecognized that he had a duty to report the matter to proper authorities, and she did so \npromptly and correctly. \nI conclude that Applicant provided sufficient credible evidence to resolve \npersonal conduct security concerns. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 1: Guideline E:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is clearly consistent \nwith the national security interests of the United States to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

(Tr. 12-14; GE 1) She briefly held an interim secret security \nclearance that was withdrawn as a result of these proceedings. She seeks a clearance \nwhich is a requirement of her continued employment. (Tr. 14, 30-31; GE 1) \nApplicant received her high school diploma in June 1994. She was awarded an \nassociate of arts degree in June 2008. (Tr. 14-15; GE 1; AE K) She was married from \nAugust 2000 to January 2007. That marriage ended by divorce. She has one adult son, \nwho resides with her and for whom she provides support. At the time of her hearing, she \nwas engaged to be married. (Tr. 15-16; GE 1) \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant reported drug use on her June 21, 2019 SF-86 when applying for a \nsecurity clearance with her current defense contractor. (GE 1) She was subsequently \ninterviewed on August 19, 2019, by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninvestigator regarding her drug use. (GE 2) She elaborated on her drug use in her \nApril 13, 2020 SOR Answer as well as during her testimony. The following summarizes \nthat drug use. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from \nabout June 1997 to about July 2019. She admitted this allegation. (SOR Answer) \nApplicant testified that she would have to guess regarding her frequency of marijuana \nuse during that timeframe. She stated that there were \u201clarge periods of time\u201d when she \ndid not use marijuana. In a post-hearing statement, Applicant indicated that she used \nmarijuana in 1997, 1998, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2011, 2012, 2016, and 2019. (Tr. 17-19; AE \nJ) \nApplicant first used marijuana after high school, \u201c[m]aybe around [age] 21 or so.\u201d \n(Tr. 28) She was unable to state with certainty the exact number of times she used \nmarijuana over the years, but was able to say that she did not use it on a regular basis. \nShe has been diagnosed with acute anxiety, and on the infrequent times she used \nmarijuana, it was at home. She did not purchase marijuana, but rather friends or family \nwould offer it to her. As noted above, there were gaps of time when she did not use \nmarijuana for years at a time.

Applicant \nadmitted this allegation, stating that \u201cthis was one of the biggest mistakes I have made \nin my life.\u201d (SOR Answer) She was on vacation with her father waiting for a flight at a \nCanadian airport in a designated marijuana and vaping area. She submitted a \nphotograph of the airport sign verifying this. (SOR Answer; Tr. 33) Her father offered her \nsome of his marijuana cigarette to calm her nerves and help her sleep during their flight. \nApplicant was convinced that her marijuana use was not illegal at the time given the fact \nthat it was legal in Canada and there were other individuals smoking marijuana. She \nunderstands now that her assumption was incorrect. She apologized for her actions and \nstated that she has not used marijuana since that occasion and would not use \nmarijuana in the future. (SOR Answer; Tr. 18-20, 33, 35-36) \nApplicant added that had she known marijuana use was \u201cillegal in the eyes of the \nDepartment of Defense,\u201d she would not have used it. (Tr. 20) Applicant\u2019s father \nsubmitted a signed, sworn, statement in which he stated that he is a combat-decorated \nU.S. Marine Corps veteran with a 100% Veterans Affairs (VA) disability due to severe \ninjuries received in Vietnam. He uses marijuana to alleviate pain and discomfort and he \n\u201cwill never use marijuana in her (Applicant\u2019s) presence in the future no matter where we \nare located.\u201d (AE H; Tr. 37-38) Applicant has discussed her father\u2019s use of marijuana \nwith him and has made it \u201cvery clear\u201d that he will not be able to self-medicate in her \npresence. Applicant\u2019s father does not live nearby and she is not able to see him as often \nas she would like. She did not see him at all during 2020, and has only seen him twice \nin 2021, due to the COVID pandemic. (Tr. 36-37) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleged that Applicant intended to use marijuana in the future. \nApplicant denied this allegation. (SOR Answer) Applicant stated that is contrary to what \nshe told the investigator during her OPM interview. She clarified what she told the \ninvestigator, which was, \u201cif it was legal, I would use marijuana in the future.\u201d She added, \n\u201cI understand that marijuana is not legal, and I have not used it since July 7, 2019. \nMarijuana is legal in [her state of residence] and many other states. This however is no \nexcuse as it is Federally illegal.\u201d She further emphasized that she has no intent to use \nmarijuana in the future. (SOR Answer; Tr. 20-21) \nApplicant understands that if she holds a security clearance, she is held to a \nhigher level of scrutiny than the average worker at her office. She also now understands \nthat if she is visiting a country where marijuana use is legal, she is still prohibited using \nit under any circumstances. Applicant committed to avoid circumstances where \nmarijuana was present. (Tr. 31-33) \nApplicant submitted a signed, sworn statement of intent, dated June 18, 2021, to \navoid any future drug use or other illegal use of drugs both presently and in the future, \nwith the understanding that any drug violation will result in the automatic revocation of \nclearance. (Tr. 25-26; AE G) Post-hearing, Applicant submitted a negative drug test \ndated July 15, 2021. (AE I) She does not associate with anyone, apart from her father, \nwho uses marijuana.

The collective sense of these references is that \nApplicant is an enthusiastic, trustworthy, and competent individual, who contributes to \nthe mission and assigned tasks.

They document a work \nrecord in which Applicant has performed well in her professional capacity and \ncontributes to the national defense. She is technically competent, well liked, trusted, and \nis respected by her peers and management.

(Tr. 26-27; AE D \u2013 AE F) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concern about drug involvement and substance \nmisuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and  \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance abuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese proceedings were initiated after Applicant self-reported her marijuana use \non her June 21, 2019 SF-86, and later during her August 19, 2019 OPM interview. \nThese self-disclosures establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(g). Further review is required. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists two conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in this case, I find application of AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b), 26(b)(1), 26(b)(2), and 26(b)(3) is appropriate and mitigating. \nConcerning AG \u00b6 26(a), there are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when \nconduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the record within the parameters set by the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR \nCase No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana \noccurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence \nshows, \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \n\u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \nIn ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board \nreversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the absence of drug use \nfor five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 \nplus years of drug use, and gave too little weight to lifestyle change and therapy. For the \nrecency analysis, the Appeal Board stated: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although \nthe passage of three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did \nnot, standing alone, compel the administrative judge to apply Criminal \nConduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of law, the Judge erred by \nfailing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply that \nmitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) \nwith ISCR Case No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe \nadministrative judge articulated a rational basis for why she had doubts \nabout the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at alcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) \n(citation format corrections added). \nApplicant\u2019s last marijuana use was in June 2019, about 24 months before her \nhearing. Her marijuana use occurred infrequently from 1997 to 2019, a period of 22 \nyears. She used marijuana during 9 of those 22 years, with the most recent use in July \n2019 after completing her June 2019 SF-86. Her reason for using marijuana when she \ndid was to deal with her anxiety issues. She did not hold a clearance during any of the \ntimes she used marijuana, however, using marijuana after completing her SF-86 is \narguably of the most concern in this case. I found Applicant\u2019s explanation credible that \nshe did not believe her use of marijuana with her father while waiting at a Canadian \nairport was wrong. She clearly recognizes the significance of that incorrect assumption. \nThe record contains persuasive evidence that Applicant has turned the corner on \nachieving drug abstinence. She recognizes the importance of being a responsible family \nmember and employee, and that her actions can affect others. She also fully recognizes \nthat there is no room for any drug use while holding a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s \nself-reflection, change in behavior, and support from her family, friends, and associates, \nin addition to her 24 months of sobriety, are indicative of an individual who wants to right \nher course. The absence of evidence of more recent or extensive drug use, and her \npromise not to use illegal drugs in the future eliminates doubts about her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment with respect to abstaining from illegal \ndrug use. In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board \nreversed an unfavorable security clearance decision because the administrative judge \nfailed to explain why drug use was not mitigated after the passage of more than six \nyears from the previous drug abuse. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists three ways Applicant can demonstrate her intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. Applicant has engaged in a significant amount of self-\nreflection regarding her behavior, and recognizes that such behavior is incompatible \nwith holding a security clearance. Applicant has committed to disassociation from drug-\nusing associates and contacts, with the exception of her father, discussed above, and \navoiding any environment where drugs are used. She clarified her answer to the OPM \ninvestigator regarding future drug use. Lastly, she provided a signed statement of intent \nto abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s reference letters document that she is an individual who possesses \ncharacter and integrity. Applicant\u2019s work performance evaluations reflect the caliber of \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nthe contribution she is making as an employee.

As an employee, she is \nviewed as reliable, a constant learner, and an individual with integrity. At her hearing, \nApplicant acknowledged that future drug abuse is incompatible with her future career \nand family plans, and manifested a steadfast commitment to continue lifestyle changes \nconsistent with total abstinence of involvement with all other illegal drugs. \nIn evaluating Applicant\u2019s credibility, I did so after assessing her demeanor, overall \ncandor on other matters, and reputation among her superiors and peers. Given the \ncircumstances of Applicant\u2019s background, her explanation for her actions, and her \nsubsequent actions, I find credible her assertion that she will not use any illegal \nsubstance in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b), 26(b)(1), 26(b)(2), 26(b)(3) apply. Drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination whether to grant national security eligibility must be an \noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and \nthe whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion under Guideline H is incorporated \nin this whole-person section. However, further comments are warranted. \nApplicant has been and is willing to maintain conduct expected of one entrusted \nwith a security clearance. She self-reported her drug use knowing that such disclosure \ncould jeopardize her clearance eligibility. I note that her drug use did not occur while she \nheld a clearance. Applicant\u2019s employer, friends, and family support her. She has a \nhistory of stable employment and a strong work ethic. This level of support and self-\nintrospection should ensure her continued success. Applicant demonstrated the correct \nattitude and commitment to remaining drug free. She has multiple indicators of a mature, \nstable, responsible, and trustworthy person. She was serious, candid, and credible at \nthe hearing. She appears to have cooperated fully and provided truthful information \nduring the security clearance process and during her OPM interview. She made a good \nimpression on me during the hearing. I believe Applicant has learned from this \nexperience, and is committed to remaining drug-free. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n      \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

Applicant pled no contest to the charge of \nPossession of a Narcotic. \nApplicant was sentenced to pay court cost, fines, and \ncomplete community service, attend Narcotic Anonymous meetings, and take \nsubstance abuse courses through a court-required program. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nIn October 2017, Applicant failed a random drug test administered by his then \nemployer.

(Government Exhibit 2, and Tr. pp. 34 and 43.) \nApplicant states that he has no intentions of ever using any illegal drug in the future. \n(Government Exhibit 1.) \nGuideline J:  Criminal Conduct  \nApplicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct creates doubt about his judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It also calls into question his ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nIn addition to his illegal drug involvement, Applicant has an extensive criminal \nhistory involving a number of alcohol-related arrests. \nIn about March 2001, Applicant was arrested the first time and charged with \nDriving Under the Influence of Alcohol/Drugs (DUI.) \nApplicant was convicted and \nsentenced to three years probation. \nIn about September 2006, Applicant was arrested a second time and charged \nwith DUI. Applicant had been out with his girlfriend, shooting pool and drinking. As they \nleft the bar, Applicant did not have his seatbelt on. \nAs he drove away from the stop \nlight, he was pulled over by the police. The officer smelled alcohol on Applicant\u2019s breath \nand administered the field sobriety test and the breathalyzer. Applicant failed the tests \nand was arrested and taken into custody. At court, Applicant pled no contest, and was \nsentenced to pay court cost, fines, and placed on probation for 36 months. \nIn about September 2012, Applicant was arrested a third time and charged with \nHit and Run, Property Damage. Applicant had been consuming beer at a local bar for \nabout five hours prior to the car accident that led to the Hit and Run, Property Damage \ncharge. He got into a verbal altercation with another patron. When he was leaving the \nbar at about midnight, he was concerned that he may be followed by the individuals who \nwere arguing with him. As he left the bar, Applicant was intoxicated and was not in \ncontrol or paying attention while driving. Applicant side swiped a parked vehicle on the \ncurb. He made it home, and had no encounter with police. Several days passed, and \nApplicant felt bad about what had happened, and decided to call the police. Applicant \nwas advised to make an in-person report at the local police precinct. \nApplicant \ncomplied, and was arrested for and charged with Hit and Run, Property Damage. \nApplicant was sentenced to pay restitution, was placed on 36 months probation, \nrequired to pay court costs, and fines, and required to do 100 hours of community \nservice. \nIn about December 2013, Applicant was arrested a fourth time and charged with \nDUI Alcohol/Drugs. Applicant had two beers over a four hour period while at a car \nshow. Applicant then left and went to a bar where he consumed six to seven beers over \na two hour period. When he left the bar, he peeled out of the parking lot, and launched \ninto traffic at an excessive speed, and was pulled over by the police. \nApplicant \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunderwent a field sobriety test and breathalyzer and failed.

Due to overcrowded facilities, he served only 3 days in jail, and was let \ngo.  An ignition lock was placed on his vehicle. \nThe SOR alleges that in about March 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith DUI. This was not an additional arrest. Apparently on this date, Applicant was \nconvicted of the incident that occurred on December 2013. \nInformation set forth above under Guideline H is also adjudicated under this \nguideline. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nApplicant\u2019s history of excessive alcohol abuse leading to questionable judgment, \nand the failure to control impulses, raises questions about his reliability and \ntrustworthiness. \nApplicant began consuming alcohol after graduating from high school. By age \ntwenty-one he was drinking every weekend and consuming between eight and twelve \nbeers on the weekends. Applicant would rarely drink alcohol during the weekdays. \nApplicant explained that he would frequently go \u201cclubbing\u201d where he would dance and \ndrink. \nAs time passed, Applicant\u2019s drinking increased to the point where he was \nregularly consuming between twelve to eighteen beers on the weekends. When his \ndaughter was born, he slowed his drinking down for a period, but he has never tried to \nstop drinking completely. (Tr. p. 64.) Applicant does not believe that he has an alcohol \nproblem. He explained that his goal is to stop drinking completely, but he is not there \nyet. (Tr. pp. 61-66.) \nApplicant has never attended an alcohol rehabilitation program. He does not and \nhas never attended Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous voluntarily. He has \nonly completed the court ordered alcohol education courses and counseling related to \nthe sentencing imposed by the court for his violations. Applicant is currently working \nwith his pastor who is counseling him, and encouraging him to get baptized, which the \npastor believes will gradually help to improve other areas of Applicant\u2019s life. Applicant \nstates that he no longer drinks and drives. Now, he only drinks at home at dinner. \nApplicant\u2019s daughter has told him more than once that she does not like him to drink \nalcohol. She has asked him not to drink, especially on her upcoming quinceneara. (Tr. \np. 67.)   \nApplicant is involved in his church, and plans to get deeper into his faith and \ncontinue to improve himself. He is embarrassed by his past misconduct. He believes \nthat it has taken him some time for him to get his head straighten out. He admits that \nhe has had an attitude problem. Now, instead of abusing alcohol and drugs, he spends \ntime with his family.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 sets forth three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and\nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this\nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not\nlimited to: \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable. Spanning over a thirty year \nperiod, from 1987 to November 2017, Applicant abused illegal drugs, including cocaine, \nmarijuana, or crystal methamphetamine at various times. Applicant has not shown the \nrequisite good judgment, reliability and trustworthiness necessary to be eligible for \naccess to classified information. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgement, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted \nor convicted. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Neither of the conditions are applicable: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job \ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement. \nApplicant violated both Federal and state law by using, possessing and \npurchasing illegal drugs. Cocaine and alcohol were Applicant\u2019s drugs of choice. He \nstated that he has used cocaine between May 2007 and November 2017 about 100 \ntimes. He used marijuana between February 1987 and March 2015, mainly in high \nschool, and a few times since then. He also used crystal methamphetamine on three \noccasions in 2007 while at a party. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal police record reflects at least two drug-related arrests for \nPossession of Narcotics, in April 2002, and January 2005. In addition to his narcotic-\nrelated arrests, Applicant has been arrested on four occasions for DUI, and one arrest \nfor Hit and Run/Property Damage. The most recent of these arrests occurred in March \n2013. Applicant stated that the conviction for the 2013 arrest and charge occurred in \n2014, and there was no evidence presented to the contrary. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct demonstrates poor judgment, immaturity and a total \ndisregard for the law. This is inexcusable. Applicant has not established that he is \nsufficiently reliable and trustworthy to access classified information. \nHis extensive \nillegal drug use and his arrests for possession of controlled substances gives rise to \nserious concerns about his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness, both because of \nthe nature of the offenses, and the circumstances surrounding the offenses. \nThe \nbefore-mentioned disqualifying conditions have been established and are not mitigated. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The disqualifying conditions raised by the evidence are: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n(b) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual was diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \nConcerning his alcohol abuse, the evidence shows that Applicant incurred at \nleast four arrests and charges for DUI, and one Hit and Run, Property Damage charge. \nThese incidents raise serious security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c). \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security \nconcerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern  of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear  and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant failed to introduce sufficient evidence of rehabilitation. Applicant has a \nlong pattern of abusive addictive behavior. Whether it has been with illegal narcotics or \nwith alcohol, he has abused these substances for many years, and they have caused \nhim many problems with law enforcement. Although it has not been determined if he is \nan alcoholic or is alcohol dependent, he has had at least five alcohol-related arrests \naway from work, the most recent one occurred as recently as 2013. Since 2013, \nApplicant has continued to consume alcohol. Applicant states that his goal is to quit \ndrinking, but he is not at that point yet.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H, J and G in my whole-person analysis. Based upon the facts and analysis \nset forth above, Applicant has failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that \nhe meets the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse, \nCriminal Conduct, and Alcohol Consumption security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.e. \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.f. \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

(Items 6 \nand 7.) Applicant provided no documents in response to the SOR or the FORM. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \n2 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nDiscussion \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. AG \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the concern \nand the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \nThe overall concern is: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may \nindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. AG \u00b6 18. \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions or factors: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has had problematic financial \nconditions sufficient to raise a trustworthiness concern under Guideline F. She appears \nto be unable or unwilling to satisfy her debts, and she has a history of not meeting her \nfinancial obligations. Therefore, AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (b), and (c) apply. The next inquiry is \nwhether any of the mitigating conditions apply. \nThe debts that raised trustworthiness concerns were delinquent when the SOR \nwas issued in November 2020 and remained in arrears when the FORM was filed in May \n2021. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nIn her Answer, Applicant pleaded that her delinquent debts were caused by the \n2008-2009 recession, illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths of family members. She did \nnot provide any explanation describing how any one or more of those eventualities \ncaused her financial delinquencies. Nevertheless, I have assumed that those conditions \ncaused Applicant\u2019s indebtedness and were conditions largely beyond her control. That, \nhowever, does not end the inquiry under AG \u00b6 20(b). Applicant must also show that she \nacted responsibly under the adverse circumstances she confronted. Here, Applicant took \nno actions save to await the running of the applicable statutes limitations. The Board has \nlong held that reliance on a state\u2019s statute of limitations is not a good-faith effort to resolve \nfinancial difficulties. ADP Case No. 06-18900 at 5 (App. Bd.Jun.6, 2008). Therefore, AG \n\u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nConclusion \nThe record creates doubt about Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, good judgment, and \nability to protect sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence \nor vice versa. I also considered the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). \nAccordingly, I conclude that Applicant did not meet her ultimate burden of \npersuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant her eligibility for access to sensitive information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j:   \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n   Against Applicant \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive information. \nPhilip J.

The SOR alleged facts that raise security concerns articulated in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to \nbe effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. Specifically, this case is \ngoverned by Guideline B (Foreign Influence). \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. On \nNovember 24, 2021, I scheduled this case to be heard remotely using a video \nconferencing platform on December 8, 2021. The parties appeared as scheduled. I \nreceived a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 16. \nDepartment Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2. GX 1 was \nadmitted without objection; however, for reasons discussed at the hearing (Tr. 16 \u2013 22), I \nsua sponte excluded GX 2, a summary of subject\u2019s personal subject interview with a \ngovernment investigator on August 24, 2018. GX 2 is included in the case file for possible \nreference on appeal. \nDepartment Counsel also proffered Hearing Exhibits (HX) 1 (Discovery Letter from \nDepartment Counsel to Applicant, dated November 9, 2020) and HX 2 (Request for \nAdministrative Notice, dated October 27, 2020). Both exhibits are included in the record. \nThrough HX 2, Department Counsel asked that I take administrative notice of the \ninformation contained therein about Iraq. I granted Department Counsel\u2019s request and \nhave considered herein the information provided as appropriate. Appellant appeared as \nscheduled, testified, and proffered post-hearing Applicant Exhibit (AX) A, which I admitted \nwithout objection. (Tr. 21 \u2013 22) \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s mother (SOR 1.a) and three sisters (SOR 1.b) \nare citizens and residents of Iraq. The SOR also alleged that three of Applicant\u2019s four \nbrothers are citizens and residents of Iraq serving in the Kurdish military forces there \n(SOR 1.c); and that his fourth brother is a citizen and resident of Iraq working for Kurdish \nsecurity forces there (SOR 1.d). Lastly, the SOR alleged that Applicant \u201cmaintain[s] \ncontact with several Iraqi citizens on a continual basis\u201d (SOR 1.e). Applicant admitted \nwithout explanation all of the SOR allegations. In addition to the facts established by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 40 years old. He is one of seven children, all of whom were born and \nraised in Iraq. Only one of his siblings is younger than him. Applicant immigrated to the \nUnited States in April 2012, and he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2017. \nHe and his wife, a native-born U.S. citizen, have been married since June 2014.

(GX 1; Tr. \n50 \u2013 51) \nBetween June 2007 and January 2012, Applicant worked in Iraq for U.S. \ncontractors doing business in support of U.S. military missions there. Most of his work \ninvolved translator and linguist duties in support of U.S.-led training of new Iraqi police \nofficers. None of his work required a security clearance and there is no indication in the \nrecord that he was ever vetted for access to sensitive information. Between January and \nApril 2012, Applicant also worked as a paramedic in his native province in Iraq. Before \nthe U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, Applicant had studied for three years to become a \nmathematics teacher there. (GX 1; Tr. 7, 27 \u2013 32) \nIn April 2018, the sponsor of his request for clearance extended to Applicant a job \noffer for work as a linguist in Iraq. That job offer is still pending and contingent on his \neligibility for a security clearance. After arriving in the United States and holding a variety \nof jobs, he obtained his commercial driver\u2019s license (CDL) in March 2014 and found work \nas a delivery driver sufficient to support his family while waiting for his clearance to be \nadjudicated. (GX 1; Tr. 28, 52) \nApplicant and his wife bought a house in the United States in February 2016. In \nMay 2021, Applicant sold the house and relocated with his family to his hometown in Iraq. \nHe relies on a cousin in the United States to forward his mail to him. Applicant deposited \nthe proceeds from the sale of his home in a U.S. bank because he does not trust the \nbanking system in Iraq. He has been living off those funds while he waits for his clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s wife now works in Iraq as a teacher, and he is seeking non-governmental \nemployment in Iraq while he continues to wait for his clearance. He expressed a general \nintent to return to the United States, but he has no immediate plans to do so. It may be \nthat Applicant\u2019s wife and children will return to the United States; however, he expects to \nstay and work in Iraq if he receives a clearance. (GX 1; Tr. 45, 55, 65) \nApplicant, his wife, and their children lived with family members when they first \nemigrated to Iraq in 2021. He is still in regular contact with his elderly mother and with his \nsisters who live in the same region of Iraq as Applicant. His mother is elderly and Applicant \nvisits her when he can. In so doing, he also sees his sisters, who live in the same area \nas his mother. (Tr. 33 \u2013 35) \nThree of Applicant\u2019s brothers are on active military duty in a provincial militia \nfighting Islamic State and other insurgents. The fourth brother works for a provincial \nsecurity and intelligence force supporting the same mission. Before Applicant returned to \nIraq, he had at least monthly contact with them. He still is in regular contact with them \nexcept when their duties take them away from the area where Applicant and his family \nnow live. Applicant\u2019s mother and sisters have never worked outside the home, and they \nlive in the same region as Applicant. Before he returned to Iraq, Applicant had at least \nmonthly contact with his mother and one sister, and weekly contact with his other sister. \nHe now talks with his mother and sisters at least weekly.

Applicant \nalso has extended family, such as cousins, aunts and uncles, as well as some friends in \nIraq with whom he has kept in touch through social media. In-person contact with them is \nrare. (GX 1; Tr. 38 \u2013 44) \nBefore Applicant left Iraq in 2012, he worked closely with U.S. Army personnel at \na forward operating base (FOB) in Iraq. Most of his work supported U.S. military police \nunits involved in training Iraqi security forces. For his work with the U.S. military, he did \nnot receive a fully adjudicated security clearance; rather, he was briefed on an ad hoc \nbasis by unit leaders if the need for accessing sensitive information arose. Applicant \nexpressed pride in the work he has done for the U.S. military and in support of U.S. \ninterests in Iraq. His immediate family is aware that he worked for the U.S. military, and \nsome of them know that he now is awaiting employment with a U.S. company for work in \nIraq. (AX A; Tr. 29 \u2013 32, 51 \u2013 52) \nTo properly assess the security significance of these facts within the adjudicative \nguideline at issue, I have taken administrative notice of certain facts regarding Iraq as \npresented in HX 2. Of particular note is the continued inability of its freely elected \ngovernment to quell the violence and instability that persist in parts of Iraq. These \nconditions are fueled and perpetrated by terrorist groups affiliated with Al-Qaeda and \nISIS, as well as by Sunni insurgents and Iranian-backed Shiite militias. As a result, some \nparts of Iraq remain wholly unstable. Even the city of Baghdad is still subject to random \nacts of terrorist violence. (GX 4) \nU.S. citizens and interests in Iraq remain at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist \nviolence. The U.S. State Department has advised against all individual travel to Iraq. The \nability of the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services to U.S. citizens outside Baghdad \nand the southern city of Basra is extremely limited given the security environment. ISIS \nagain controls significant portions of Iraq\u2019s territory, and numerous other terrorist and \ninsurgent groups are active in Iraq. Such groups regularly attack both Iraqi security forces \nand civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also threaten U.S. citizens and western \ncompanies throughout Iraq. U.S. Government and western interests remain possible \ntargets for attacks. Additionally, there are significant human-rights problems in Iraq. \nWidespread corruption, as well as abuses by Iraqi security forces in response to acts of \nviolence by terrorists and others, have undermined confidence in the Iraqi government \nand its judiciary. Human-rights violations by Iraqi law enforcement are not uncommon and \nare not being addressed when identified. Those include killing, kidnapping, and extorting \ncivilians, as well as inhumane conditions in detention and prison facilities, arbitrary arrest \nand lengthy pretrial detainment, denial of fair public trial, limits on freedom of expression, \nfreedom of the press, censorship of religion, limits on peaceful assembly, and societal \nabuses of women. The various terrorist and militia organizations are also responsible for \nsignificant human rights abuses in Iraq.

(See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; see also AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information.

They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAvailable information shows that Applicant has both close and casual ties to \ncitizens of Iraq residing in Iraq. It also shows that he continues to be in contact with those \npersons, at times frequently. This information reasonably raises the security concern \nexpressed under this adjudicative guideline. More specifically, conditions in Iraq present \na heightened risk that Applicant\u2019s relatives and associates in Iraq (or Applicant himself \nnow that he lives there) may be vulnerable to pressure or coercion as a means of \ncompromising Applicant\u2019s willingness and ability to protect sensitive U.S. information. The \ndisqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 7(a) applies: \ncontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nThe record also supports application of AG \u00b6 7(b): \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n6 \n \n \nThree of Applicant\u2019s brothers serve in a foreign military organization in Iraq. The \nfourth works for a foreign intelligence organization. Applicant\u2019s close ties to family \nmembers in those circumstances pose a potential conflict with respect to his work with \nU.S. interests and access to sensitive information. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBy contrast, I have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 8 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nThe record does not support application of any of these mitigating conditions. \nApplicant has continuous contact with immediate family members -- his mother, siblings, \nand others. These contacts are more frequently in person now that he, too, lives in Iraq. \nAlthough he lived and worked in the United States starting in 2012, all of his personal \ninterests now are in Iraq. He sold his house in the United States and returned with his \nfamily to Iraq pending his request for a security clearance. This is not simply an extended \nvisit to see his mother and siblings, and to introduce his children to their relatives and \nIraqi heritage. Applicant\u2019s wife, a native-born U.S. citizen, is now working as a teacher, \nand Applicant is seeking employment in Iraq unrelated to his pending job offer in the \nUnited States. He was already working in the U.S. and had put down roots as a \nhomeowner; however, he no longer has any \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the United States\u201d that might cause him \u201cto resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Finally, Applicant\u2019s ties in Iraq are mostly familial, which by \ndefinition, are not casual. On balance, the security concerns about foreign influence are \nnot mitigated. \nI also evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s past work with the U.S. military and his time living in the United States \nindicate that Applicant is a loyal American citizen and would be dedicated to any future \nwork in support of U.S. interests. It may be that his brothers were serving in foreign military \nand intelligence positions at the same time Applicant was working with the U.S. military. \nNonetheless, those circumstances were not subjected to the same scrutiny now being \napplied through this background investigation and adjudication. Further, Applicant\u2019s \ncircumstances now reflect a less favorable balance toward U.S. interests.

The debts are established \nby credit reports from January 2018, September 2019, January 2021, and August 2022; \nAppellant\u2019s SOR admissions; and his hearing testimony.

(Tr. 21; GE 5-9; SOR answer) \nApplicant admitted all the SOR debts during his testimony. He also admitted that \nhe has had financial problems for about 15 years, going back to 2007. He described \nhimself as \u201cfinancially illiterate\u201d in his younger years. He claimed that he made efforts in \nthe past to contact his creditors to work out payment arrangements. He did not \ndocument any finalized payment plans with any of the SOR creditors. He admitted that \nhe has not made any payments toward any of the SOR debts. He believed that once the \ndebts went into collection status there was nothing he could do to address them. He \nalso claimed that he disputed some debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.p-1.r), but the debts were \nconfirmed by the credit bureaus. All the SOR debts remain unresolved (Tr. 21-22, 28-\n29, 62, 64; GE 4-9)   \nApplicant\u2019s gross monthly income is approximately $12,000.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant accumulated numerous delinquent debts, which remain unpaid or \nunresolved. I find both of the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and    \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and he admitted that he has not paid or resolved \nthem. He failed to produce evidence showing that recurrence of his financial problems is \nunlikely. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \nWhile providing financial support for two households and paying child support \nfrom an earlier marriage are conditions beyond his control, he has not acted responsibly \nby doing nothing to resolve his debts, except apparently contacting some creditors \nabout possible payment arrangements with no meaningful success. AG \u00b6 20(b) is \npartially applicable. \nAside from his contact with a credit counselor to help him qualify for a home \npurchase, Applicant did not present evidence of financial counseling. He failed to \nestablish good-faith efforts to resolve his debts. Given the unpaid status of his debts, \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and AG 20(d) do not \napply, except as to SOR \u00b6 1.m. Although he took responsibility for all the debts, during \nhis testimony he referenced some disputes he made toward certain debts. However, he \nfailed to provide documentation supporting any of those disputes. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military (including his three deployments) and federal \ncontractor service, and the circumstances surrounding his indebtedness. However, I \nalso considered that he has made insufficient efforts to resolve his debts. He has not \nestablished a meaningful track record of financial responsibility, which causes me to \nquestion his ability to resolve his debts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. (I \nconsidered the exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, \nAppendix C, dated June 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case.) \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.l, 1.n-1.r: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph: 1.m:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, three of the SOR allegations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.c., and 1.e.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been sponsored by a defense contractor for an unspecified position since about August 2021. She previously served as supply chain analyst with another employer from May 2018 until she was hired by her current sponsor. Her formal education was not reported, but as noted by Department Counsel, she may have attended higher educational institutions because her credit reports report student loans. She enlisted in the U.S. Navy Reserve in October 1988 and served on active duty until January 1993, when she was honorably discharged. In June 1997, she reenlisted in the U.S. Navy and served on active duty until June 2017, when she was honorably retired as a petty officer first class (E-6). She was granted a secret clearance while on active duty. She was married in 1990 and divorced in 1991. She remarried in 1991 and divorced in 1996. She did not report any children in her SF 86, but during an interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) she mentioned having a son.

On March 31, 2022, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her under Executive Order (Exec.

A complete copy of the Government\u2019s \nfile of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) on July 11, 2022, and she was afforded an opportunity \nafter receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as \nwell as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM \non July 20, 2022. Her response was due on August 19, 2022. While not timely, on \nSeptember 8, 2022, Applicant submitted a number of documents to which there were no \nobjections. The record closed on September 8, 2022. The case was assigned to me on \nOctober 3, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, three of the SOR \nallegations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.c., and 1.e.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are \nincorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, \nand upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been \nsponsored by a defense contractor for an unspecified position since about August 2021. \nShe previously served as supply chain analyst with another employer from May 2018 until \nshe was hired by her current sponsor. Her formal education was not reported, but as \nnoted by Department Counsel, she may have attended higher educational institutions \nbecause her credit reports report student loans. She enlisted in the U.S. Navy Reserve in \nOctober 1988 and served on active duty until January 1993, when she was honorably \ndischarged. In June 1997, she reenlisted in the U.S. Navy and served on active duty until \nJune 2017, when she was honorably retired as a petty officer first class (E-6). She was \ngranted a secret clearance while on active duty. She was married in 1990 and divorced \nin 1991. She remarried in 1991 and divorced in 1996. She did not report any children in \nher SF 86, but during an interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) she mentioned having a son. \nFinancial Considerations  \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 2 (Answer to the SOR, dated April 5, 2022); \nItem 4 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated November 3, \n2018); Item 5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated August 29, 2019); Item 6 (Verato Credit \nReport, dated February 18, 2022); and Item 8 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated \nDecember 4, 2018). \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nOn August 22, 2008, the Department of the Navy (DON) CAF issued the then \nAppellant a Letter of Intent to Deny Eligibility for Security Clearance setting forth security \nconcerns rising under the guideline for financial considerations (delinquent student loans \nand delinquent rent) and personal conduct. Based on the information furnished to the \nDON CAF, on December 18, 2008, the then Appellant was granted a conditional security \ndetermination with a caution to continue her student loan rehabilitation payments. In 2009, \nthe conditions on her security clearance were released as she had already satisfied them. \n(Item 7) No other financial issues arose until the present ones. \nIn her September 2018 SF 86, although she denied having any delinquent debts, \nApplicant wrote: \nI ask that you consider my security clearance. I\u2019ve been in a medical \nhardship since 11/2015 which I had major surgery on my neck 1/2017 \nbefore my DUI. I truly was unaware of my actions and I have made every \npossible way to make good of a bad situation. During my illness I fell (sic) \nbehind on bills being in the hospital from three weeks to a month learning \nto walk and talk again after recovering from my medical outcome and while \nin a coma awaiting for my retirement and disability check which put me on \nthe oust with my normal responsibilities. Now I\u2019m back on my feet making \npositive effort to get my life back. I am able to submit documentation of my \ndownfall in the last year. \n(Item 3 at 41) \nDuring her December 2018 OPM interview, Applicant volunteered that she owed \nmoney to the hospital for medical bills as well as to several other creditors. She discussed \nother accounts, and while she acknowledged several of them, she also claimed to be \nunaware of others. She indicated that she had either paid, was negotiating proposed \npayments, or was paying off several accounts. She set up automatic payments which she \nsaid made her current financial situation much better. Although she was given the \nopportunity to provide documentation to corroborate her contentions pertaining to her \nfinancial accounts, she failed to do so during the interview or subsequent to the interview. \n(Item 6 at 5-6) \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant again stated that she had struggled since \n2017 when she fell into a coma for weeks in October. It took a lot of time for her to get up \non many of her responsibilities and that she had taken care of them. (Item 2 at 1) Although \nI cannot find the actual source of portions of statements attributed by Department Counsel \nto her, the following was stated by Department Counsel: \nApplicant states she initially ran into financial trouble after she was given an \noverdose of medication by medical professionals treating her for neck and \nback injuries in about 2017. After the overdose, Applicant states she was in \na coma for a period of time, and that after the coma, she remained in \nmedical rehabilitation where she had to learn to walk again. She was unable \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nto work during this period. She fell behind on debts while she awaited her \nNavy retired pay and Veterans Affairs disability pay. \n(FORM at 3) \nOn August 9, 2022 \u2013 five months after the SOR was issued \u2013 for a monthly fee of \n$737.33 to commence on September 30, 2022, Applicant engaged the professional \nservices of a law firm to represent her in connection with ongoing disputes with certain \ncreditors. The representation was not a debt settlement or debt management \nprogram nor any other form of debt relief or credit repair. (Emphasis added) (Retainer \nAgreement attached to Response to the FORM) \nThe SOR alleged nine still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $36,613, as \nset forth below: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to a note loan with an unpaid balance of $11,078 that was placed \nfor collection and charged off. (Item 4 at 6; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 2) Applicant attributed\nthe delinquency to a loan officer who is no longer with the creditor who she claimed told \nher to stop making payments because her application for a refinance was being \nprocessed. A new loan officer disputed that scenario and told her she was delinquent. \n(Item 2 at 1-2) During her OPM interview, she indicated that she would either pay $800 \nright away or make $100 payments to pay off the account either by December 22, 2018, \nor by June 2019. (Item 8 at 5-6) Applicant did neither, and the account is listed among \nthose with which she has a dispute with the creditor. (Retainer Agreement List of Creditors\nin Dispute) Applicant did not indicate the basis for the dispute, especially after stating that \nshe intended to pay the account off. However, on May 24, 2019, Applicant started making \nperiodic payments to a law firm representing the creditor, and as of February 11, 2021, \nshe had paid them $8,915.90. She made another payment of $550 on July 16, 2021. \n(Payment Activity Report, attached to Answer to the SOR; Statement of Account,\nattached to Answer to the SOR) It is unclear if the account is still in the process of being \nresolved or if it has already been resolved.  \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.h. refer to a loan account with an unpaid balance of $9,194 that \nwas placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser who was seeking $8,479. (Item 2 \nat 1; Item 4 at 6; Item 6 at 2; Item 8 at 6) During her OPM interview, she indicated that \nshe would start making payments, and expected to satisfy the account in June 2019. \n(Item 8 at 6) She failed to do so. Instead, on April 8, 2022, she agreed to a payment \narrangement under which, commencing on April 30, 2022, she would have 12 automatic \nmonthly deductions of $282.64 from her bank account to pay off the account. (Statement, \nattached to Answer to the SOR) Applicant did not submit any documentation to support \nher contentions that she is currently making payments to the debt purchaser. Moreover, \nthe account is listed among those with which she has a dispute. (Retainer Agreement List \nof Creditors in Dispute) Applicant did not indicate the basis for the dispute, especially \nsince she claims that she is making payments on the account. In the absence of proof of \neven one payment, I conclude that the account is not yet in the process of being resolved.  \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. refers to a loan account with an unpaid balance of $1,505 that was \nplaced for collection.

On April 11, 2022, she agreed to a payment \narrangement under which, commencing on April 22, 2022, she would have six automatic \nmonthly deductions of approximately $251 from her bank account to pay of the account. \n(Statement, attached to Answer to the SOR) Applicant did not submit any documentation \nto support her contentions that she made the payments to the creditor. In the absence of \nproof of even one payment, I conclude that the account is not yet in the process of being \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. refers to medical account with an unpaid balance of $85 that was \nplaced for collection. (Item 4 at 13; Item 5 a 2; Item 6 at 3) Applicant contended that she \npaid the creditor on April 22, 2022, but she failed to submit any documentation to support \nher contention that she made the payment. In the absence of proof of any payment, I \nconclude that the account has not yet been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. refers to a credit union credit-card account with a balance of $14,755 \nof which $1,435 was 120 days past due. (Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 3) Applicant contends that \nthe account is in the creditor\u2019s recovery department to set up a direct deposit payment in \nMay 2022. (Item 2 at 1) However, she submitted no documents to support her contentions \nthat such a repayment arrangement would be made or had actually been made. \nMoreover, the account is listed among those concerning which she has a dispute. \n(Retainer Agreement List of Creditors in Dispute) Applicant did not indicate the basis for \nthe dispute, especially since she claims that she is making payments on the account. In \nthe absence of proof of even one payment, I conclude that the account is not yet in the \nprocess of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. refers to a mortgage-loan account with a balance of $298,550 of which \n$4,362 was 90 days past due. (Item 5 at 1; Item 6 at 3) Applicant claims that the account \nis current as of April 2022, and that on April 29, 2022, she set up an unspecified payment \nfor May 2022. (Item 2 at 1) She failed to submit any documentation to support her \ncontention that she made the payment or set up a plan. In the absence of proof of any \npayment, I conclude that the account has not yet in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. refers to a medical account with an unpaid balance of $348 that was \nplaced for collection. (Item 5 at 2) Applicant claims that the account is currently under \ndispute, but failed to indicate the basis for the dispute other than the verbal comment from \nan unnamed representative of the creditor that \u201cthey never put anything on my report no \nrecord founded.\u201d (Item 2 at 1) The account was not one of those disputed accounts listed \nwith the law firm. In the absence of documentation regarding the account or a written \nstatement from the creditor, I conclude that the account has not yet in the process of \nbeing resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i. refers to a medical account with an unpaid balance of $127 that was \nplaced for collection.

In the absence of proof of any payment, I conclude that the account \nhas not yet been resolved. \nIt should be noted that Applicant submitted some documentation that could not be \naligned with any of the accounts alleged in the SOR. Along with her Answer to the SOR,\nshe submitted the following from the same debt collector: a receipt for $67.21, reflecting \na balance to an unidentified creditor of $224.03; a statement on an identified medical\naccount with an original balance of $827 (for which she was credited or paid $699.46) \nand a remaining balance of $127.54; and a statement on another identified medical\naccount with an original balance of $2,206 (for which she was credited or paid $2,109.51) \nand a remaining balance of $96.49. \n \n \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or anything to describe with \nany specificity her current financial situation. During mid-2021, Applicant was receiving \nretirement pay of approximately $1,576 per month; disability pay of approximately $3,258 \nper month; and salary of approximately $2,311 twice per month, for a total of \napproximately $9,456 per month. Department Counsel argued that Applicant\u2019s monthly \nincome from those three sources in 2018 was not much below that amount, and that she \nwas equipped with the financial means to start addressing her delinquent debts at that \ntime. Applicant did not report her current net monthly income, her monthly household \nexpenses, or any monthly debt payments (for even the most insignificant of her delinquent \ndebts). In the absence of such information, I am unable to determine if she has any \nmonthly remainder available for savings or spending. Despite her 2018 comments to the \nOPM investigator that she is much better financially as she has set up automatic \npayments, there is a paucity of evidence to indicate that her financial problems are now \nunder control, and it is difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position \nfinancially than she had been. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4.

The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7\n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this\ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s\nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that\nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I\nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR alleged nine still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $36,613. On \nits face, without any background information, Applicant\u2019s history of still-delinquent debts \nappears to present either an inability to satisfy debts, or a history of not meeting financial \nobligations. Despite her disputes regarding several of her debts, her initial declared \nwillingness to satisfy those debts is unambiguous. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been \nestablished, but AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply, but AG \u00b6 20 (e) does not apply. As \nnoted above, Applicant attributed her current financial situation to one factor: her health \nstruggles since 2017 when she fell into a coma for weeks in October, and the lengthy \nperiod of rehabilitation \u2013 situations that were largely beyond her control. Slowly she \narrived at a point where she sought legal assistance to address her delinquent accounts. \nHowever, rather than seeking financial counseling, debt relief, or credit repair services, \nshe chose to dispute certain accounts. She did not specify the reasons for her disputes, \nso I am unable to determine if she had a reasonable basis to dispute their legitimacy. But, \nat the same time she disputed some accounts, for reasons unexplained, she also started \nmaking payments. She claimed to have initiated a good-faith effort to repay several of her \noverdue creditors, and while she submitted documentation to support some of those \nclaims, she also failed to support other claims. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Between the date she first learned of her financial situation \nto the date she was interviewed by the OPM investigator in December 2018, and the date \nher response to the FORM was expected in October 2022, she made substantial claims, \nand in some cases, verifiable efforts, to address several of the delinquent debts as well \nas other debts. \nBased on the evidence, it is apparent that Applicant did not intentionally ignore her \ndelinquent accounts for a substantial multi-year period, but that her lingering health issues \nmay have delayed her responses. While she may not have acted timely and responsibly \nfor a fully medically-recovered individual, it is clear that she has made substantial efforts \nin eventually working with her creditors. The Appeal Board has previously commented on \nsuch a situation: \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In \nthis instance, Applicant has offered evidence, in some cases verified evidence, that she \nhad begun making such efforts as early as May 2019 \u2013 well before the SOR was issued. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant clearly stated that she \nintended to pay off her delinquent debts by certain dates. While those anticipated \ndeadlines were not met, she did eventually move forward and established verifiable \nrepayment plans with certain creditors, as well as verifiable evidence of payments to \ncertain creditors. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere \nis \nsome \ndisqualifying \nevidence \nregarding \nApplicant\u2019s \nfinancial \nconsiderations under the whole-person concept. Her history of financial difficulties and \ndelinquent debt is documented in the casefile. The SOR alleged nine still-delinquent \naccounts totaling approximately $36,613. While the issues first arose in 2017, Applicant \ndid not start to address any of them until 2019, and then apparently took no further action \nuntil she received the SOR in 2022. \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. \nShe has been sponsored by a defense contractor for an unspecified position since about \nAugust 2021. She previously served as supply chain analyst with another employer from \nMay 2018 until she was hired by her current sponsor. As noted by Department Counsel, \nshe may have attended higher educational institutions because her credit reports report \nstudent loans. She enlisted in the U.S. Navy Reserve in October 1988 and served on \nactive duty until January 1993, when she was honorably discharged. In June 1997, she \nreenlisted in the U.S. Navy and served on active duty until June 2017, when she was \nhonorably retired as a petty officer first class (E-6). She was granted a secret clearance \nwhile on active duty. Applicant initially ran into financial trouble after she was given an \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noverdose of medication by medical professionals treating her for neck and back injuries \nin about 2017. After the overdose, she was in a coma for a period of time, and after the \ncoma, she remained in medical rehabilitation where she had to learn to walk again. She \nwas unable to work during this period. She fell behind on debts while she awaited her \nNavy retired pay and Veterans Affairs disability pay. In 2019, well before the SOR was \nissued in 2022, she started rehabilitating her delinquent debts. Some of her resolution \nclaims are verified. There are no continuing doubts about her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of claimed or verifiable efforts to resolve the debts, and \nthe initial period of non-contact with her creditors brought about by her continuing health \nissues, but followed up by her resolution efforts, is positive and encouraging. Overall, the \nevidence leaves me without substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns arising from her financial difficulties. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) \n(1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i.: \nFor Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n13 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 66-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for her current employer since December 2015. She seeks to retain a security clearance, which she has held most recently since about 2016. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree earned in 1978, a master\u2019s degree earned in 1985, and a Ph.D. earned in 1989. She has never married, and she has no children. (Tr. at 24; GE 1, 5; AE B) The SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling about $26,787. The debts are established through credit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions. A number of events contributed to Applicant\u2019s financial problems. She paid $10,000 to help her mother move in 2002. In about 2004, her employer closed its branch in her geographic location.

She has worked for \nher current employer since December 2015. She seeks to retain a security clearance, \nwhich she has held most recently since about 2016. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree \nearned in 1978, a master\u2019s degree earned in 1985, and a Ph.D. earned in 1989. She \nhas never married, and she has no children. (Tr. at 24; GE 1, 5; AE B) \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling about $26,787. The debts are \nestablished through credit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions.  \nA number of events contributed to Applicant\u2019s financial problems. She paid \n$10,000 to help her mother move in 2002. In about 2004, her employer closed its \nbranch in her geographic location. She bought into a franchise that ultimately faiIed, \ncosting her thousands of dollars. In 2006, her mother had a series of strokes, and \nApplicant paid to move her to a state where she had family. Pipes burst during the \nwinter of 2013, causing expenses not covered by insurance. She had to pay deductibles \nand other costs for a surgery in 2015. In 2017, a drunk driver drove a truck through her \nfence and into her pool. Insurance did not pay for all of the repairs. She had surgery in \n2018 that was not covered by insurance. She had to pay the deductibles for a surgery in \n2019 and follow-up appointments in 2020. In 2019, she had expenses related to a \ncracked water pipe, a leaking faucet, and overhanging tree limbs. In 2021, a water pipe \nbroke. Insurance paid for the damages, but she had to pay the deductible. She had to \npay for the repairs to her pool after a snowstorm in 2022. (AE H, N, P, V, W, X) \nApplicant lived in State A from 2007 to 2012, and State B from 2012 to 2015. She \nmoved to State C in 2015 to accept her current job. She was making mortgage \npayments on houses in States A and B. She was paying to fix the house in State A so \nthat she could sell it, and she was also making repairs to the house in State B. She was \nunable to maintain payment on all of her bills, and several debts became delinquent. \n(Tr. at 34-35; GE 1; AE M, P) \nApplicant has owned a part-time jewelry business for about ten years. She sells \nher products at gem and jewelry trade shows, which can involve travel to other states. \nShe bought a camper in about 2014 for about $20,000 to $25,000. She planned to use \nthe camper to travel to trade shows and stay in the camper. She paid for the camper \nwith cash and a charge to a credit card for about $13,000. She stopped paying the \ncredit card in about 2017. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges the $13,896 balance on that debt. During \nher September 2019 background interview, Applicant stated that she was attempting to \nsell the camper and would put the proceeds toward this debt. She sold the camper for \n$5,000 this year. She used the proceeds from the sale to pay some bills, but not this \ndebt. (Tr. at 28-29, 32-34, 37-38; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE M) \nApplicant purchased a timeshare for campgrounds at the same time she bought \nthe camper. She felt that she could park the camper at various campgrounds when she \ntraveled for trade shows. She stated that she stopped making payments because she \nwas misled about the benefits from the timeshare and she was told that she could sell it \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nat any time, but she could not. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges the $3,986 balance on the financing \nfor the timeshare. (Tr. at 42-45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 5) \nApplicant purchased a water filtration system for her current home for about \n$6,400 or $6,500 in about 2017. The sales pitch was that the savings from the system \nwould equal the monthly payments on the financing for the system. The savings did not \nadd up to the monthly payments. In addition, the system took salt, which was another \nexpense. Applicant felt that she was misled, and she stopped making payments. She \nadmitted that the local water is \u201cnot that great,\u201d and it has \u201ca rather bad smell to it,\u201d so \nher water is better with the system. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges the $6,490 balance due on the \nfinancing on the system. The creditor placed a lien on Applicant\u2019s home for the loan. \nShe cannot refinance the mortgage or sell the home unless she pays the debt. (Tr. at \n39-42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 5; AE M) \nApplicant asserted that she paid the $748; $1,583; and $84 debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. The $748 and $1,583 debts are listed on the August 2020 Experian \ncredit report and the August 2021 Equifax credit report. They are not listed on any of the \ncredit reports obtained from the three credit reporting agencies in October 2022. They \nwere not dropped from the reports because of age, as the debts were less than seven \nyears old. She paid the $84 debt in April 2021. (Tr. at 45-46; GE 2-4; AE S-U) \nApplicant stated that she receives minimal income from her jewelry business, but \nit provides her some tax benefits. She is a part-time consultant for a food company. She \nearns about $17 an hour and works about four or five hours a week. She receives a \ndiscount on the company\u2019s food products, which helps with her expenses. She has \nabout $88,300 in a retirement account. (Tr. at 29-30; AE G, H, R) \nApplicant sold the houses in States A and B in 2016. She broke even on the \nhouse in State A. She made about $20,000 on the sale of the house in State B, which \nshe used as a down payment on her current house in State C. (Tr. at 36-37) \nApplicant plans to refinance the mortgage on her home and use the equity to pay \nher delinquent debts. She is unable to refinance at this time because her credit score is \ntoo low. She is working to improve the score. Except for the unpaid debts, her finances \nhave improved. She earns a good salary. She is working with an investment broker to \nbuild her retirement. She works whatever overtime is available. She has learned how to \nservice the pool herself. She lives a frugal lifestyle. She has a budget with an estimated \n$450 left over at the end of the month. The budget did not reflect any payments toward \nher delinquent debts. Potential upcoming expenses include straightening her teeth, \nrepairing issues from previous surgery, repairs and improvements to her home and pool \n(including new roof, windows, dishwasher, and air purifier; and repairs to sewer pipe, \nirrigation system, and deck), and a new car. (Tr. at 21-22, 47; AE A, D, F, J, L, Q, S-U, \nX) \nApplicant submitted documents attesting to her excellent job performance and \nmoral character. She is praised for her kindness, intelligence, courage, work ethic, \nprofessionalism, knowledge, expertise, and honesty.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation,\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nA number of events beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to her financial \nproblems. Some of the events, while beyond her control, are costs associated with \nhome ownership. AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that \u201cthe individual acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances.\u201d \nApplicant is credited with resolving three debts totaling $2,415. Those debts are \nmitigated. She has done nothing to resolve the remaining three debts, which total about \n$24,300. She told an investigator in September 2019 that she was attempting to sell the \ncamper and would put the proceeds toward the $13,896 debt. She sold the camper for \n$5,000 this year. She used the proceeds from the sale to pay some bills, but not the \ndebt associated with the camper. Her plan is to refinance her mortgage loan and use \nthe equity in her property to pay her delinquent debts. However, intentions to resolve \nfinancial problems in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment \nor other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, \n2013). \nApplicant has an extensive list of potential upcoming expenses. That list includes \nstraightening her teeth, repairing issues from previous surgery, repairs and \nimprovements to her home and pool (including new roof, windows, dishwasher, and air \npurifier; and repairs to sewer pipe, irrigation system, and deck), and a new car. That list, \nin conjunction with Applicant\u2019s heretofore disregard of her debts, leaves me with doubts \nthat the debts will ever be paid. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that she made a good-faith effort to pay her \ndebts. Her financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that financial \nconsiderations security concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 35-year-old electrician employed by defense contractors since May 2008. He has been employed by his current employer since November 2021. He received a security clearance in January 2009. Applicant testified that he was on paternity leave for six to twelve weeks after his daughter was born in June 2021. He used annual leave for part of the paternity leave and was on unemployment for the remainder. He was unable to be more specific about the length of his paternity leave or the amount of time that was unpaid. (Tr. 30-31.) Applicant attended college from 2005 to 2008 but did not receive a degree. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in computer technology in June 2011. (GX 1 at 12; Tr. 22, 25-26.) He married in July 2019. He has a three-year-old daughter and three stepchildren, ages 16, 14, and 10. (Tr. 24-25.) The SOR alleges seven delinquent debts totaling about $45,619. A January 2021 credit report attached to Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR reflected the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e and five charged-off debts not alleged in the SOR. It also alleged 15 student loans on which payments are current. The debts alleged in the SOR also are reflected in credit reports from March 2019 (GX 2), September 2019(GX 3) and April 2022 (GX 6.)

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on February 18, 2019. On \nAugust 13, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline F. The CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 25, 2021, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge.

On April 6, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nnotified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled to be conducted by video \nteleconference on April 27, 2022. After Applicant was unable to connect to the \nteleconference system, the hearing was rescheduled for May 2, 2022. I convened the \nhearing as rescheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 3, 5, and 6 were admitted \nin evidence without objection. Applicant testified but did not present the testimony of any \nother witnesses or submit any documentary evidence. I kept the record open until May \n16, 2022, to enable him to submit additional evidence. He did not submit anything further. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on May 12, 2022. \nEvidentiary Issue \nGX 4 is a summary of an interview of Applicant by a security investigator on March \n28, 2019. The summary was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. \nApplicant did not have a copy of GX 4 with him at the hearing, and I deferred a decision \non admitting it and gave him until April 16, 2022, to review it and decide if he was willing \nto waive the authentication requirement. He did not respond. Based on the lack of \nauthentication or a waiver, I have not admitted GX 4. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nin his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 35-year-old electrician employed by defense contractors since May \n2008. He has been employed by his current employer since November 2021. He received \na security clearance in January 2009. \nApplicant testified that he was on paternity leave for six to twelve weeks after his \ndaughter was born in June 2021. He used annual leave for part of the paternity leave and \nwas on unemployment for the remainder. He was unable to be more specific about the \nlength of his paternity leave or the amount of time that was unpaid. (Tr. 30-31.) \nApplicant attended college from 2005 to 2008 but did not receive a degree. He \nearned an associate\u2019s degree in computer technology in June 2011. (GX 1 at 12; Tr. 22, \n25-26.) He married in July 2019. He has a three-year-old daughter and three stepchildren, \nages 16, 14, and 10. (Tr. 24-25.) \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent debts totaling about $45,619. A January 2021 \ncredit report attached to Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR reflected the delinquent debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e and five charged-off debts not alleged in the SOR. It also \nalleged 15 student loans on which payments are current. The debts alleged in the SOR \nalso are reflected in credit reports from March 2019 (GX 2), September 2019(GX 3) and \nApril 2022 (GX 6.)

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a: (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s unemployment after the birth of his \ndaughter was a condition largely beyond his control. The illness of his parents and his \nfinancial help to them was a condition beyond his control. However, he has not acted \nresponsibly. He has been employed by federal contractors since May 2008, except for \nhis paternity leave, but he has ignored many of his delinquent debts. He admitted that he \nhas done nothing to resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.g. He offered an \nunconvincing explanation for his failure to address the debt for car repairs alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.e, asserting that the line was too long when he went to the repair shop to make a \npayment. \nThe adjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged in the SOR first, or establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nMay 21, 2008). \u201cRather, all that is required is than an applicant act responsibly given his \ncircumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). Applicant\u2019s good intentions \nhave not yet morphed into a \u201creasonable plan,\u201d and he has not submitted evidence \nindicating a serious intent to effectuate it. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of the type of \ncounseling contemplated by this mitigating condition, and he has not presented \u201cclear \nevidence\u201d that his financial problems are under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant admitted that he has done nothing to \nresolve the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.g. He claimed that he had paid or was making \npayments on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.f, but he submitted no \ndocumentary evidence to support his claims.

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. \nIn an August 27, 2020, response, Applicant addressed the allegations raised in \nthe SOR and requested a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) administrative judge. I was assigned the case on May 31, 2021. On August 20, \n2021, a notice of hearing was issued setting the matter for October 14, 2021. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled.

(Tr. 20, \n27, 58-59; Exs. 1-2) Having maintained a security clearance for 23 years, he knew \nfinancial responsibility and honoring his tax obligations were required.

Ultimately, he \ndid not recoup refunds owed to him that were unrecoverable because they \u201cwere out of \nstatutes of limitations. In satisfying all tax sums owed for the tax years at issue, however, \nhe thought the situation \u201cwould balance itself out. . . .\u201d (Tr. 25) \nThe SOR was issued on June 29, 2020.

K; Tr. 33) Consequently, all state tax sums at \nissue have been paid. (Tr. 39; Exs.

(Tr. 44; Ex. 2 at 6) The mounting problems with this account were \ndiscussed during his April 2019 interview. (Ex. 2) The loan was ultimately defaulted and \nturned over to a law firm. Applicant worked with the law firm and agreed to initially pay \n$1,200 a month toward the loan balance. (Tr. 41) The law firm eventually reduced to $869 \nand instituted a settlement agreement indicating the settlement amount due was $31,300. \nThis settlement agreement was signed in mid-June 2020, and scheduled to end \nby the end of May 2023. (Ex. F) After 16 timely payments, some or more exceeding the \n$869 a month agreed upon, the sum had been reduced to about $17,153 by September \n2021. (Tr. 43; Ex. G) Applicant has continued to make timely payments toward the goal \nof satisfying the obligation. (Tr. 43) \nToday, Applicant and his wife now work in concert to make sure all financial issues \nare in order. He drives a 12-year-old car, which he bought used and for which he since \nhas paid in full. (Tr. 74) His wife also drives a used car. Applicant maintains a retirement \nsavings account. He has not been on vacation in years. No longer relying on a commercial \ntax preparation computer program, he now relies on his new professional tax preparer. \nApplicant\u2019s family lives within their means. Applicant\u2019s home has significantly increased \nin value in the past few years. He is up to date with his federal and state tax return filings. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person.

An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d).  \nAnalysis \nGUIDELINE F \u2013 Financial Considerations \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this guideline \nis that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \nrules and regulations. All of these factors can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Here, \nthe Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant had failed to \ntimely file state and federal tax returns for multiple years, failed to pay outstanding taxes \nowed, and had one delinquent account. This is sufficient to invoke financial considerations \ndisqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations, and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required \nUnder these facts, four conditions could mitigate related security concerns: \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problems from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, and \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt is a relatively recent development, his failure to \ntimely file multiple federal and state tax returns started several years ago. Unique \ncircumstances did not cause these tax and financial issues, just a \u201cmistake\u201d and a \u201clapse \nof judgment.\u201d Consequently, neither AG \u00b6 20(a) nor \u00b6 20(b) applies. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nBefore Applicant completed his March 2019 eQIP, he had begun addressing his \ntax return filing issues, initially with a lawyer, then with a qualified tax professional. In the \nprocess, he received professional legal and financial counseling. He had also begun work \naddressing his home equity line issue. He was forthcoming about the tax issues on his \nMarch 2019 eQIP and both his tax and home equity loan situation during a follow-up \ninterview in April 2019. By the time the SOR was issued on June 29, 2020, Applicant had \nfiled all belated federal and state tax returns, paid all sums owed, and had made progress \ntoward satisfying the payments due under his negotiated settlement agreement. Today, \nhe continues to make regular and timely payments toward that debt\u2019s significantly \nreduced balance. There is little more for him to do. Under these facts, Applicant\u2019s \nsuccessful, albeit belated, efforts raise AG \u00b6 20(c), AG \u00b6 20(d), and AG \u00b6 20(g). \nEven where tax and debt problems have been corrected and an applicant is \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, the administrative judge is not precluded \nfrom considering an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness in light of longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01984 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 2015). \nMoreover, the Appeal Board has long held that the failure to file tax returns suggests a \nproblem with complying with well-established government rules and systems. See e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). Furthermore, the Appeal Board has \ndetermined that the timing of corrective action is an appropriate factor to consider in \napplying AG \u00b6 20(g). See e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 17-01807 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018)). \nHere, Applicant successfully maintained a security clearance for nearly a quarter \nof a century without incident. He takes full responsibility for his failure to timely file tax \nreturns for the years at issue and for his singular delinquent debt. In so doing, he \nacknowledged that he understood the financial responsibilities related to the maintenance \nof a security clearance. He showed, however, that he self-identified his tax issues when \nhe completed his eQIP, he displayed candor and contrition in discussing both his tax-\nrelated corrective action and mounting debt issue during his investigative interview. He \nsuccessfully had addressed all these issues before the SOR was issued. \nFinally, in reversing favorable clearance grants to applicants with tax issues by \nDOHA judges in ISCR Case No. 17-01382 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018) and ISCR Case No. \n16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018), the Appeal Board noted that applicants who only \nbegin to address their delinquent tax returns after having been placed on notice that their \nclearance may be in jeopardy may not comply with laws, rules, and regulations when their \nimmediate interests are not imperiled. This case law is considered here and incorporated \nin my whole-person analysis, below. \nHere, this process was not what motivated Applicant to address his financial \nissues. The documentary evidence indicates that he was already addressing his then \nexistent issues before he even completed his eQIP. He discussed his growing home \nequity loan issue with the investigator shortly thereafter. Under all these unique facts and \ncircumstances, I find that the security concerns raised are mitigated. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors with regard to \nthis case and this Applicant. \nIn addition, I am mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of \nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense \njudgment based on careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nMy Guideline F analysis is incorporated in this whole-person analysis. Some factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). This Applicant successfully \nmaintained a security clearance without adverse incident for nearly 25 years. There is no \nevidence and no suggestion he has ever had any finance or tax-related issues in the past. \nApplicant\u2019s situation is not in keeping with the rest of his past conduct. He is a \nhighly respected and well-rated employee. He takes full responsibility for his issues, \nattributing them to mistake, a judgment lapse, and poor communication with his spouse. \nApplicant, however, successfully undertook corrective action and received appropriate \ncounseling \u2013 legal and financial \u2013 regarding his taxes before this process was fully \ncommenced. He kept investigators advised regarding his home equity loan situation as it \narose. \nSince that time, Applicant has been completely candid about both his situation and \nthe actions he has been taking. By the time the SOR was issued, all tax returns at issue \nhad been filed and any tax sum balances paid, and his singular delinquent account was \nin regular repayment with its balance substantially reduced. I have no doubts or \nreservations regarding Applicant\u2019s continued success in honoring his debt and using paid \nprofessionals to assure compliance with the tax laws going forward. I find concerns \nrelated to financial considerations are mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n      Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                                     \n \n \n \n                                    \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for \na security clearance is granted. \nArthur E. Marshall, Jr. \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",
