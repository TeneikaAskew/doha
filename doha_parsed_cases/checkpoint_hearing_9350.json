On February 10, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) enumerating security concerns arising under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline H (Drug Involvement). The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992),\nas amended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by\nthe President on December 29, 2005, which are effective for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nIn a March 6, 2009, response, Applicant admitted 12 of the 17 allegations set\nforth in the SOR and requested a hearing on the matter. DOHA assigned the case to\nme on June 18, 2009. Department Counsel and Applicant agreed to a hearing date of\nJuly 14, 2009. A notice of hearing was issued to that effect on June 24, 2009. I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Applicant gave testimony and offered nine\ndocuments. Department Counsel objected to Applicant\u2019s first proffered document. That\ndocument was a personal statement by a third party. It was initially excluded for its\nSeptember 30, 2009\n\n Integral excerpts from that exhibit, a statement by Applicant\u2019s ex-husband, were repeatedly referenced\n      1\nby the parties during the hearing. Consequently, I have admitted the document as Exhibit U and given it\nappropriate weight in view of Department Counsel\u2019s objection.\n This date was chosen to provide Applicant with additional time to submit her first bankruptcy payment,\n      2\nscheduled for July 15, 2009. Tr. 47.\n Post-hearing submission items 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11; item 10 is an academic \u201cTo whom it may\n      3\nconcern\u201d letter of recommendation depicted by Department Counsel as an unsigned witness statement.\n The exceptions to this are copies of correspondence from Department Counsel concerning her receipt\n      4\nof Applicant\u2019s earlier submission and her objections to many of the documents contained therein.\n2\nrepresentation of corroborating testimony regarding which the writer was unavailable for\ncross-examination.  The remaining documents were admitted as exhibits (Exs.) A-H.\n1\nApplicant was given through July 28, 2009, to submit any additional documentation.2\nDepartment Counsel offered eight documents, admitted as exhibits (Exs.) 1-8 without\nobjection. On July 15, 2009, Applicant submitted 12 documents through Department\nCounsel. The transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received on July 22, 2009. In\nforwarding Applicant\u2019s package on July 28, 2009, Department Counsel objected to eight\nof Applicant\u2019s documents. She cited to relevance, incompleteness, and the authenticity\nof an unsigned witness statement. After due consideration, all the documents were\nultimately accepted into the record and marked as Exs. I-T, with Department Counsel\u2019s\nobjections duly noted.  Those documents admitted against the objection of Department\n3\nCounsel were given appropriate weight in light of the objections argued. The record was\nclosed on July 29, 2009. \nOn August 2, 2009, Applicant transmitted to Department Counsel a 39-page\npackage containing 14 additional documents. Department Counsel moved to object to\ntheir inclusion as untimely. The newly offered documents included responses to\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s objections to Applicant\u2019s previous submissions. Inasmuch as\nthose previous submissions were admitted against Department Counsel\u2019s objections,\nthat issue is moot. The remainder of the documents pre-date Applicant\u2019s deadline for\nsubmitting post-hearing information by anywhere from a month to several years.  Good\n4\ncause was neither shown nor offered as to why they were not included in her original\nsubmission or some time prior to the closing of the record. Consequently, Department\nCounsel\u2019s objection motion regarding the August 2, 2009, submissions is sustained. \nBased on a review of the testimony, submissions, and exhibits, I find Applicant\nfailed to meet her burden regarding the financial considerations security concerns\nraised. Security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 45-year-old owner of a government contracting company. She has\nbeen an owner for the past three years. Her projects currently do not require a security\nclearance. She believes she can contribute to the defense contracting industry and\nhopes a security clearance will help make her business more lucrative.

Applicant is respected in her\ncommunity.5\nSince about 2005, Applicant has suffered a series of strokes, sometimes\ndiagnosed under the older term of \u201ccerebral vascular accident.\u201d  Her 2005 stroke led to\n6\na period of recuperation and rehabilitation lasting an unspecified number of months.\nDuring this period, she could not work.  Another stroke occurred after a brief return to\n7\nthe workplace. As a result, she lost her job and was forced to seek aid from Social\nSecurity. This entailed a five month waiting period, during which Applicant had no\nincome.  She was only able to subsist through financial assistance from her mother.\n8\n9\nApplicant has also suffered from intervening transient ischemic attacks (TIA), mini-\nstrokes often heralding the advent of a full stroke which can affect speech and\nunderstanding. These have also disrupted her ability to work and generate a salary.  It\n10\nis not uncommon for strokes to cause various degrees of memory loss.  \n11\nApplicant was examined for a possible stroke in 2007.  In addition, she was\n12\nunder a doctor\u2019s care for either a more recent incident or a follow-up as of at least\nAugust 2008. In the interim, Applicant completed the June 20, 2008, SF-86 at issue. At\nthat time, she was being prescribed several medications, including Valium and Paxil.\nAfter her August 2008 doctor\u2019s appointment, Applicant\u2019s doctor wrote that her speech\nand walk had been affected by her medical condition. The doctor also noted that\nApplicant was currently unable to maintain gainful employment and would need help\nwith housing and medication.  As a result, Applicant was determined to be medically\n13\ndisabled. In October 2008, Applicant became eligible for Medicare, which has since\nhelped pay for her medical needs.  \n14\nOver the past few years, Applicant has been prescribed other medications, each\nwith varying side effects. At times she has been prescribed opioids related to pain\n\n Id., at 9, 11, and 15.\n      15\n See, e.g., Tr. 18, 20, 44-46, 49-50, 52-54, 56-60, 72-73, 81, 102. \u201cMy dates may be off. . . .

Applicant did not disagree with Department Counsel\u2019s observation that \u201c[Applicant\u2019s]\ntestimony has been inconsistent and all over the map as to what was happening and what the dates were for\neverything.\u201d Tr. 78-79.\n Id.\n      17\n Tr. 112.\n      18\n Tr. 119.\n      19\n Applicant misidentified the year as 2003. Tr. 83.\n      20\n4\nmanagement.  Although she claims her \u201cmind is never distorted\u201d with regard to her\n15\nability to run her business, she testified that she has difficulty with dates.  This difficulty\n16\nalso was shown to have affected her memory with regard to significant professional and\npersonal events.  The financial repercussions of her recent medical history have been\n17\nextensive. The medical bills noted in the SOR do not reflect the full extent of her\nmedical costs or liability. Noting the relatively modest amount of medical debt at issue,\nDepartment Counsel asked whether she had already paid off a significant amount of\nher medical debt. Applicant stated: \u201cNo. I\u2019m just getting started.\u201d  \n18\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties first occurred in 1995, the year her health first\nbegan to decline. That year, she wrote several checks of nominal value to local\nmerchants. Before they were cashed, her ex-husband, whom she had divorced in 1993,\nbut still maintained some contact despite their abusive relationship, used her bank card\nto withdraw funds from her account without her knowledge. Consequently, there were\ninsufficient funds to cover her checks. As a result, she was charged in February 1995\nand April 1995 on multiple accounts of Negotiating Worthless Instruments (Checks).\nSOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b. On both occasions, she pled guilty to all charges and was\nsentenced to 10 days suspended work release and 9 months of probation. \nIn about August 2003, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. SOR\nallegation \u00b6 1.c. She did so after receiving financial counseling.  Some of the debt\n19\nconsisted of obligations dating back to her first marriage. Applicant does not recollect\nan approximate amount of the debt at issue. Her debt was discharged in 2004.20\nCurrently at issue are the following delinquent debts, as cited in credit reports\nfrom December 29, 2008, and June 27, 2008, and noted in the SOR as:\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.e (medical providers, $1,050) \u2013 UNPAID \u2013 As discussed below, Applicant has\nbeen unable to pay any of these delinquent debts.\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.i, i.j (medical entity, $316) \u2013 UNPAID \u2013 As discussed below, Applicant has\nbeen unable to pay any of these delinquent debts.\n\n Ex. P (Partial Credit Report 15/30) at 2. The report shows the current balance as $1,229.\n      21\n Tr. 84-86. Applicant did, however, submit evidence that this debt may be a medical account, not a credit\n      22\ncard account, as noted in the credit report. Ex. M (Partial Credit Report).\n Tr. 85, 87.\n      23\n Tr. 87.\n      24\n Tr. 86-87.\n      25\n Tr. 85, 87.\n      26\n Tr. 98.\n      27\n Tr. 99-100; Ex. N (Automobile Repossession Materials). Elsewhere in the record, Applicant stated she\n      28\nvacated the house in July 2004. Tr. 111.\n5\n\u00b6 1.g (credit card account, $1,339) \u2013 DISPUTED \u2013 This debt was incurred by one of\nApplicant\u2019s two ex-husbands. It originally had a balance of $500, but it increased due to\ninterest fees. She initially disputed this debt with a credit reporting agency. She\nprovided evidence that the account was disputed.  She subsequently negotiated a\n21\nsettlement on the account for $250. She stated that she paid this amount and had\nevidence of payment, but no proof of payment was ultimately submitted.  She initially\n22\nargued that this account is the same as \u00b6 1.k, but provided no evidence to that effect.23\n\u00b6 1.h (credit card, $1,092) \u2013 UNPAID \u2013 Applicant stated that an ex-husband incurred\nthe balance on this card on the condition he pay her back for his purchases.  When he\n24\nfailed to repay her the balance, she denied the debt was hers to investigators. She\nultimately took responsibility for the debt and negotiated a settlement on this account\nfor $500. No evidence of payment, however, was provided.  \n25\n\u00b6 1.k (Collection for bank, $981) \u2013 UNPAID \u2013 Applicant claims this account is the same\nas the account cited at \u00b6 1.g, above, but provided no evidence linking the two\naccounts.  She previously submitted a copy of an offer to settle the debt with the\n26\ncollection entity, but included no documentary evidence that the settlement offer was\naccepted and paid.\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o (medical collections, $365) \u2013 UNPAID \u2013 As discussed below,\nApplicant has been unable to pay any of these delinquent debts.\n\u00b6 1.p (automobile account, $12,548) \u2013 UNPAID \u2013 This account concerns a voluntary\nrepossession. She called the lender to have the car collected after she was one month\nbehind in her payments. She knew she would not be able to make future payments.\nThe company did not collect the car for an additional month or two. It charged her for\nthe entire period the car remained within Applicant\u2019s control.  Applicant provided\n27\ncorrespondence regarding an offer by the creditor to settle for 30% of the balance,\nreducing her debt to $3,7887.79. Applicant concedes, however, that she has not paid\nanything toward that balance or toward an alleged counteroffer she proposed to pay\n$500 for the late payments.   \n28\n\n Ex.

She states that she sold the house at issue in June or\nJuly of 2005, prior to a foreclosure action commenced in about February 2006.  She\n29\nprovided no evidence, however, of the alleged sale or deed transfer. Her March 2008\ncredit report shows a zero balance owed, but notes that the account remains 120 days\npast due.  Her documents also show a mortgage with a different company as having\n30\nbeen late and transferred.  A more recent credit report shows an additional mortgage\n31\nentry with the same date of opening, high credit, and $756 balance with the notation\n\u201cAccount transferred or sold.\u201d She claims this latter entry reflects her mortgage on the\nhome at issue.  She failed to provide evidence, however, linking her with the latter\n32\nmortgage company or showing that the conflicting entry was either transferred from her\nname or otherwise belongs to a third party.     \nApplicant seeks to work in some capacity to keep active and to cover both her\ndebts and current expenses. She does not currently have credit cards, nor does she\nhave a car loan. Her savings are depleted and her checking account is overdrawn.33\nOther than the $250 she testified she paid toward SOR allegation \u00b6 1.g, Applicant has\nbeen unable to make any payments toward any of the debts at issue \u201cbecause . . . I\nmake a month what I usually [made] the first three days of a work week.\u201d  \n34\nApplicant lives alone with her pets. A friend checks on her occasionally and\nperforms various chores, for which Applicant pays him a nominal sum plus his\ntransportation. She currently receives approximately $1,234 a month, from which $96 is\npaid to Medicare, $435 is expended on prescriptions, $550 is spent on rent,\ntelephone/internet cost about $70 month, while utilities run from $275-$300 a month.35\nThis does not include groceries, toiletries, or sundry items.  Her annual income is\n36\ncurrently supplemented by approximately $450 from her work through her company.\nShe is currently seeking federal housing assistance under the Section 8 program.  She\n37\nreceives some assistance from local churches, organizations, and the community \u201cfood\n\n Tr. 118-119.\n      38\n Tr. 118.\n      39\n Tr. 120.\n      40\n Ex. 1 (SF-86 dated Jun. 20, 2008).\n      41\n Ex. 2 (Interrogatories, dated Dec. 1, 2008).\n      42\n Tr. 43, 45.\n      43\n See, e.g., Tr. 46, 107.\n      44\n See, e.g., Tr. 131-132.\n      45\n See, e.g., Tr.20, 44-46, 49-50, 52-54.\n      46\n7\nline.\u201d  Applicant admits her expenses exceed her income \u201csignificantly.\u201d  Her past\n38\n39\nfinancial counseling has not been able to help her with her current situation.40\nAside from Applicant\u2019s financial situation, an additional issue remains. The SOR\nalso alleges (\u00b6 2.a) Applicant used marijuana on one occasion in December 2006, after\nbeing granted a security clearance in June 2004. That allegation is based on the\nanswer Applicant provided on her June 2008 SF-86.  After submitting her June 2008\n41\nSF-86, an investigation followed. In response to follow-up questions in a December\n2008 interrogatory, Applicant wrote that the incident occurred in December 1986.  She\n42\nstated she was reminded by her first husband that it occurred around Christmas 1986,\na week after their marriage.  Other evidence indicates that the incident took place in\n43\nDecember 1996, around the time she married her second husband in 1996.  Despite\n44\nconsiderable testimony, the date remains unresolved. \nApplicant is adamant that she recalls the incident occurred around Christmas\nand closely after a marriage, thus making the year 1986 or 1996. Applicant succumbed\nout of momentary despair from personal events in her life, although varying issues in\nher life were existent in the December of all three of the years referenced.  She only\n45\nused marijuana once and has no intention of using it again. It was an isolated incident\nof which Applicant has little recollection and of which she is contrite. Regardless, she\nmaintains that the year of 2006 noted on her SF-86 is incorrect and noted accidently.  \n46\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.\nThe administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      47\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n      48\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      49\n Id.\n      50\n Id.\n      51\n8\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in\nthe SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n47\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n48\n49\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n50\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.51\nBased \nupon \nconsideration \nof \nthe \nevidence, \nGuideline \nF \n(Financial\nConsiderations) and  Guideline H (Drug Involvement) are the most pertinent to this\ncase. Conditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security\n\n AG \u00b6 18.\n      52\n Regarding SOR allegation \u00b6 1.g.\n      53\n9\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate such\nconcerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or an\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.52\nThe Directive sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline. \nBetween 2005 and 2008, Applicant acquired significant debt which became\ndelinquent. Therefore, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6\n19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and FC DC AG \u00b6 9(c) (\u201ca history of\nnot meeting financial obligations\u201d) apply. With such conditions raised, the burden shifts\nto Applicant to overcome the case against her and mitigate security concerns. \nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s 1995 convictions for Negotiating Worthless\nInstruments (Checks) and her 2003 bankruptcy, these events pre-date her current\nmedical and financial problems. They are also events of the past, attributable in part to\nan abusive ex-husband who is no longer a part of her life. Consequently, FC MC AG\n\u00b620(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) applies. \nMost of Applicant\u2019s current debts are related to either her health problems, the\nfinancial repercussions of her health problems, or her related periods of unemployment.\nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that\nresulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) applies. \nApplicant received financial counseling shortly before her bankruptcy filing in\n2003. She concedes that it has been of little help in sorting out her current financial\nissues. There is no evidence Applicant has attempted to employ an organized strategy\nin approaching her debt. Although it is notable that her lack of progress is more\nattributable to an inability to pay, rather than a refusal to pay, FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d) does not apply.\nMoreover, according to Applicant\u2019s own testimony, she has only made an attempt to\nmake one $250 payment to one creditor.  She failed, however, to provide evidence\n53\nthat such a good-faith effort was made. Additionally, Applicant showed that any\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 24.\n      54\n Id. at \u00b6 24(a)(1-2).\n      55\n Id. at 24(b).\n      56\n10\nprogress at this time or in the near future is nearly impossible, given her limited current\nincome and her essential expenses. Consequently, FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d) does\nnot apply. No other mitigating conditions apply.\nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation is relatively dire. Her expenses\n\u201csignificantly\u201d exceed her income. She is currently reliant on community and familial\nassistance. Her current workload does not include defense-related projects. It only\ngenerates about $450 per year, although there is no indication of any obstacles\nblocking her ability to generate more work outside the defense industry. She received\nfinancial counseling, but her current financial situation is presently so overwhelming, it\nis beyond the knowledge that counseling imparted. There is no proposed plan or outline\nin place for addressing her delinquent debts in the near future. No progress has been\nmade on even the most nominal debts at issue. There is no evidence Applicant has\nmaintained any on-going contact with her creditors. Consequently, Applicant failed to\nprovide evidence to fully mitigate financial considerations security concerns. \nGuideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations.  \u201cDrugs\u201d are defined as mood and behavior altering substances,\n54\nand include drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the\nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended, (e.g., marijuana or cannabis,\ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens) and inhalants and other\nsubstances.  \u201cDrug abuse\u201d is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\n55\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.  \n56\nSOR allegation \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant not only used marijuana one time in\nabout December 26, 2006, but that she did so after being granted a security clearance\nin June 2004. Applicant admits using marijuana once. Although she originally noted it\nwas used in 2006, her ex-husband prompted her memory to suggest it was in 1986.\nToday, her memory vacillates between the incident occurring in December 1986 or\nDecember 1996, both of which preceded her security clearance. The evidence supports\nthe fact she has had repeated strokes. Such attacks are known to affect memory.\nApplicant testified that she has difficulty with dates concerning a variety of events. She\nalso has been on medications that may affect memory. Her vacillation between dates\nmight otherwise be suspect except for the fact she demonstrated an equally poor\nmemory with regard to incidents in her life unrelated to the issues and are personally far\nmore significant than a one-time use of marijuana. Given this consistent and credible\ndemonstration of confusion regarding a variety of dates, her recent medical history, and\n\n Indeed, given the singularity of the incident during a time of personal depression, her subsequent drug-\n      57\nfree lifestyle, and her intent to never partake of the substance again, this same DI MC could well apply had\nit occurred three years ago in 2006.\n11\nher insistence the event occurred shortly after a marriage, the evidence does not\nsupport the allegation that Applicant used marijuana in 2006, when she possessed a\nsecurity clearance.\nThis does not, however, absolve Applicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana. At most, it\nonly makes inapplicable Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) AG \u00b6 25(g)\n(\u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance\u201d. DI DC AG \u00b6 25(a) (\u201cany\ndrug abuse\u201d) remains applicable. \nApplicant freely volunteered her one-time abuse of marijuana, demonstrated her\ncontrition, and stated she would not again lapse. She explained that the incident\noccurred during a holiday time when she felt down or distraught. Whether the singular\nincident occurred in 1986 or 1996, Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC) AG \u00b6\n26(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) applies.  Given the fact her\n57\nillegal drug use is comprised of one incident in the life of a 45-year-old woman, 23\nyears, 13 years, or even 3 years would comprise an appropriate period of abstinence.\nTherefore, DI MC AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) (\u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the\nfuture such as: an appropriate period of abstinence\u201d) also applies. Consequently,\nregardless of when the drug abuse occurred, these facts, Applicant\u2019s subsequent\nabstinence, and the amount of time that has passed since the incident all contribute to\nmitigating this security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and the whole person concept. \n\n12\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Speaking in Applicant\u2019s favor, she is a mature, educated, and respected\nbusinesswoman who has made significant physical improvement since suffering a\nseries of strokes. She is not content staying idle while classified as a person with a\nmedical disability. She is intelligent and has an evident entrepreneurial spirit. But for her\nrecent health problems, there is no indication that her post-bankruptcy finances would\nhave once again led her into significant debt. As for her present debt, she is not\nunwilling to honor her obligations, but simply unable to do so.\nSpeaking against Applicant, however, is the fact that her delinquent debt remains\nessentially unaddressed. Medical bills of less than $100 remain unpaid alongside bills\nof higher amounts, with no effort exerted to address them. Granted, Applicant presently\nhas no resources and her expenditures significantly exceed her income. There is no\nsuggestion, however, that Applicant has approached an attorney or credit counselor\nregarding alternative approaches toward handling her debt. She articulated no plan or\nstrategy for addressing her obligations, only the hopes that defense contracting work\nmight help increase her income. As presented, Applicant\u2019s history and current financial\nsituation may mitigate the creation of her debt, but they do not mitigate the security\nconcerns regarding their current status or her failure to make some effort toward their\nresolution. Given Applicant\u2019s presentation, she failed to mitigate financial considerations\nsecurity concerns.\nRegarding past drug involvement, Applicant, through her testimony and\npresentation, demonstrated that she has difficulty with dates. Whether this is an innate\nproblem or one resulting from her health issues cannot be determined and is irrelevant.\nThis difficulty extends beyond the issue of precisely when she used marijuana on one\nsingular occasion and extends to other incidents from her past. Regardless, sufficient\ntime has passed since she used marijuana under any of the time lines referenced, she\ndemonstrated contrition, and expressed her intent not to use drugs again. Additionally,\nshe raised other mitigating conditions that are applicable under the circumstances.\nConsequently, drug involvement security concerns are mitigated.\nAs noted above, any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be\nallowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information. With security concerns regarding her finances unmitigated, I\nconclude it is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security\nclearance. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n13\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\nARTHUR E.

On December 23, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued to Applicant, a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn February 17, 2010, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on June 11, \n2010. The case was assigned to me on June 24, 2010. On July 19, 2010, a Notice of \nHearing was issued scheduling the hearing for August 10, 2010. The hearing was held, \nas scheduled. The Government offered nine exhibits which were admitted as \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 9 without objection. Applicant testified and called one \nwitness. Applicant offered one exhibit which was admitted as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A \nwithout objection. The record was left open until September 1, 2010 to allow Applicant \nSeptember 20, 2010\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n2\nto submit additional documents. He timely submitted a seven-page document which \nwas marked and admitted as AE B. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AE B is marked \nas HE I. The transcript was received on August 20, 2010. Based upon a review of the \ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to all of the allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking to maintain a security clearance.  He is a test engineer and has worked for his \ncurrent employer for 21 years. He has held a security clearance since 1991. In 2003, he \nwas denied access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), but his security \nclearance was not revoked. He is divorced. He lives with and has been in a committed \nrelationship with a woman for 14 years. His girlfriend has three adult children.

(Tr.  \n4-7, 47-48, 72-73; Gov 1; Gov 6 at 2; AE B)   \n \nApplicant started drinking alcohol when he was twelve years old. His parents \nwould occasionally give him an alcoholic beverage during special occasions. He first \nbecame intoxicated at age 16 while in high school. His alcohol use increased in college. \nHe initially flunked out of college. (Tr. 26; Gov 3 at 12; Gov 4 at 6; Gov 5 at 13-14) \n \nIn December 1990, Applicant was arrested and charged with Operating While \nIntoxicated (OWI) and cited for Speeding. He received a deferred sentence, was \nordered to pay a fine, complete community service and attend an alcohol awareness \ncourse.  One of the terms of his probation included abstaining from alcohol. (Tr. 32; Gov \n3 at 9; Gov 5 at 14-15, 141; Gov 6 at 3; Gov 7 at 4)  \n \nIn June 1991, Applicant was arrested for Public Intoxication. He spent the night in \njail and was fined. He did not report this offense to his probation officer. He was found to \nbe in violation of his probation related to his prior arrest. The judge ordered his deferred \njudgment revoked and he was ordered to serve five days in the county jail. (Tr. 32-35; \nGov 5 at 15, 130, 133-134)  \n \nIn October 1991, Applicant was arrested and charged with OWI, Second \nOffense. He was found guilty. His sentence included a $750 fine, two years probation, \nand he was ordered to attend alcohol evaluation and counseling. (Tr. 37-38; Gov 3 at 9-\n10; Gov 5 at 15, 124-126; Gov 6 at 3; Gov 7 at 4) \n \nIn July 1992, Applicant underwent a substance abuse evaluation. He was \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser by a chemical dependency counselor. The chemical \ndependency counselor was not a licensed clinical social worker. (Gov 5 at 123) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n3\nOn March 15, 1993, Applicant underwent a chemical dependency evaluation at a \ntreatment center as one of the conditions of his supervised probation related to his \nsecond OWI conviction. The Clinical Supervisor determined that \u201calcohol abuse is \ncertainly evident but presently there does not appear to be sufficient available data to \nsubstantiate a diagnostic impression of alcohol dependency.\u201d (Gov 5 at 194) Applicant \nwas advised to abstain from alcohol and/any or all mood altering substances except as \nprescribed by a physician. (Tr. 93; Gov 5 at 190-196) \n \nFrom April 15, 1994 to May 31, 1994, Applicant attended out-patient counseling \nat a Substance Abuse Council as part of his probation related to his October 1991 OWI \nconviction. (He chose to attend out-patient counseling here because it was less \nexpensive than the two other facilities where he sought evaluations.) Applicant told the \ncounselors that he remained totally abstinent from alcohol since his October 1991 \narrest. He had no plans to use alcohol in the future. His score on the Michigan \nAlcoholism Screening Test (MAST) placed him in a category for moderate alcoholism. \nUpon completion of the program, Applicant was advised to remain abstinent from \nalcohol, to seek additional outpatient counseling on relapse issues, and to attend \nAlcoholic Anonymous (AA), Alanon, and Adult Children of Alcoholics meetings. (Tr. 39-\n40; Gov 5 at 71-72) It does not appear the counselors in this program were licensed \nclinical social workers. (See Gov 5 at 71-72) \n \nOn August 7, 1996, Applicant provided a signed, sworn statement to a \nDepartment of Defense investigator conducting his background investigation.  Applicant \ndiscussed his past alcohol offenses and his alcohol counseling. Regarding his current \nlevel of use, Applicant stated the following: \n \nI currently drink about two drinks, usually wine, every six months. I \nacknowledge that [the treatment facility] recommended that I abstain from \nalcohol completely and that I agreed to do so, but I feel I can control my \ndrinking and subsequent actions. It is my intention to keep my \nconsumption of alcohol at a moderate level. \n \n(Gov 9 at 3)  \n \nThe Department of Defense investigator subsequently interviewed several \nreferences who were on a bowling team with Applicant. Several of the references \nindicated Applicant drank beer on his bowling nights. The references indicated Applicant \ndrank between three to six beers a week between August 1994 to April 1996. The \ninvestigator interviewed Applicant for a second time on August 8, 1996, to ask him \nabout the conflicting information about his alcohol use. (See Gov 3 at 11) \n \nOn August 8, 1996, Applicant provided a signed, sworn statement to the \ninvestigator. Applicant stated: \n \nIn my previous statement I said that I currently drink about two glasses of \nwine every six months. This was a false statement. I have been \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n4\nconsuming about six beers or alcoholic drinks weekly, on average since \nAUG 94. Since then I have been intoxicated about three times, the last \nbeing around JUN or JUL 96. On that occasion I had about three to four \nbeers. The prior two times were in the period from AUG 94 to APR 95 and \nagain in the Summer of 95. The amount consumed was roughly the same \nas in JUN or JUL 95. \n \nI now state that I intend to minimize my use of alcohol or stop it altogether. \n \nI acknowledge lying to [the investigator] in my 16 JUL 96 and 06 AUG 96 \ninterviews when I discussed my use of alcohol. I did this due to frustration \non my part in my job. Without the security clearance I feel more pressure \nto do my work because of restrictions placed on my movements and \naccess to materials necessary to do my job. Consequently, I lied so as to \nnot complicate my investigation any more than it already was. This was a \nmistake. [The investigator] has pointed out that I now have to contend with \nthe issue of my honesty as well as my use of alcohol. I want to state \nunequivocally and in full knowledge of punitive provisions of the United \nStates Code Title 18, Section 1010 that I am being fully truthful in this \nstatement. I admit lying under oath, for the reason set forth above, on my \nfirst statement. \n \n[The investigator] has pointed out that the record from ASAC states that in \nMAR 94 I intended to stop drinking forever. He has also noted that I was \ndrinking again in AUG of that year. He has asked if I lied to the counselor \nat ASAC in order to speed up the end of that program. I admit that this \nwas my intention and that while I may have had no specific plans at that \ntime to resume drinking, neither was it my intention to forever abstain from \nalcohol as I had told my counselor. By AUG 94 I thought I could handle \nthe alcohol. It is in this context only that I have ever lied to any counselor \nor probation officer.  \n \nGov 8 at 1.  \n \n \nApplicant also admits to giving conflicting information to an investigator \nconducting a background investigation for another government agency about his current \nuse of alcohol during interviews on May 8, 2002, and January 28, 2003. (Answer to \nSOR) On May 8, 2002, Applicant told another government agency\u2019s security \nrepresentative that he drinks a total of six beers sporadically throughout the month, \ndrinking more in the summer months. On January 28, 2003, Applicant was interviewed \nby a representative of the other government agency\u2019s psychological services. During \nthe interview, he told the representative that he currently drinks one or two beers \napproximately every other day. Applicant was advised by the psychological services \nrepresentative to abstain from alcohol use, and that if his use of alcohol remains \nunchanged, he is at moderate risk for another alcohol-related incident. (Gov 3)  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n5\n \nOn July 17, 2003, the other government agency denied Applicant access to \nSensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) because of his excessive alcohol \nconsumption, and his false oral and written statements to government representatives \nduring his prior and current background investigations in order to hide his alcohol \nconsumption. The other government agency concluded:  \n \n[Applicant] has acknowledged that he deliberately lied to [security] \nrepresentatives and provided false signed/sworn statements during his \nSSBIs concerning his alcohol consumption. He has also intentionally lied \nto medical professionals, providing them information he knew they wanted \nto hear in order to end counseling and to satisfy the requirements of the \ncourt. In addition, he provided the other government agency\u2019s security and \npsychological services representatives with conflicting information \nconcerning his current consumption of alcohol. \n \n(Gov 3 at 11) \n \nIn February 2005, Applicant voluntarily sought alcohol counseling through his \nemployer\u2019s Employee Assistance Program. (Tr. 50-52; Gov 4 at 10; Gov 6 at 8) Prior to \nhis seeking assistance, his girlfriend expressed concern about his excessive drinking \nbehavior. Applicant had several excessive drinking bouts. On two occasions, he \nexperienced black outs. One time he fell off a bar stool. When he woke up, he was in an \nambulance on the way to the hospital. On another occasion, Applicant was walking from \nhis car to his house and fell on his face in the driveway. He suffered abrasions to his \nface. (Tr. 51-55; Gov 3 at 10-14) \n \nFrom September 5, 2006, to November 11, 2006, Applicant attended an \nintensive outpatient program for alcohol treatment at a local hospital, after being \nreferred by the Employee Assistance Program. The treatment notes indicate Appellant \ndeveloped severe problems with his significant other and family members because of \nhis drinking alcohol in binges and falling down while drunk. During his treatment, \nApplicant received an assessment of alcohol abuse; tobacco abuse; and hypertension. \nUpon his completion of the program, it was recommended that Applicant attend AA \nmeetings, seek direction from an AA sponsor, attend aftercare, and continue to develop \na chemically free lifestyle.  (Tr. 56-59; Gov 4 at 3-8)  \n \nOn November 7, 2007, Applicant was interviewed as part of his periodic \nbackground investigation. During the interview, Applicant discussed his alcohol \nbackground. He indicated that he intended to continue drinking alcohol, in moderation, \nonly while socializing and only on special occasions. (Gov 6 at 7) On January 2, 2008, \nApplicant was re-interviewed as part of his periodic background investigation. During \nthe interview, he indicated that he intended to abstain from alcohol use. (Gov 6 at 3) On \nDecember 23, 2008, Applicant answered interrogatories about his alcohol use. In \nresponse to the question, \u201cOn what date did you last consume alcohol?\u201d he responded, \n\u201cDecember 15, 2008.\u201d When asked about the frequency of his alcohol use, Applicant \nwrote, \u201cWeekly to Monthly, 12-24 oz.\u201d (Gov 7 at 2)  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n6\nOn February 2, 2010, Applicant underwent a comprehensive evaluation by Dr. \nB., a licensed psychologist with substance abuse professional credentials. Dr. B. claims \nthat his assessment was used to determine, \u201c\u2026whether there is a maladaptive pattern \nof alcohol use, causing clinically significant impairment or distress\u2026\u201d (AE 1 at 1) Dr. B. \nstates that under the DSM-IV, Alcohol Abuse disorder has to be determined that in the \npast 12 months this individual\u2019s drinking has repeatedly caused or contributed to, risk of \nbodily harm, relationship trouble, role failure, or run-ins with the law. If one or more of \nthese is \u201cyes,\u201d then the individual is abusing alcohol. Testing found no problem in any \ncategory. (AE A) \n \nDr. B. states to determine Alcohol Dependence Disorder it has to be determined \nin the past 12 months that the individual has not been able to stick to drinking limits, not \nbeen able to cut down or stop, shown tolerance, shown signs of withdrawal, kept \ndrinking despite physical and psychological problems, spent a lot of time anticipating or \nrecovering from drinking, and spent less time on other activities that are important or \npleasurable. If three or more of these answers answered \u201cyes\u201d then the individual has \nalcohol dependence. Testing confirmed no current diagnosis of dependence in the three \nor more categories for any given substance in the previous year. (AE A) \n \nDr. B. indicated, \u201c[Applicant] reports he has resolved the issue of being able to \nenjoy even a lone social beverage. This creates all kinds of problems for treatment \ncounselors and others who have insisted on complete abstinence. It is a hot wire \n[Applicant] no longer wishes to assume he can touch. He doesn\u2019t need it or want it.\u201d  \n(AE A at 3) The report does not indicate whether Applicant provided information on his \ncurrent consumption of alcohol or whether he told Dr. B. that he was no longer drinking. \nThe report concludes, \u201c[Applicant] will continue his affiliation with Alcoholics \nAnonymous. There are no further recommendations for clinical addiction treatment \nservices.\u201d (AE A)  \n \nIn his response to the SOR, dated February 17, 2010, Applicant made the \nfollowing comments about his alcohol use: \n \nI have been abstaining from alcohol consumption for almost two months \nas I write this and I plan to continue. I have been living with the same \nperson now for 14 years and have helped raise her family. They are all \ngrown now and have been successful in their endeavors. Since my \noutpatient program completion until nearly two months ago I had only \nconsumed alcohol on occasion, eating out somewhere or when a friend \nhas come over, but not to the point of intoxication. I had planned on \nabstaining as I stated in the previous interrogatory but I wasn\u2019t having any \nproblem with an occasional drink. I now feel that it is pointless to even \nhave an occasional drink and so I am now not using alcohol at all.  \n \nI entered outpatient treatment under my own volition and have been \nattending Alcoholic\u2019s Anonymous on a regular basis. My drinking in the \npast has never affected my ability to do my job or impaired my abilities to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n7\nmake decisions concerning my job or security matters. In fact, I have \nhelped others when questions have arose as to how to handle certain \nsecurity situations and I have always been thorough to follow guidelines \nand proper procedures when handling security situations.  \n \nResponse to SOR, dated February 17, 2010, at 2.  \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant admitted that prior to his outpatient treatment in \n2006, he had an attitude of \u201cwanting to party until he dies.\u201d Since his treatment, \nApplicant believes he has grown up and has not had any issues with alcohol. He admits \nto drinking occasionally but not to intoxication. When he drinks alcohol, he has a couple \ndrinks when he goes out to dinner. The last time he drank alcohol was a couple of \nweeks ago. He considers himself to have an alcohol problem, but believes his drinking \nis under control. He occasionally attends AA meetings. He has never attended AA on a \nregular basis and has never obtained a sponsor.  He is not working a 12-step program. \n(Tr. 25-26, 68-70)  \n \nUpon further questioning, Applicant described his current level of alcohol use as: \n  \nApplicant: Currently, I had a period of abstinence from January until like \nthe end of April and have consumed since then a couple times when going \nout for dinner and occasionally on the weekend when we go to our cabin.\u201d  \n \nJudge: And how much do you drink, beer, wine\u2014 \n \nApplicant: I just drink beer. \n \nJudge: And how many beers would you drink? \n \nApplicant: On a weekend from like Friday through Saturday or whatever, \nI\u2019d have five or six over the course of the day.  \n \n(Tr. 71)  \n \nApplicant admits that his girlfriend still occasionally gets upset with him when he \nis drinking alcohol. She got upset a couple of weeks prior to the hearing about his \nalcohol use. She told him to quit drinking. (Tr. 72)  \n  \nWhole-Person Factors \n \nA security specialist/facility security officer from Applicant\u2019s company testified on \nApplicant\u2019s behalf. She indicated Applicant\u2019s behavior at work is good and he has no \nsecurity violations. She is aware of the allegations in the SOR. Based on her interaction \nwith Applicant, she does not see him as a security risk. She does not socialize with \nApplicant outside of work. (Tr. 77-80; AE B at 7)  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\nApplicant\u2019s mid-term review was favorable. He maintains a positive attitude and \nhandles issues in a positive manner. He works well with other team members and seeks \nchallenging work. He has excellent technical abilities. (AE B at 5-6) His mid-term review \nfor 2009 was also favorable. (Gov 5 at 4-5) \n \nApplicant provided copies of his transcripts related to his studies for his masters \nin industrial engineering for the Fall semester 2009, Spring semester 2010, and \nSummer semester 2010. He has been successful in his studies. (AE B at 2-4)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n9\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG & 21:       \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. The following Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions are relevant to \nApplicant\u2019s case: \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent) applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s three alcohol-related \narrests in December 1990, June 1991, and October 1991.  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c) (habitual or binge consumption to the point of impaired judgment, \nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent) applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s drinking history.  Applicant\u2019s excessive \nalcohol use resulted in the three arrests during his younger years in the early 1990. In \n2005, Applicant experienced blackouts as a result of consuming too much alcohol. \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of alcohol use is a concern. From to time to time, he abstains from \ndrinking alcohol. He eventually resumes drinking claiming that he occasionally has one \nor two drinks on a special occasion. During the hearing, Applicant testified that he \ncurrently consumes 5-6 six beers on a weekend day. His level of alcohol use is \nincreasing.   \n \nAG \u00b6 22(d) (diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence) and AG \u00b6 \n22(e) (evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social \nworker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program) do not apply. \nAlthough Applicant has gone through alcohol treatment on several occasions and \nreceived a diagnosis of alcohol abuse, the record is not clear that the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n10\nindividual/counselor making the diagnosis was a duly qualified medical professional or a \nlicensed clinical social worker.   \n \nAG \u00b6 22(f) (relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and \ncompletion of an alcohol rehabilitation program) applies. Applicant has received a \ndiagnosis of alcohol abuse on several occasions. After completion of outpatient \ntreatment on several occasions, Applicant expressed an intent to abstain from drinking \nalcohol, but eventually resumed drinking alcohol.  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(g) (failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence) applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s June 1991 \narrest for Public Intoxication.  Applicant was serving probation at the time and was \nrequired to maintain abstinence as a term of his probation. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from alcohol consumption. The following Alcohol Consumption \nMitigating Conditions are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a) (so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does \nnot apply. Applicant has a long history of alcohol abuse. He attempts to remain \nabstinent after each incident only to resume drinking alcohol to excess. Considering \nApplicant\u2019s past history of relapses and his past minimization of his drinking patterns, \nquestions remain about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nConsidering his past unsuccessful attempts to abstain from alcohol, a concern remains \nabout his alcohol use as well his lack of participation in a program that would help him \nremain sober and prevent relapse.   \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b) (the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of \nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and had \nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an \nalcohol abuser) does not apply. While Applicant admits that he has an alcohol problem, \nhe continues to drink alcohol even though his past alcohol use has caused problems \nwith his family and with his security clearance. He attends AA occasionally but not on a \nregular basis. He has lied to investigators and medical providers on several occasions \nabout his level of alcohol use in past security clearance investigations. Applicant\u2019s  \ncurrent claims of controlled alcohol consumption are not credible. \n \nAG \u00b6 23(d) (the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or similar \norganizations and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized \nalcohol treatment program) does not apply. About a month and half after Applicant was \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n11\nserved his SOR, he underwent a comprehensive alcohol evaluation by Dr. B, a licensed \npsychologist. While Dr. B.\u2019s evaluation was favorable, he did not testify during the \nhearing and was not subject to cross examination. It cannot be determined from the \nrecord what Applicant told Dr. B. about his alcohol consumption and the extent of his \nparticipation in AA. Would Dr. B\u2019s favorable evaluation change if he knew Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent level of alcohol consumption was approximately 5-6 beers on a weekend day? \nWould Dr. B\u2019s favorable evaluation change if he knew Applicant admitted in the past to \ntelling his counselors what they wanted to hear in order to successfully complete the \nprogram? While it does not appear that Applicant has encountered recent legal \nproblems with his alcohol use, concerns remain because of his pattern of returning to \nalcohol use after several periods of trying to abstain, his current increased level of \nconsumption, and his long history of alcohol problems.   \n \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline G.   \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in AG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \n \nThere is sufficient evidence to conclude Applicant deliberately provided false \ninformation about the level of his alcohol use in a signed, sworn statement provided to \nan investigator conducting his background investigation on August 6, 1996. Applicant \ndeliberately provided false information during interviews with security investigators of \nanother government agency on May 8, 2002, and January 28, 2003. Personal Conduct \nDisqualifying Condition AG 16(b) (deliberately providing false or misleading information \nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative) applies.   \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e) (personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing, or (2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is \nillegal in that country or that is legal in that country but illegal in the United States and \nmay serve as a basis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group) also applies. Applicant is vulnerable to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress as a result of his alcohol use. His misleading statements about \npast alcohol use reveals Applicant is aware of this vulnerability and the potential that his \nsecurity clearance may be in jeopardy as a result of his drinking.   \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n12\n \nSeveral personal conduct mitigating conditions potentially apply. They include: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts)  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); and  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress). \n \n \nI find none of the above mitigating factors apply. Applicant admits to deliberately \nproviding false information during a 1996 security clearance background investigation \nand a 2002/2003 investigation regarding SCI access. While a significant amount of time \nhas passed, in each falsification, Applicant did not admit to being untruthful until he was \nconfronted about conflicting information uncovered during each investigation. While \nthere is no proof Applicant deliberately falsified the extent of his alcohol use in the \ncurrent investigation, there is evidence that he has changed his mind on several \noccasions as to whether he intends to abstain from alcohol use. In 2003, he admitted to \ntelling medical personnel and investigators what he thought they wanted to hear \npertaining to his alcohol use. I am not fully convinced that he is being entirely truthful \nabout his alcohol use in the current investigation based upon his past history of \nuntruthfulness. As a result, he remains vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress. He has not come to terms with his alcohol issues based on his continued \nconsumption of alcohol and his lack of regular attendance at AA. In sum, Applicant \ncontinues to minimize and deny the true scope of his alcohol consumption.  \n  \n \n \nWith respect to SOR \u00b6 2.c, which alleges Applicant was denied SCI access by \nanother government agency on July 17, 2003, I find it is the consequence of Applicant\u2019s \nadmitted deliberate falsifications alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b. I find for Applicant with respect \nto the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.c. \n \n \nWith respect to SOR \u00b6 2.d. which alleges Applicant told an investigator on \nJanuary 2, 2008 that he intended to abstain from alcohol use but admitted to drinking \nalcohol in December 2008, I find no falsification. These statements, although conflicting, \nare more relevant to Applicant\u2019s denial of his alcohol problem as opposed to a \ndeliberate falsification. SOR \u00b6 2.d is found for Applicant. \n \n \nApplicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to mitigate concerns \nunder personal conduct. Concerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment, trustworthiness, and \nreliability remain.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n13\nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \nduty performance and his success so far while studying for his master\u2019s degree. While \nApplicant received a favorable evaluation from a licensed psychologist in February \n2010, his Answer to the SOR indicates that he was apparently abstaining from alcohol \nduring the evaluation. He resumed drinking alcohol two months later. His current level of \nuse is occasionally five to six beers on a weekend day. Considering Applicant\u2019s lack of \ntruthfulness about his alcohol consumption in past security investigations, it is likely \nApplicant is minimizing his alcohol use during this investigation. He continues to use \nalcohol even though his past use of alcohol has caused problems with his family \nmembers, threatened his security clearance, and resulted in denial of SCI access in \n2003. Doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and judgment. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, are found \nagainst Applicant.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.l: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n14\n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a \u2013 2.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c \u2013 2.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR except \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.r. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 44 years old and works as a technician for a federal contractor. He married in 1987, and has a daughter who is 20 years old. He divorced in 1992, and paid child support until his daughter turned 18 years old. He remarried in 1994, and has a son and two stepsons, who are 15, 20 and 21 years old. They all live at home. The oldest son works and contributes $100 a month to the household. The 20- year-old son goes to school part-time and does not contribute to the household expenses. Applicant\u2019s wife recently attended school for approximately 18 months and is a medical assistant. She took out student loans to finance her education and owes approximately $11,000. She is required to begin paying the loan six months after completion of her schooling. She began employment in September 2009.2 Applicant was employed steadily for 21 years and from 1997 to March 2004, with the same employer. He was unemployed from approximately March 2004 to August 2004, and from August 2006 to October 2006. He changed jobs several times from August 2004 to the present, and was unemployed for short periods of time while transitioning.3 The debts alleged in the SOR are for a repossessed car, medical bills, credit cards, utilities, cable service, video store rentals, and charges to his b",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn May 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuidelines F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 19, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 5, \n2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on August 6, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on September 22, 2009. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 13. \n \n1 \n \n \nOctober 22, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits \n(AE) A through D, which were admitted without objection. The record was held open to \nallow Applicant to submit additional documents, which he did. They were marked as AE \nE through Q. The government had no objections, the documents were admitted, and the \nrecord closed.1 DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 29, \n2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR except \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.r. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 44 years old and works as a technician for a federal contractor. He \nmarried in 1987, and has a daughter who is 20 years old. He divorced in 1992, and paid \nchild support until his daughter turned 18 years old. He remarried in 1994, and has a \nson and two stepsons, who are 15, 20 and 21 years old. They all live at home. The \noldest son works and contributes $100 a month to the household. The 20- year-old son \ngoes to school part-time and does not contribute to the household expenses. \nApplicant\u2019s wife recently attended school for approximately 18 months and is a medical \nassistant. She took out student loans to finance her education and owes approximately \n$11,000. She is required to begin paying the loan six months after completion of her \nschooling. She began employment in September 2009.2  \n \n \nApplicant was employed steadily for 21 years and from 1997 to March 2004, with \nthe same employer. He was unemployed from approximately March 2004 to August \n2004, and from August 2006 to October 2006. He changed jobs several times from \nAugust 2004 to the present, and was unemployed for short periods of time while \ntransitioning.3  \n \nThe debts alleged in the SOR are for a repossessed car, medical bills, credit \ncards, utilities, cable service, video store rentals, and charges to his bank. Two of the \nmedical debts are now judgments. Applicant has approximately $16,470 in delinquent \ndebts that are alleged. He admitted all the delinquent debts alleged except the two \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($213) and 1.r ($194).4 He has not made payments to any of his \ncreditors.5 \n \n \n1 HE I. \n \n2 Tr. 40-48, 57-60. \n \n3 Tr. 16, 33-40. \n \n4 GE 9, 10. \n \n5 Tr. 79-88. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant completed his security clearance application (SCA) in June 2008. He \nwas interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in \nAugust 2008. At his interview he discussed his financial issues and acknowledged most \nof his delinquent debts. He admitted that he had been struggling financially, but since \nbeing employed with his new employer, he earned enough so that he could begin \npaying his past debts. He met with a debt consolidation company and, at the time of his \ninterview, hoped to work out a payment plan within 60 days. He later decided that he \ncould accomplish the same thing that the debt consolidation company offered, and he \nwould not have to pay their fees.6 \n \n \nApplicant wrote letters to many of the creditors in October 2008, acknowledging \nhis delinquent debts and offering to settle the debts for specified amounts over a period \nof time or in a lump sum. He requested they report the account as \u201cpaid as agreed, \nclosed by consumer.\u201d He determined the terms of the payments. He advised them he \nwould not send any money to them until he heard back from them agreeing to his offer. \nAfter he heard back, he would pay within 20 days, in accordance with the terms he set \nout. He did not contact any of the creditors by phone. He did not make any good-faith \npayments to any of his creditors.7  \n \n \nIn August 2009, Applicant sent the same letters again to many of his creditors \noffering to settle his delinquent debts under the same conditions, for a specified amount \nover time or in a lump sum. He did not follow-up on any of his letters by phone or \notherwise.8  \n \n \nApplicant stated he disputed the debts in SOR 1.d, 1.j and 1.k. He stated he \nbelieved the debts in SOR 1.j and 1.k are for the same debt. The evidence offered by \nthe government show two different account numbers. Applicant did not provide any \nsubstantiation to support that the accounts are the same. He did not telephone the \ncompany to determine if the debts are for the same account. He sent a letter disputing \nthe two debts, but also offered to settle the debts. The debt in 1.d is for telephone \nservices. He stated he contacted the creditor who stated the company had no record of \nthe debt. He stated he sent the same dispute letter to the credit bureau that he sent to \nthe creditor.9 \n \n \nApplicant had debts discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1999. He and his \nfirst wife were going through a divorce and custody/child support issues. They had \n \n6 Tr. 71-72; GE 2. \n \n7 Tr. 63-64, 66-68, 92-99; Answer to SOR; AE A-O. Some of the documents do not have a \nsignature. \n \n8 Tr. 66-68; 92-99; AE A-O. Some of the documents are undated and others have original \nsignatures. Applicant stated that he signed the letters and sent them to the creditors and then signed the \ncopies that were provided at his hearing. \n \n9 Tr. 64-66, 68-71; GE 6 p. 9-10, GE 3 p. 2, GE 4 p.2, GE 5 p.2, GE 6 p.5; AE C, J. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \naccumulated between $15,000 and $17,000 of credit card debt that was delinquent and \nsubsequently discharged.10 \n \n \nApplicant experienced some family issues that affected his finances. His mother-\nin-law had medical issues from 1995 to 1997, and he provided approximately $800 to \nhelp her. In 2002 to 2003, she lived with his family and he incurred the extra household \nexpenses for her stay. In 2005, he contributed another $800 to help her. He also \ncontributed about $300 to $400 to help his sister, whose husband was sick from 2003 to \n2005. Applicant provided approximately $300 to help his father who was in a nursing \nhome. Applicant\u2019s father passed away in May 2009, and he incurred $1,700 for his \nshare of the funeral expenses. In August 2009, his grandmother passed away, and he \ncontributed $500 to the family to assist with her funeral.11  \n \n \nApplicant has four judgment/liens against him that were not alleged.12 One \ninvolves a disputed amount on a house Applicant used to live in. He stated his family \nmoved out before the lease expired because of the living conditions. He stated his \nsecurity deposit covered the amount owed.13 The next judgment/lien is for a medical \ndebt that he does not recall.14 The third judgment/lien is from 1999, and Applicant is not \nsure what it was for. The final judgment/lien is for debt on property Applicant rented in \n1998.15  \n \n \nApplicant stated he has a budget on an Excel spread sheet. He believes he has \nabout $400 to $500 in his account left at the end of each month, after paying expenses. \nHe stated he attempted to save his money, but had intervening family issues. He \nexplained the reason he has not paid his debts is because he has been waiting for a \nresponse from his creditors. Prior to October 2008, he did not make an effort to resolve \nhis delinquent debts. Applicant stated he knew he should have followed up on his debts \nwith more than letters.16  \n \n \n10 Tr. 15, 88. \n \n11 Tr. 32-33, 54-57, 61-63, 102-105. \n \n12 GE 7, 8, 11, 12. \n \n13 GE 7. \n \n14 GE 8. \n \n15 Tr. 108-115; GE 11, 12. Depending upon the exact date of the discharge and the date of the \njudgment, these two judgments/liens may have been included in the bankruptcy. I will not consider any \njudgments/liens or other delinquent debts not alleged in the SOR for disqualifying purposes. I will \nconsider them when analyzing the \u201cwhole-person,\u201d Applicant\u2019s complete financial history, and ability to \npay his debts. \n \n16 Tr. 72-77. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant presently has three credit cards that are over his credit limit. He makes \na minimum payment on all three cards. He admitted he missed two payments on one \ncard and one payment on another other card, but made a $30 payment on each card \nrecently.17 \n \n \nApplicant provided character letters that I have considered. A coworker believes \nApplicant to be a team player with high standards. His work performance exceeds the \nhighest quality of workmanship. His character is considered unquestionable. Another \ncoworker stated his team unity, work performance, and ethics cannot be questioned. He \nis considered honest. In addition, Applicant\u2019s stepson provided a letter expressing his \nadmiration for him because of his unconditional love and financial support, even though \nhe was not his biological son. He gives credit to Applicant for providing guidance so he \ncould grow up to be a strong, educated person. He considers Applicant to be a blessing \nand is glad to have him as a father, friend, teacher, supplier, and mentor. I have also \nconsidered the letters in the record that compliment Applicant on his work \nperformance.18 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \n \n17 Tr. 48-54. \n \n18 AE P. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19 and especially considered: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nAppellant has a significant history of not meeting his financial obligations. He has \nmany debts that remain unpaid. I find there is sufficient evidence to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered the following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control\u201d);  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent because his delinquent debts remain unpaid. He \ndid not take action to resolve these debts until his security clearance became an issue. I \nfind mitigating condition (a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant contributed financially to help his mother-in-law when she was ill and \nwhen family members passed away. His mother-in-law last needed assistance in 2005. \nHe contributed for funeral expenses for family members in 2009. These were conditions \nthat were beyond his control and raise the application of mitigating condition (b). In \norder for that mitigating condition to be fully applicable, Applicant must have acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. In this case, Applicant has been employed, \nexcept for short periods since 2004, when he was transitioning between jobs. He made \nno effort to resolve his delinquent debts until his security clearance became an issue. \nHe sent letters to creditors, advising them of his terms. He has not made any payments \nto resolve his delinquent debts. I find mitigating condition (b) only partially applies. \n \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant has received financial counseling, although he \ntestified that he does maintain a budget and considered consolidating his debts. \nApplicant\u2019s offer to settle his debts shows he made a nominal attempt to contact his \ncreditors, after his security clearance became an issue. However, he has not made any \npayments toward resolving his delinquent debts. It is questionable whether a creditor \n\n \n8 \n \n \nwould agree to list the debt as \u201cpaid as agreed, closed by consumer\u201d when it had been \ndelinquent for years and they had yet to see a payment. Applicant does not have any \npayment plans in place to resolve his delinquent debts. They remain unpaid and \nunresolved. Applicant disputed certain debts, but did not provide evidence to \nsubstantiate he does not owe the debts. I do not find Applicant made a good-faith effort \nto resolve his delinquent debts, nor are there clear indications the problem is resolved. I \nfind mitigating conditions (c), (d) and (e) do not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was unemployed for six \nmonths in 2004. He has been employed since then except for short periods of time, \nwhen he transitioned to a new job. He provided some financial assistance to his mother-\nin-law and she lived with his family for a period of time. He recently experienced losses \nin his family and assisted with funeral expenses. Applicant had credit card debts \ndischarged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1999. He has judgments entered against him \nfor delinquent debts. He has numerous other debts that he has not paid. He sent letters \nto creditors after his security clearance became an issue, but has not made any \npayments to resolve any of the debts. Some of the debts are for small amounts. He \ndoes not have any payment plans to resolve his delinquent debts. Although Applicant\u2019s \nintervening family issues may have impacted his finances at different periods of time, he \ndid not do anything to resolve the debts from 2005 to 2009, when those issues were not \na factor. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline \nfor Financial Considerations.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.v: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 26-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He married in 2004, and he divorced in 2007. He is now raising a four-year-old son. It appears this is the first time he has applied for an industrial security clearance, completing an application in May 2008. Applicant completed high school in 2001. He then worked as a clerk for a food business and a fast-food restaurant until he joined the U.S. Army in 2002. He was trained as an automated logistical specialist to work in the field of logistics. He was then assigned to a forward support battalion where he engaged in a pattern of misconduct that resulted in his early discharge from the Army in 2004. For a detailed discussion of nonjudicial punishment, see David A. Schlueter\u2019s Military Criminal Justice 4 Practice and Procedure (4 ed. 1996), Chapter 3, and Army Regulation 27-10, Legal Services\u2013Military Justice, th Chapter 3. Exhibit 7, page 7 of 47. 5 Exhibit 7, page 24 of 47. 6 Exhibit 7, pages 22\u201323 of 47. 7 Exhibit 7, pages 20\u201321 of 47. 8 3 The SOR alleges that Applicant received nonjudicial punishment on six occasions while in the Army. But the record establishes four occasions. Nonjudicial punishment (called Article 15 in the Army and Air Force, captain\u2019s mast in the Navy and Coast Guard, and office hours in the Marine Corps) is a procedure under military law in which the commanding officer imposes punishment against a servicemember for a minor offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (",

The record shows Applicant engaged in a pattern of multiple lesser offenses\nduring 2003\u20132004, when he was a soldier in the U.S. Army. The command imposed\nnonjudicial punishment on him on four occasions, and then administratively separated\nhim from the service due to a pattern of misconduct. Applicant failed to disclose his\nrecord of nonjudicial punishment in his May 2008 security-clearance application; he also\nfailed to disclose past treatment or counseling for his use of alcohol. The facts and\ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s conduct create doubts about his judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. The record contains insufficient evidence to explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Accordingly, as explained below, this case\nis decided against Applicant. \nNovember 20, 2009\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\ndated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive). In addition, because the SOR\nwas issued after September 1, 2006, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, then made\neffective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case. They supersede or replace\nthe guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. \n Directive, Enclosure 3, Paragraph E3.1.7. \n2\n The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting evidence, which\n3\nwill be identified as exhibits in this decision.  \n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant on July 27, 2009. The SOR is equivalent to a complaint and it details the\nfactual basis for the action. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline J for\ncriminal conduct and Guideline E for personal conduct. Also, the SOR recommended\nsubmitting the case to an administrative judge for a determination to deny or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on or about August 6, 2009, when his handwritten\nresponse to the SOR was received by the Agency. He requested a decision without a\nhearing. Accordingly, the case will be decided on the written record.2\nOn August 25, 2009, the government submitted its written case consisting of all\nrelevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing.  This so-called file\n3\nof relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant and received by him on September\n1, 2009. He then had 30 days to submit a documentary response setting forth\nobjections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation. He did not respond within\nthe 30-day period. The case was assigned to me November 9, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He married in 2004,\nand he divorced in 2007. He is now raising a four-year-old son. It appears this is the first\ntime he has applied for an industrial security clearance, completing an application in\nMay 2008.  \nApplicant completed high school in 2001. He then worked as a clerk for a food\nbusiness and a fast-food restaurant until he joined the U.S. Army in 2002. He was\ntrained as an automated logistical specialist to work in the field of logistics. He was then\nassigned to a forward support battalion where he engaged in a pattern of misconduct\nthat resulted in his early discharge from the Army in 2004. \n\n For a detailed discussion of nonjudicial punishment, see David A. Schlueter\u2019s Military Criminal Justice\n4\nPractice and Procedure (4  ed. 1996), Chapter 3, and Army Regulation 27-10, Legal Services\u2013Military Justice,\nth\nChapter 3.\n Exhibit 7, page 7 of 47.\n5\n Exhibit 7, page 24 of 47. \n6\n Exhibit 7, pages 22\u201323 of 47. \n7\n Exhibit 7, pages 20\u201321 of 47. \n8\n3\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant received nonjudicial punishment on six\noccasions while in the Army. But the record establishes four occasions. Nonjudicial\npunishment (called Article 15 in the Army and Air Force, captain\u2019s mast in the Navy and\nCoast Guard, and office hours in the Marine Corps) is a procedure under military law in\nwhich the commanding officer imposes punishment against a servicemember for a\nminor offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Nonjudicial\npunishment is not a court-martial, and it does not constitute a conviction.   \n4\nWhat follows below is a description of Applicant\u2019s record of nonjudicial\npunishment based on four records of proceedings under Article 15, UCMJ:  \n\u2022\nApril 2003\u2013for violation of a lawful general regulation (underage drinking).  It\n5\nstemmed from a drinking-and-driving incident in March 2003, when Applicant\nwas involved in an on-post traffic accident by driving into a light pole. He also\nreceived written counseling for driving while impaired and making false\nstatements stemming from the March 2003 incident.\n\u2022\nJanuary 2004\u2013for disrespectful language toward a noncommissioned officer.6\nThis Article 15 was imposed using summarized proceedings, which limits the\namount of punishment.\n\u2022\nJune 2004\u2013for failure to go to appointed place of duty and two instances of\ndisobeying a lawful order of a noncommissioned officer.   This Article 15 was\n7\nimposed while Applicant was deployed in Afghanistan.\n\u2022\nJuly 2004\u2013for disobeying a lawful general order (wrongfully have sexual\nintercourse with a female solider) and disobeying a lawful order of the battalion\ncommander by being present in one of the battalion\u2019s female tents.  This Article\n8\n15 was imposed while Applicant was deployed in Afghanistan. \nThe July 2004 Article 15 proceeding resulted in Applicant\u2019s reduction from private first\nclass (E3) to private (E1) and 45 days of extra day. \nSeveral days after the last Article 15 was imposed, the Army initiated action to\nadministratively separate Applicant before the end of his term of service due to a pattern\n\n Exhibit 7, pages 13, 14, and 15 of 47. \n9\n Exhibit 7, page 10 of 47. \n10\n Exhibit 6, page 8 of 8. \n11\n Exhibit 6, page 8 of 8. \n12\n Exhibit 7, page 9 of 47. \n13\n Exhibit 7, page 8 of 47. \n14\n Exhibit 5. \n15\n4\nof misconduct.  The task force commander approved the separation action on July 24,\n9\n2004.  In doing so, the commander directed that Applicant be discharged and furnished\n10\na general discharge certificate and not be transferred to the Army\u2019s Individual Ready\nReserve. Applicant was then returned to his battalion\u2019s rear detachment for separation\nprocessing, and he was discharged as ordered on September 29, 2004.  The certificate\n11\nof release or discharge from active duty (commonly known as DD Form 214) shows,\namong other things, the following: (1) type of separation\u2013discharge; (2) reason for\nseparation\u2013pattern of misconduct; and (3) character of service\u2013under honorable\nconditions (general).  He was separated from the Army at the lowest enlisted grade of\n12\nprivate (E1). \nBefore his discharge, the command security manager forwarded a copy of the\nadministrative separation action to the Army\u2019s security-clearance facility with the\ncommander\u2019s recommendation that Applicant\u2019s security clearance be revoked.13\nApplicant\u2019s access to classified information had already been suspended, as the Army\nhad previously granted Applicant a secret-level security clearance. The Army\u2019s security-\nclearance facility intended to use the information to review Applicant\u2019s eligibility, but his\naffiliation with the Army ended before a final resolution due to his discharge in\nSeptember 2004.  \n14\nAfter his discharge, he worked a series of three jobs as a logistics or property\nclerk from October 2004 to September 2007. He then worked as a warehouse\nsupervisor from September 2007 to May 2008. His past employment included working\nin Iraq during 2005\u20132008. \nHe has worked in his current position as an asset manager since May 2008. For\nthat employment, Applicant completed a security-clearance application in May 2008.15\nIn doing so, he was required to provide full, frank, and truthful answers in response to\nquestions about his background. Applicant answered the following questions in the\nnegative without explanation: \n\u2022\nQuestion 19 about Applicant\u2019s military record: Have you ever received other than\nan honorable discharge from the military?\n\n Exhibit 6. \n16\n Exhibit 6, page 3 of 8. \n17\n Exhibit 6, pages 4 and 5 of 8. \n18\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to\n19\na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n20\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n21\n5\n\u2022\nQuestion 23d about Applicant\u2019s police record: Have you ever been charged with\nor convicted of any alcohol- or drug-related offenses?\n\u2022\nQuestion 23e about Applicant\u2019s police record: In the last seven years, have you\nbeen subject to court-martial or other disciplinary proceedings under the UCMJ?\n\u2022\nQuestion 25 about Applicant\u2019s use of alcohol: In the last seven years, has your\nuse of alcohol resulted in any alcohol-related treatment or counseling?\nThe Agency issued written interrogatories to Applicant, to which he responded in\nJanuary 2009.  Concerning why he did not list his alcohol-related arrest and his\n16\ndischarge due to misconduct on his security-clearance application, Applicant explained\nthat he did not pay attention to the questions.  Asked about his use of alcohol and any\n17\nalcohol-related treatment or counseling, Applicant reported that he was no longer\ndrinking alcohol and that he received treatment or counseling at a military facility.18\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations when he answered the SOR, to include\nthe falsification allegations, without explanation. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n19\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n20\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n21\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n22\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n23\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n24\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n25\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n26\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n27\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n28\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n29\n6\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n22\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n23\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n24\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n25\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n26\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.27\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.28\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n29\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16, and 17 (setting forth the security concerns and the disqualifying and\n30\nmitigating conditions). \n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 15. \n31\n7\nAnalysis\nStarting with the falsification allegations, personal conduct under Guideline E30\nincludes issues of false statements and credible adverse information that may not be\nenough to support action under any other guideline. The overall concern is:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n31\nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An\nomission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely\nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely\nthought the information did not need to be reported. \nThe issues here are the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answers to four questions on\nhis May 2008 security-clearance application. As discussed below, two are resolved in\nApplicant\u2019s favor and two are resolved against him.\nThe falsification allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a concerns Question 19. It alleges\nApplicant deliberately failed to list that he had been discharged from the military under\nother than honorable conditions because he failed to disclose his general discharge.\nThis allegation is unproven, because the record contains no evidence to establish\nApplicant was discharged \u201cunder other than honorable conditions.\u201d The record,\nApplicant\u2019s DD Form 214 in particular, shows he was discharged under honorable\nconditions, typically called a general discharge, as directed by the commander.\nAccordingly, this allegation is decided for Applicant.\nThe falsification allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.b concerns Question 23d. It alleges\nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose an alcohol-related charge or conviction based on\nthe March 2003 drinking-and-driving incident, which was the basis for the April 2003\nArticle 15. This allegation is unproven, because the record contains no evidence\nshowing that Applicant was charged with or convicted of an alcohol-related offense. At\nbest, the record shows Applicant was involved in the March 2003 drinking-and-driving\nincident, was probably cited or arrested or both by the military police for driving while\nimpaired, and received nonjudicial punishment for violation of a regulation for underage\ndrinking. Applicant was not charged with or convicted of an alcohol-related offense\nbecause, by definition and design, an Article 15 proceeding is not a judicial process and\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 16(a). \n32\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 30, 31, and 32 (setting forth the security concerns and the disqualifying and\n33\nmitigating conditions). \n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 30. \n34\n8\ndoes not constitute a charge or conviction under military law. Accordingly, this allegation\nis decided for Applicant. \nThe falsification allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.c concerns Question 23e. It alleges\nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his record of nonjudicial punishment. Because\nthis case is decided on the written record, I am unable to assess Applicant\u2019s credibility\nand determine if he omitted his record of four Article 15 proceedings because he\ngenuinely forgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question,\ngenuinely thought the information did not need to be reported, or, as he contends, did\nnot pay attention to the questions. As a former soldier and clearance holder, Applicant\nhad to know that his record of nonjudicial punishment and discharge for misconduct\nmight prevent him from obtaining a clearance. Given these circumstances, the record\nsupports this falsification allegation.\nThe falsification allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.d concerns Question 25. It alleges\nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his alcohol-related treatment. The allegation\nappears to be based upon Applicant\u2019s disclosure of his alcohol-related treatment or\ncounseling when he responded to the Agency\u2019s interrogatories. As a former soldier and\nclearance holder, Applicant had to know that this type of negative information might\nprevent him from obtaining a clearance. Given these circumstances, coupled with his\nomission of his record of nonjudicial punishment, the record supports this falsification\nallegation. \nTaken together, the two established falsifications support application of the\nrelevant disqualifying condition that addresses the deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from a security questionnaire.  I reviewed all the potential\n32\nmitigating conditions under the guideline and conclude none apply. Making false or\nmisleading statements to the federal government during the security-clearance process\nis serious misconduct. It is not easily explained away, excused, or mitigated.\nAccordingly, Guideline E is decided against Applicant. \n   \nUnder Guideline J for criminal conduct,  an applicant\u2019s record of criminal\n33\nconduct raises obvious security concerns. The overall concern is:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.34\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c). \n35\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n36\n Decided for Applicant because it alleges he was counseled for receiving a traffic ticket, and the record does\n37\nnot prove that the traffic offense was criminal conduct. For example, the SOR did not allege, and the record\ndid not establish, that Applicant\u2019s traffic offense was a violation of a punitive regulation issued by the Army.\n Decided for Applicant because he did not receive nonjudicial punishment as alleged.  \n38\n9\nApplicant received nonjudicial punishment for multiple offenses on four\noccasions\u2014twice while deployed to a combat zone\u2014which by itself is sufficient to raise\nsecurity concerns. Added to that, however, is Applicant\u2019s falsification of his security-\nclearance application, which was also alleged under Guideline J in SOR \u00b6 1.h as a\nviolation of federal law (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001) for making a false statement within the\njurisdiction of a federal agency; this is a felony offense. His record of nonjudicial\npunishment for UCMJ violations, combined with a more recent violation of federal law\nby falsifying his security-clearance application, justify application of two disqualifying\nconditions  under Guideline J.   \n35\nI reviewed all the potential mitigating conditions under the guideline and conclude\nnone apply. Although the nonjudicial punishment took place during 2003\u20132004, which\nended about five years ago, it is too soon to tell if Applicant has reformed his ways. This\nconclusion is justified based on his recent criminal conduct by deliberately failing to\ndisclose relevant facts about his background when he completed the May 2008\nsecurity-clearance application. This is both recent and serious criminal conduct.\nAccordingly, Guideline J is decided against Applicant. \nTo conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s conduct\ncreate doubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. He did not present\nsufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. In reaching\nthis conclusion, I considered the nine-factor whole-person concept  and Applicant\u2019s\n36\nfavorable evidence. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\nfavorable clearance decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations, as required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of\nEnclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:\n \nFor Applicant37\nSubparagraph 1.b:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\n \nFor Applicant38\nSubparagraph 1.d:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\n \nAgainst Applicant\n\n Decided for Applicant because he received nonjudicial punishment once in June 2004, not twice as alleged.\n39\n10\nSubparagraph 1.f:\n \nFor Applicant39\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.c and 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

On December 23, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\n\n1See Government Exhibit (GE) 1, Security Clearance Application, at 28; GE 4, Interrogatories, July 9, 2009,\nat 6.  \n2GE 3, Interrogatories, 23 April 2009, includes a letter from an attorney, describing a payment plan for this fine,\nwhich had been approved by the court.  \n2\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G ( Alcohol Consumption)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On August 30, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey\nAnderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s factual\nfindings were supported by substantial record evidence; whether Applicant was denied due process;\nwhether the Judge was biased against Applicant; and whether the Judge failed properly to apply the\nwhole-person factors.  Consistent with the following discussion, we affirm the decision of the Judge.\nThe Judge found that Applicant has a history of excessive alcohol use, continuing \u201coff and\non\u201d from 1973 until at least 2008.  During that time, Applicant had four instances of alcohol-related\noffenses.  In 1992, 2002, and 2008, he was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol\n(DUI).  In 1992 and 2008, he was convicted of DUI.  In 2002, he pled guilty and was convicted of\na form of reckless driving termed \u201cwet reckless.\u201d1  Decision at 3.  During the security clearance\ninterview, Applicant learned that there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest stemming from the\n2002 offense, due to his having failed to pay off his fine.2   In 2000, Applicant was arrested and\ncharged with being drunk in public.  \nApplicant intends to continue drinking alcohol, though he acknowledges that he has a\nproblem with drinking and driving.  He also believes that he is an unlucky person who has been\ncaught.  \nApplicant enjoys an excellent reputation for his integrity, trustworthiness, and job\nperformance.\nApplicant challenges certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact, notably her finding that\nApplicant has abused alcohol off and on during the times stated above.

During that time, Applicant had four instances of alcohol-related offenses. In 1992, 2002, and 2008, he was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI).

Applicant intends to continue drinking alcohol, though he acknowledges that he has a problem with drinking and driving. He also believes that he is an unlucky person who has been caught.

(Government Exhibit 1.)  On December 23, 2009, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\n(as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January\n2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on February 23, 2010, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned Administrative Judge on March 23, 2010.  A notice of hearing was\noriginally issued on March 29, 2010, scheduling the case for May 17, 2010.  An\namended notice of hearing was issued on May 12, 2010, and the hearing was\nrescheduled for May 20, 2010.   At that hearing the Government presented eight\nexhibits referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 8, which were admitted into\nevidence without objection.  The Applicant presented seven exhibits, referred to as\n\n2\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through G, which were admitted without objection.  He called\nthree witnesses and testified on his own behalf.  After the record was closed, the\nApplicant submitted additional documentation that was not admitted into evidence, but\nis noted for the record.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on June 9, 2010. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 55 years old and has a Bachelors\nDegree in Architecture.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Project Manager\nand is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants.\nThe Applicant has a history of excessive alcohol abuse that has continued off\nand on from 1973, until at least September 2008.  Over the past sixteen years of a thirty\nfive year period, the Applicant was charged, arrested and convicted of Driving Under the\nInfluence of Alcohol on three separate occasions, and once for being Drunk in Public.\nFollowing at least two of his arrests for DUI, including his most recent arrest of 2008, the\nApplicant participated in and completed a court ordered alcohol rehabilitation program.  \nThe Applicant started consuming alcohol shortly after high school.  At that time,\nhe drank mostly beer and wine at social settings.  His drinking continued on a daily\nbasis over the years without interruption.  He usually has a beer or two when he gets\nhome from work, and a glass of wine with dinner.  He considers himself a social drinker\nwithout an alcohol problem.  He last had a drink of alcohol the night before the hearing\nto relax.  There is no evidence in the record that he has ever been formally diagnosed\nwith alcoholism, but his pattern of drinking, involving multiple alcohol related offenses,\nindicates a serious alcohol problem.  The following statement of facts outline each\narrest.\n \nIn 1992, the Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence\nof Alcohol.  He explained that he was going through a divorce with his wife and went out\nto a bar.  He had consumed several mixed drinks before leaving the bar.  He was\nfollowed home by the police.  (Government Exhibits 2, 3, 4 and 5.)  He pled guilty and\nwas fined.  He remembers attending two or three Alcohol Awareness classes and one\n\n3\nAlcoholics Anonymous meeting as a result of this conviction.  Following this DUI, he\nrefrained from drinking and driving for over a year.  (Tr. p. 41.)      \nIn December 2000, the Applicant was charged with Drunk in Public.\n(Government Exhibit 6.)  The Applicant explained that he had been consuming alcohol\nat a party before he drove to a restaurant where he fell asleep in the booth.  (Tr. p. 47.)\nHe was  transported and booked into the jail.  Following this arrest, the Applicant\ncurtailed his drinking.  Rather than having two mixed drinks, he went to one glass of\nwine.  (Tr. p. 53.)        \nIn July 2002, he was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence of\nAlcohol.  He stated that he had been celebrating at a bachelor party where he had\nconsumed three shots of bourbon, beer and some champagne before driving.  He then\nwent to a hotel and slept for four hours before driving home.  While driving home, he ran\na red light and was pulled over.  He pled guilty to Wet Reckless.  In 2006, he was\nsentenced to a fine and three years probation.  As of January 2009, his fine had not\nbeen satisfied, and his probation was extended to August 2010.  During his interview\nwith the DoD investigator, he learned that a warrant had been issued for his arrest.  He\nindicated that he would immediately contact the court and pay the outstanding fine.\n(Government Exhibits 2, 3, 4 and 5.)\nIn August 2008, he was arrested and charged with, (1) Driving Under the\nInfluence of Alcohol and (2) Driving While having a 0.08% or Higher Blood Alcohol.  The\nApplicant explained that he had been at a good friend\u2019s home celebrating his friend\u2019s\nbirthday during a barbeque where he had consumed beer and shots of tequila.  On his\nway home, he was pulled over for land drifting.  He pled guilty to Count 1 and was\nsentenced to five days jail, 90 days Driving Under the Influence 1  Offenders Program,\nst\nfined and placed on 36 months probation.  Count 2 was dismissed.  Following this\nincident, he states that he curtailed his drinking.  The Applicant remains on probation for\nthis arrest.  (Tr. p. 70.)  His drivers license was suspended until he finished the 13 week\nalcohol awareness course.  (Government Exhibits 2, 3, 4, and 5).  He has completed his\nsubstance abuse program and his drivers license has been reinstated.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit A.)\nSince his last arrest, the Applicant states that he no longer drinks and drives.\nThe Applicant stated,\nWell, the cornerstone of my case, sir, is that drinking and driving has been\nthe problem that I\u2019ve been concerned with and not necessarily the\nalcoholism because I seriously looked at that when I had to go to the AA\nmeetings for this last conviction and talked to some of the alcoholics there\nand asked them, you know, what is it ? I really wanted to know if I had a\nproblem.  And after six weeks of AA meetings, 13 weeks of the Alcohol\nClasses, I came away with the idea that just really needed to focus in on\nnot driving while I\u2019m consuming alcohol.  (Tr. p. 31.)    \n\n4\nThe Applicant plans to continue to drink in the future.  He does not believe he is\nan alcoholic, but that he has a problem with drinking and driving.  (Tr. p. 65.)  He\nbelieves that he functions in and contributes to society very well.  (Tr. p. 50.)  He also\nbelieves that he is simply an unlucky person who has been caught drinking and driving\non three separate occasions.  (Tr. p. 56.)  When asked whether he would consume\nalcohol the night of the hearing, he stated that he believed that he would have a couple\nof drinks.  (Tr. p. 69.)         \nHe testified that he has worked for his current employer for about three years and\nhis job performance is \u201cabove average\u201d to \u201caverage.\u201d  The Applicant\u2019s supervisor\ntestified that the Applicant has worked for him for about nine months.  He believes the\nApplicant to be an honest, patriotic, trustworthy individual that would do nothing to\njeopardize the national interest.  (Tr. pp. 86-87.)\nA friend of the Applicant testified that he is trustworthy, honest, loyal and a man\nof his word.  He considers him an individual who would do nothing to jeopardize the\nnational interests.  (Tr. p. 88.)  The Applicant\u2019s son testified that his father instilled the\nsense of working hard, patience, and the larger tasks will be completed a little at a time.\n(Tr. p. 92-94.)  \nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s current supervisor, a project\nmanager, coworkers, and a former supervisor attest to his professionalism, honesty and\nintegrity.  Since working for his current employer, he has been a valuable member of the\nteam.  He is always reliable and dependable, and has proven himself time and time\nagain to be of upstanding character.  He has an excellent attendance record and\nnormally works beyond the normal business day to complete his assigned tasks and\nprojects.  He is highly recommended for a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B, C,\nD, E and F.) \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption)\n21.  The Concern.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n22. (a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\n\n5\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent;\n22. (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and \n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\n\n6\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSION\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in alcohol and drug abuse that demonstrates poor judgment\nor unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in alcohol abuse (Guideline G).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guideline G of the SOR.  Under Alcohol Abuse, Guideline G,\ndisqualifying conditions 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as\ndriving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace,\nor other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d and, 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of\nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d apply.  None of the mitigating\nconditions are applicable.\nOver the past sixteen years of a thirty-five year history of alcohol consumption,\nthe Applicant has been arrested on four occasions,  three times for Driving Under the\nInfluence of Alcohol, and once for being Drunk In Pubic.  Multiple alcohol related\ninfractions are indicative of a serious alcohol problem.  Although his most recent arrest\noccurred in 2008, two years ago, there is no evidence in the record that the Applicant\nhas stopped drinking, or reduced his drinking for any significant period of time that\n\n7\nwould establish a pattern of abstinence or responsible use as required by the DoD\nDirective. \nAlthough there is no formal diagnosis in the record of alcohol dependence, the\nApplicant\u2019s pattern of alcohol abuse is clearly indicative of a serious alcohol problem.\nBased upon his long history of alcohol abuse and its related effects on the Applicant\nthere is insufficient evidence in the record to show that he is sufficiently trustworthy for\naccess to classified information at this time. Accordingly Guideline G is found against\nthe Applicant. \n    \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth above, when viewed under all of the guidelines as a\nwhole, support a whole-person assessment of poor judgement, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.\n  \nConsidering all of the evidence presented, it does not come close to mitigating\nthe negative effects of his alcohol problem, and the impact that they can have on his\nability to safeguard classified information.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant\nhas failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a security\nclearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the\nfactual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.    \n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \n\n8\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey-Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He had his filing converted to Chapter 7 and was discharged in 2001. The same year, he worked with a mortgage company to \u201cshort sale\u201d his house, which resulted in a $25,000 loss that the bank agreed to write off. In 2004 Applicant purchased a home for $225,000, and, two years later, he purchased two rental properties for $80,000 a piece. He made no down payments in buying these two rental properties. He neglected to have these properties inspected prior to the purchase, and later he had to expend $16,000 for repairs. He put these expenses on his credit cards. After tenants damaged the houses, Applicant charged another $15,000 on his credit cards for repairs. He stopped making mortgage payments on these houses in 2008, and they have gone into foreclosure.

On March 18, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n\n2\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On August 24, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Carol G.\nRicciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s factual\nfindings are erroneous; whether the Judge gave appropriate consideration to his evidence in\nmitigation; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant purchased a home in\n1997, using credit cards and loans to furnish it.  Discovering that he would not be able to pay off the\ndebt he had incurred, he filed for bankruptcy.  He initially filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection\nbut had trouble making payments under it.  He had his filing converted to Chapter 7 and was\ndischarged in 2001.  The same year, he worked with a mortgage company to \u201cshort sale\u201d his house,\nwhich resulted in a $25,000 loss that the bank agreed to write off.  \nIn 2004 Applicant purchased a home for $225,000, and, two years later, he purchased two\nrental properties for $80,000 a piece.  He made no down payments in buying these two rental\nproperties.  He neglected to have these properties inspected prior to the purchase, and later he had\nto expend $16,000 for repairs.  He put these expenses on his credit cards.  After tenants damaged the\nhouses, Applicant charged another $15,000 on his credit cards for repairs.  He stopped making\nmortgage payments on these houses in 2008, and they have gone into foreclosure.  \nApplicant entered into a relationship with a debt elimination company, which entails his\ndepositing money each month to be used settling his debts.  However, he has not participated in\nfinancial counseling.  Beginning in 2004, Applicant carried 18 credit cards, which he used to\nmaintain his investment properties.  He also had some personal loans.  Applicant did not provide\ndocumentation to support his claim that he had paid off some of his debts.\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in some of her factual findings.  For example, he\ntakes issue with the Judge\u2019s statement that he could not afford the rental properties and that he had\nused credit cards to pay expenses associated with maintaining them.  On this latter point, he contends\nthat he had used his credit cards only after having depleted investment funds he had set aside for\nmaintenance expenses.  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material\nfindings are based on substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences\nthat could be drawn from the record.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change\nthe outcome of the case.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings\nof security concern are sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).\n In support of the appeal Applicant has submitted new matters not contained in the record,\nfor example information about a job loss.  The Board cannot consider this new evidence.  See\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal Board.\u201d).  See\n\n3\nalso ISCR Case No. 08-06518 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 3, 2009).  Applicant appears to contend that the\nJudge did not give proper consideration to his evidence in mitigation.  However, a Judge is presumed\nto have considered all the evidence in the record.  Neither Applicant\u2019s presentation on appeal nor the\nrecord rebut that presumption.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009);\nISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  The record does not support an allegation\nthat the Judge excluded evidence proffered by Applicant.  The Board notes that the Judge did\nexplicitly consider that Applicant\u2019s difficulties with the rental properties were due in part to tenants\nhaving damaged the houses and that Applicant had entered into a debt repayment plan with the\nabove-referenced company.  She also found that one of the mortgage debts in the SOR had been\nresolved through foreclosure.  However, the Judge also noted the repetitive nature of Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems, in that Applicant purchased two rental homes after having been discharged in\na bankruptcy action that was, in large measure, the result of debt connected to real estate.  She\nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s conduct in managing his financial affairs demonstrated a lack of\njudgement, in part because he did not anticipate the foreseeable costs of maintaining rental property,\nincluding costs necessitated by tenant misuse.\nThe Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory\nexplanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the\nchoice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The Judge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not clearly in the interests of national security to grant\nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance\u201d is sustainable on this record.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn March 18, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant responded in writing to the SOR in an undated answer received on \nApril 6, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was \nassigned to me on July 13, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on July 14, 2009. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled on August 6, 2009. The Government offered \n \n1 \n \n \nAugust 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 8. Applicant did not object and they were admitted. The \nGovernment also offered a demonstrative exhibit that was marked as HE I. Applicant \ntestified and offered Exhibits (AE) A through I, which were admitted without objection. \nThe record was held open until August 13, 2009, to allow Applicant an opportunity to \nprovide additional exhibits, which he did, and they were marked as AE J through U. The \nGovernment did not object and they were admitted.1 DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on August 11, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR, except \u00b6 1.b. His admissions \nare incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 53 years old and has worked for different federal contractors since \n1994. He has two associate\u2019s degrees. He married in 1981 and has two grown children, \none of whom resides with him. His wife earns approximately $100 a month.2  \n \n \nApplicant purchased a home in 1997. He used credit cards and loans to furnish \nthe home. He made minimum payments on the credit cards. He realized that by making \nonly the minimum payments the debt would be very difficult to pay off with the additional \ninterest accruing. He was also paying for a leased car at the time. He returned the car \nand filed for bankruptcy. He initially filed under Chapter 13 to keep from losing his \nhouse. He had difficulty maintaining the payments under the Chapter 13 and it was \nconverted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Applicant had approximately $35,000 in debt \ndischarged in bankruptcy. The mortgage company worked with Applicant to \u201cshort sale\u201d \nhis residence. It was sold and Applicant believes there was approximately a $25,000 \nloss that the bank agreed to write off. The bankruptcy discharge and the short sale of \nhis house were completed in 2001.3  \n \n \nIn 2004, Applicant purchased a home for approximately $225,000.4 In 2006, \nApplicant bought two residential rental properties for $80,000 each, with no down \npayment. He was not hesitant to purchase the property because he viewed the \ninvestment as a way to earn extra income. He did not have the properties inspected and \n \n1. Department Counsel\u2019s memorandum in response to the additional exhibits is HE II. In AE J, \nApplicant requested an unspecified extension in time. His request was denied. HE III. \n \n2 Tr. 35-41. \n \n3 Tr. 29-33, 41-59; GE 6; AE A. Applicant provided a document that shows his attorney was later \ndisbarred for misconduct. Applicant alleges that his attorney, without his permission, later changed his \nbankruptcy filing to a Chapter 13 and forged his name. Applicant\u2019s mortgage counselor arranged for the \nfiling to be dropped. The attorney\u2019s actions ultimately did not have a bearing on Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy. \nThis information pertains to SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n \n4 Tr. 56-59. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nlater realized it would take a lot of money to get the properties up to standards so he \ncould rent them. He stated:  \n \nThe property wasn\u2019t beat up at the time, it just had\u2014the person who sold \nthe house basically had covered up a lot of things. He put new carpet in \nand he painted to make the place look good when you came in. But I had \nplumbing problems, I had electrical problems, I had problems with the \nstructures of the house. I had, you know, problems that you wouldn\u2019t \nnecessarily see just walking in the door.5 \n \nHis monthly mortgage payment on the two properties was $1,300. He estimated that he \nspent approximately $16,000 within the first three months to rehabilitate the properties. \nHe charged the expenses to credit cards. He eventually rented both properties, but had \ndifficulty with the tenants. In 2007, one tenant broke the lease and had damaged the \nproperty. The other tenant rented for a year, but then left and also damaged the \nproperty. Applicant estimated that it cost him another $15,000 to repair both properties. \nHe again charged the expenses to credit cards. He fell behind in paying his credit cards. \nOne property remained vacant for more than a year. He stopped making his mortgage \npayments on one of the properties in February 2008 and on the other in October 2008. \nThe properties were foreclosed in February 2009. He testified that he does not owe any \nremainder on the foreclosed property. The credit report shows one of the properties has \na zero balance and the other states the \u201cforeclosure process started.\u201d Applicant did not \nprovide documented proof that he does not owe anything on the property in the process \nof foreclosure.6  \n \n \nIn October 2007, Applicant contacted a debt elimination company. He deposits \n$700 a month into an account. From that account the company automatically withdraws \n$325 a month in fees for 15-months. The remaining $375 is placed in a savings account \nthat Applicant is free to access as he desires. When he accumulates enough money in \nhis savings account, he contacts the company and requests them to negotiate a \nsettlement for one of his debts. He testified that he has completed paying the 15-month \nfee, so all the money now goes to settle his debts.7  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts consist of two foreclosure properties ($69,585 and $71,391, \n(see above), credit cards, and personal loans. He stated that beginning in 2004 he had \napproximately 18 credit cards.8 He stated he used these credit cards to maintain his \n \n5 Tr. 63-64. \n \n6 Tr. 33-35, 55-70, 104-105; GE 3 at page 3; GE 4 at page 3. \n \n7 Tr. 72-84, 105-107; GE 6. \n \n8 Tr. 78 84, 100-104, 129-134. Applicant opened some accounts in his name, some in his wife\u2019s \nname and some jointly. He admitted his applications for some of the credit cards were declined. He also \nadmitted he is the primary wage earner and it is from his income that the bills are paid. It appears that \nApplicant likely has more delinquent debts than are alleged because some of the credit cards are in his \nwife\u2019s name alone and she does not earn enough money to pay them. I will only consider the debts \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \ninvestment property. The debt alleged in SOR 1.j ($1,203) is for jewelry he purchased. \nHe stated he purchased jewelry before he filed for bankruptcy and stopped making \npayment when he filed for bankruptcy in 2001. His credit report shows he opened this \naccount in September 2005 and the last activity on the account was November 2007. I \ndid not find him credible. He provided AE U to show there is an offer by the creditor to \nsettle this account. However, it appears that the original creditor is different and this \ndocument does not support his position. He did not provide any documentation to show \nhe accepted the offer on this debt and paid it.9  \n \n \n \nApplicant stated that he has paid six credit cards and still owes on three credit \ncards. He did not provide proof of payment or explain which credit cards were paid.10 \nHe provided a spread sheet that lists 25 credit card and bank debts. Ten of the debts \nlisted are for ten separate accounts with the same credit card company. He annotated \nsome of the debts as having been paid or that he is paying, but did not provide any \ndocumented proof that the debts have been paid.11 He also provided a spread sheet \nfrom his debt elimination company that lists 20 debts. On it there are handwritten \nannotations that are illegible.12 He provided letters from creditors offering to settle his \ndebts. He did not provide any proof that he agreed to the settlements and paid them.13 \nBased on the number of debts and the fact that many of the debts are to the same \ncreditor, but for different accounts, it is unclear as to which debts the offers apply. He \nprovided one settlement offer that notes he made a $100 payment on May 22, 2009, on \na credit card account that has a balance of $8,096. He explained that the debt \nelimination company plan was not able to settle directly with the creditor, so he dealt \nwith them and pays the creditor directly. He did not provide proof of any additional \npayments. He believed the total amount he owes on all of the debts is $40,000.14 \n \n \nApplicant stated that AE I, a settlement offer, applies to SOR 1.o. He did not \nprovide proof of payment. He was afforded additional time to provide a document to \n \nalleged in the SOR for disqualifying purposes. I will consider all of the delinquent debts that are included \nin his documents, when analyzing Applicant\u2019s overall financial situation and when analyzing the whole \nperson. \n  \n9 Tr. 79-83, 112-115; GE 2 at page 10. \n \n10 Tr. 74-75. \n \n11 AE B. \n \n12 AE C. \n \n13 AE D, E, F, H, I. \n \n14 Tr. 76-90, 98-102; AE G. It is unclear if this debt is alleged in the SOR. Applicant could not \nprovide details whether this account is included in the SOR. He has numerous accounts from the same \ncreditor and explained he cannot tell which account this document applies.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nshow he accepted and paid the settlement. The additional document he provided, AE Q, \nis the same as AE l.15  \n \nApplicant stated AE D applies to one of his credit card accounts, but he does not \nknow which one in the SOR. He stated he paid it on July 13, 2009, but did not provide \nsupporting documents. He provided AE O, which is the same document as AE D.16  \n \n \nApplicant stated he settled a debt to a creditor in the SOR and the document in \nAE E is the settlement offer. There are two creditors with the same name listed in the \nSOR. It is unclear which debt he believes is paid. There is no proof of payment.17  \n \n \nApplicant stated that the document in AE F is for a debt in the SOR, but could not \nprovide specific information as to which debt. It is a settlement offer on a credit card \naccount. He also offered AE T which reflects a one-time payment of $50 made in June \n2009. It appears there is approximately a $1,000 balance remaining. \n \n \nApplicant did not provide any documents to support that any of his debts have \nbeen paid. There are other debts listed in the documents he provided that appear to be \nadditional debts that were not alleged in the SOR. They could be the same debts as \nalleged in the SOR or they could be duplicate debts, or they could be additional debts. \nApplicant was unable to provide an explanation. \n \n \nApplicant was provided additional time to submit documents to support his \nstatements that he paid certain debts. AE K, L, M, N, P, R, and S are letters from \ncreditors on accounts in his wife\u2019s name and are not debts alleged in the SOR. AE K, L, \nand M reflect that the accounts noted have been settled. AE N, O, and P are settlement \noffers, but there is no proof of payment. AE R is a settlement letter acknowledging a \n$100 payment made on July 22, 2009, on an account with a balance of $8,033 still \nowed. AE S is a settlement offer to his wife, dated October 23, 2008, accepting an \nagreement that Applicant would pay $125 a month beginning in November 2008 on a \ndebt with a balance of $950. I have not considered these matters for disqualifying \npurposes, but have considered them when analyzing Applicant\u2019s credibility and overall \nfinancial health. \n \n \nIn December 2007, Applicant and his family took a one-week cruise to the \nBahamas. He explained it was part of a package deal where they received the cruise for \nparticipating in a time-share informational package.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common-sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n \nremembered the cruise was in December 2007. I found Applicant to be evasive and his testimony not \ncredible. \n \n19 Tr. 123-124. \n\n \n7 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant had $35,000 in credit card and other debts discharged in bankruptcy in \n2001. He again accumulated substantial credit card debts that he could not pay. He \npurchased two rental properties that he could not maintain and they were foreclosed. I \nfind both disqualifying conditions have been raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and especially considering the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n\n \n8 \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent because he still owes the debts alleged. I find \nmitigating condition (a) does not apply. Applicant bought a house he could not afford \nand then attempted to furnish it by using credit cards and loans. He filed for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy and had $35,000 in debt discharged. The house was sold as a \u201cshort sale\u201d \nand the bank wrote off the deficiency. He then bought two rental properties. He did not \ninspect the properties and later found they were in need of repair. He financed the \nrepairs with credit cards. He had difficulty renting the property. When he did, one tenant \nbroke the lease early and defaced the property. The other completed the term of the \nlease, but also defaced the property. Applicant again financed these repairs with credit \ncards. He subsequently could not find tenants and defaulted on the mortgages and the \nproperties were foreclosed. On the credit report one property (SOR 1.l) shows a zero \nbalance owed. I find this debt is resolved. Applicant made poor business decisions \nwhen he purchased property without having it inspected. He also took on a great deal of \ndebt without having sufficient capital to pay for expected and unexpected repairs. He \nhoped to make money. He did not. Deciding to become a landlord, with all the \nresponsibilities that go with it was within his control. As a landlord, having to perform \nrepairs after tenants leave, or having tenants vacate early is somewhat expected when \none acts in that capacity. However, to a certain extent these things were not within his \ncontrol, but it should not have been totally unexpected. Therefore, I find mitigating \ncondition (b) only partially applies.  \n \n \nIt appears Applicant has set up a debt elimination plan. However, it also appears \nthat he has more delinquent debt than is alleged in the SOR, because in addition to \napplying for credit cards in his own name, and jointly, his wife also obtained credit cards \nto finance the repairs on his rental property. He is the wage earner in the family and was \nexpected to pay her credit cards too. He did not provide sufficient evidence to show he \nis addressing all of his delinquent debts. It appears he has approximately 20 to 25 \ndifferent credit cards and loans. He does not know which ones have been paid and \nwhich he still owes. It is likely he has paid some of the credit cards completely. \nHowever, he does not have a firm grasp on all of his debts. I do not have confidence \nthat his financial problems are being resolved or are under control. I find mitigating \nconditions (c) and (d) do not apply.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant overextended his finances \nwhen he bought a house he could not afford and then financed its furnishings with credit \ncards and loans. His house was sold and he had $35,000 in delinquent debts \ndischarged in bankruptcy in 2001. He repeated the same mistake several years later \nwhen he purchased two rental properties and financed the repairs through credit cards \nand loans. Applicant saw this as an opportunity to make money, but failed to consider \nthe potential problems with owning rental property. The properties were foreclosed and \nhe has approximately 20 to 25 credit cards and loans. He did not provide sufficient proof \nthat he does not owe any amount on one of the foreclosed properties. Applicant may \nhave paid some of the credit card debts, but he was unable to provide proof as to which \nones were paid. Even if I considered the evidence in the light most favorable to \nApplicant and conclude he has paid some of his debts, it is not sufficient to conclude he \nhas mitigated the security concern raised by his finances. Applicant has a history of \nrunning up debts and either having them discharged in bankruptcy, defaulting on them, \nor settling them for less than the amount actually owed. I also found that when \nquestioned about other expenditures not related to the rental property, Applicant was \nevasive and not candid. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from \nFinancial Considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs  1.a-1.h: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.l:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.m-1.q: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly not in the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 18, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On August 24, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Carol G.\nRicciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s factual\nfindings are erroneous; whether the Judge gave appropriate consideration to his evidence in\nmitigation; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n2\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant purchased a home in\n1997, using credit cards and loans to furnish it.  Discovering that he would not be able to pay off the\ndebt he had incurred, he filed for bankruptcy.  He initially filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection\nbut had trouble making payments under it.  He had his filing converted to Chapter 7 and was\ndischarged in 2001.  The same year, he worked with a mortgage company to \u201cshort sale\u201d his house,\nwhich resulted in a $25,000 loss that the bank agreed to write off.  \nIn 2004 Applicant purchased a home for $225,000, and, two years later, he purchased two\nrental properties for $80,000 a piece.  He made no down payments in buying these two rental\nproperties.  He neglected to have these properties inspected prior to the purchase, and later he had\nto expend $16,000 for repairs.  He put these expenses on his credit cards.  After tenants damaged the\nhouses, Applicant charged another $15,000 on his credit cards for repairs.  He stopped making\nmortgage payments on these houses in 2008, and they have gone into foreclosure.  \nApplicant entered into a relationship with a debt elimination company, which entails his\ndepositing money each month to be used settling his debts.  However, he has not participated in\nfinancial counseling.  Beginning in 2004, Applicant carried 18 credit cards, which he used to\nmaintain his investment properties.  He also had some personal loans.  Applicant did not provide\ndocumentation to support his claim that he had paid off some of his debts.\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in some of her factual findings.  For example, he\ntakes issue with the Judge\u2019s statement that he could not afford the rental properties and that he had\nused credit cards to pay expenses associated with maintaining them.  On this latter point, he contends\nthat he had used his credit cards only after having depleted investment funds he had set aside for\nmaintenance expenses.  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material\nfindings are based on substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences\nthat could be drawn from the record.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change\nthe outcome of the case.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings\nof security concern are sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).\n In support of the appeal Applicant has submitted new matters not contained in the record,\nfor example information about a job loss.  The Board cannot consider this new evidence.  See\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal Board.\u201d).  See\nalso ISCR Case No. 08-06518 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 3, 2009).  Applicant appears to contend that the\nJudge did not give proper consideration to his evidence in mitigation.  However, a Judge is presumed\nto have considered all the evidence in the record.  Neither Applicant\u2019s presentation on appeal nor the\nrecord rebut that presumption.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009);\nISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  The record does not support an allegation\nthat the Judge excluded evidence proffered by Applicant.  The Board notes that the Judge did\nexplicitly consider that Applicant\u2019s difficulties with the rental properties were due in part to tenants\nhaving damaged the houses and that Applicant had entered into a debt repayment plan with the\nabove-referenced company.  She also found that one of the mortgage debts in the SOR had been\nresolved through foreclosure.  However, the Judge also noted the repetitive nature of Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems, in that Applicant purchased two rental homes after having been discharged in\n\n3\na bankruptcy action that was, in large measure, the result of debt connected to real estate.  She\nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s conduct in managing his financial affairs demonstrated a lack of\njudgement, in part because he did not anticipate the foreseeable costs of maintaining rental property,\nincluding costs necessitated by tenant misuse.\nThe Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory\nexplanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the\nchoice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Roberts, Esquire\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn March 24, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether his clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 21, 2009, and requested a hearing.  The\ncase was assigned to me on June 23, 2009, and was scheduled for hearing on August\n18, 2009.  A hearing was held on the scheduled date for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny,\nor revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance. At the hearing, the Government's case\nconsisted of three exhibits (ex.); Applicant relied on four witnesses (including himself)\nNovember 12, 2009\n\n2\nand 12 exhibits.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 25, 2009.  Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access classified\ninformation is granted.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline J, Applicant is alleged to have been arrested in September 2005\nand charged with felony battery with substantial abuse of victim over 60.  He is alleged to\nhave pleaded guilty to the charge in October 2006, and was sentenced to between 2 to 5\nyears in prison, plus an additional consecutive term of 2 to 5 years due to the victim\u2019s\nage (suspended), placed on probation for five years and house arrest for one year, and\nordered to attend anger management and pay $15,000 in restitution.\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation. He provided no\nexplanations. \n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 44-year-old quality assurance inspector for a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nBackground\nApplicant enjoyed a normal childhood while growing up in a neighboring state.  He\nearned good grades in primary and secondary schools and was active in Boy Scouts\n(see ex. A; Tr. 57).  He has two older sisters.\nAfter completing his high school education, Applicant worked as a cashier for a\nlocal company for several years. In 1984, he enlisted in the Air Force (Tr. 89). He\nreceived technician training early in his Air Force career and served as an aircraft\ntechnician for the first five plus years of his enlistment-1985 to 1990 (Tr. 59-60). \nIn 1996, Applicant volunteered to work on a classified aircraft program at another\nAir Force base facility (Tr.60). He worked on this program before transferring to an\naircraft surveillance position in another command at the same base facility (Tr. 60-61).\nHe describes himself as one of several non-commissioned officers (NCOs) who served\nas quality assurance evaluators and liaison between the Government and the facility\ncontractor (Tr. 61-62).\nApplicant received his first security clearance in 1984 and has held a clearance\ncontinuously since that time (Tr. 63).  He never had an adverse incident during his 22\nyears of active duty in the Air Force. His credibility is excellent, and his assurances are\naccepted. His consistent practice during his years of active duty was to report any\nsecurity violation he found or observed to his command (Tr.  63-64).   \n\n3\nFollowing his retirement from the Air Force in November 2005, Applicant came to\nwork for his current employer as a quality assurance inspector. His current duties include\ntechnical dispatching of aircraft readiness inspectors (Tr. 64-65).\nApplicant married in 1993.  His spouse had one young son who resided with them\nafter their marriage. His mother-in-law also came to live with them following their\nmarriage (Tr. 67).  Applicant has four children from his marriage: two sons (ages 15 and\n7) and two daughters (ages 13 and 12). \nApplicant and his spouse frequently argued after their first year of marriage and\ndivorced in 1997 due to irreconcilable differences (Tr. 67, 90-93).  Before their divorce,\nhis wife obtained a temporary protective order (TPO), citing physical violence (throwing a\nchair at her that she avoided). Applicant denied the charge (Tr. 92, 105), but did not\nchallenge her claims in court (Tr. 109-10). During the six months or so that the TPO was\nenforced, Applicant was permitted to see his children (Tr. 108). This was the only\nphysical incident claimed by his wife during their first marriage. \nIn 2001, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife approached him about reconciling.  Applicant agreed\nand moved into her house; they remarried that same year (Tr. 93).  \nDuring their marriage, Applicant\u2019s stepson was always hard to control, and\noccasionally became disruptive. He was often in trouble in school and in the\nneighborhood, and was never very close to Applicant (see ex. A). Applicant recalled\nseveral arguments with his mother-in-law over disciplining his stepson. He described his\nmother-in-law as a very bitter and angry person, who was abused in the past by her\nhusband (see ex. A; Tr. 106).  Between 2001 and September 2005, Applicant never\nengaged in any type of abusive behavior (either physical or mental) around anyone in his\nhousehold (Tr. 94).  Nor were there any allegations of abuse that Applicant is aware of\n(Tr. 94). \nSeptember 2005 assault incident\nOn or about September 26, 2005, Applicant was called to school to discuss the\nre-enrollment of his stepson (age 13 at the time) with school officials (Tr. 68). The\nmeeting with school officials did not end very well: the stepson remained expelled from\nschool (tr. 68-69).  When Applicant arrived home following his meeting with school\nofficials, he tried to tell his wife what transpired at the meeting (Tr. 69). His stepson\nintervened and forcefully disputed Applicant\u2019s account (Tr. 96). After the stepson became\nincreasingly contentious, Applicant told the stepson to go to his room (Tr. 96).  When the\nstepson verbally refused, Applicant grabbed him by his shirt, repeated his demands, and\npushed him (albeit, not very hard) towards his room (Tr. 69, 97-99).  \nAt this point, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law took exception to Applicant\u2019s demands of\nhis stepson and aggressively moved inches from his face to confront him (Tr. 69-70; 97-\n99).  Instead of retreating, he grabbed her with both hands and pushed her away from\nhim, but not to the ground (Tr. 70, 86, 98). His mother-in-law, who suffered from\n\n4\nadvanced osteoporosis (a condition known to Applicant), stumbled over an object as she\nwas pushed, fell backwards, and dropped to the floor, breaking her shoulder and elbow\nin the fall (Tr. 70, 86-87).  The stepson then ran next door and called the police, who\narrived at the scene a short time later.  When the police arrived, they took statements\nfrom the participants (see ex. 2; Tr.71). Upon completing their investigation at the scene,\nthe police arrested Applicant and escorted him to the local police station for holding (Tr.\n71). After he was booked and released (September 28, 2005).  At his wife\u2019s invitation, he\nreturned home to their residence (see ex. 2; Tr.71).\nThe following day, Applicant appeared in court to face assault charges, and was\ntold by the presiding judge that the charges had been dropped (Tr. 72).  He continued to\nreceive calls, however, from his sister-in-law threatening him with additional charges\n(see ex. 2).  He was concerned enough about these calls that in November 2005 he\ncontacted an attorney to represent him in the matter.\nApplicant\u2019s retained attorney initially told him the assault charges were still being\npursued by prosecutors, but only as misdemeanors (ex. 2; Tr. 72). Shortly thereafter,\nthough, the court clerk advised Applicant by letter that prosecutors determined to pursue\nthe charges as a felony, once they learned of the victim\u2019s age (Tr. 72).  When his\nattorney appeared in court (sometime in November 2005), prosecutors confirmed that\nthe misdemeanor charges had been dropped and replaced with felony charges (see ex.\n2).  \nAppearing at his trial-setting hearing in February 2006, Applicant pleaded not\nguilty to the felony charge and received a scheduled trial date in October 2006.  When\nhe appeared for trial, he changed his plea (based on the advice of his attorney) to guilty\n(see ex. 2).  At a subsequently convened sentencing hearing in October 2006, the court\naccepted his guilty plea, and sentenced him to 2 to 5 years of incarceration (suspended),\nplus an additional term of 2 to 5 years because the victim was over 65 years of age (see\nexs. 2 and 3).\nAt his sentencing hearing, the court suspended Applicant\u2019s sentence and placed\nhim under five years of probation, and one year of house arrest with a monitoring device\nto control his movements (see ex. 2; Tr. 101-02). The court also ordered Applicant to\nhave no contact with his mother-in-law, pay restitution in the amount of $15,000, and\ncomplete an anger management course (ex. 2).  \nUnder a court-approved five-year plan, Applicant has been making his restitution\npayments at the rate of $257 a month (Tr. 74-75). To date, he has reduced his restitution\nbalance to just over $6,000 (Tr. 74-75).  He is current with his monthly payments and\nhopes to satisfy the remaining balance within the next 12 months (Tr. 75).\nApplicant has satisfactorily completed each of the Court\u2019s imposed conditions,\nincluding his anger management class, and has been informed by his probation officer\nthat his probation would likely end in November 2009 (Tr. 74,100-03). He maintains\n\n5\ncontact with his probation officer once a month (Tr. 81). He has undertaken no\npsychological counseling since completing his anger management course.  \nPost-assault relationship with his family\nApplicant lived with his wife for approximately three months following the\nSeptember 2005 incident while the mother-in-law was in the hospital recuperating (Tr.\n110-11).  Shortly after his mother-in-law returned from the hospital (some three months\nlater), Applicant received in close succession his letter from the clerk (indicating he was\ngoing to be charged with a felony) and service of a TPO obtained by his wife (Tr. 95,\n111-12).  He tried talking to his wife after receiving the TPO papers, but she declined to\naddress him (Tr. 113-14).  Once he vacated the premises, he was not permitted to talk\nwith his wife or children.  Later, after Applicant had vacated his home, the presiding court\ndissolved this TPO  (Tr. 94-95).\n Applicant and his wife divorced for the second time in Spring 2006 (see exs. 2\nand A).  The terms of the divorce decree require Applicant to pay child support to his four\nchildren in the amount of $1,400 a month.  He has visitation rights three times a week,\nand is required to keep health insurance on the children (see ex. 2). Applicant and his\nwife finalized their divorce in late May 2006. \nUnder the terms of their divorce, his wife has exclusive physical custody over their\nfour children.  Albeit, Applicant has joint legal custody with his ex-wife of his children (Tr.\n117). Their home remains under joint ownership; his wife continues to reside in the\nresidence with their children and pays the monthly mortgage.  Applicant\u2019s unsupervised\nvisitation privileges entitle him to see his children twice a week, on alternate weekends,\nand on holidays (Tr. 77-78). He is authorized to address the children about any problems\nthat might emerge in their visits with Applicant (Tr. 78-79). \nSince their divorce, Applicant\u2019s wife has not remarried.  He remains on good civil\nterms with his ex-wife.  His stepson is currently being home schooled; he uses an on-line\nprogram (Tr. 105).\nApplicant expresses considerable remorse for his actions that caused injury to his\nmother-in-law.  He realizes that he must do better in controlling his emotions and avoid\nany escalation of a dispute, should one arise in the future (Tr. 84-85).  He thinks about\nthe incident with his mother-in-law every day and recognizes he took the wrong course of\naction when he pushed her away from him (Tr. 84).  \nEndorsements and performance evaluations\nApplicant has excellent performance evaluations to his credit.  He documents\npraiseworthy performance credits and promotions in the Air Force over the course of his\n20-year career (see ex. D). Applicant\u2019s program chief in his Air Force flight squadron\ncharacterized him as an outstanding employee who has never let his 2005 incident and\n\n6\nsubsequent divorce affect his work in any way (see ex. V; Tr. 37-38).  He considers the\nincident to be out of character for Applicant and an isolated event (Tr. 41-44).\n  \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor who interfaced with Applicant while he was still an\nAir Force liaison, considers him a very professional and valued employee (see ex. S; Tr.\n44-47).  He expressed familiarity with Applicant\u2019s 2005 incident and marital status with\nhis ex-wife (Tr. 50-52).  Pressed for his understanding of the incident, he indicated the\nincident arose out of a heated domestic dispute that got out of hand and prompted\nApplicant to push his mother-in-law (Tr. 50).  He recollects Applicant\u2019s being remorseful\nover the incident (Tr. 51), and has never observed any violent outburst from Applicant in\nthe years he has known him (Tr. 51). He credited Applicant with having an even\ntemperament and the ability to maintain his composure (Tr. 51).  \nOne of Applicant\u2019s coworkers, who has known him for many years and is familiar\nwith his 2005 arrest, described him as very knowledgeable of Air Force guidelines and\nsensitive to security issues (see ex. Q; Tr. 26-29). He knows Applicant to be very\nconscientious and trustworthy, and a devoted technician who has never permitted his\n2005 incident with his mother-in-law and continued probation to adversely affect his work\n(Tr. 30).  \nApplicant\u2019s parents and sister express high regards for Applicant\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness (see exs. O and P).  His sister characterizes Applicant as a good man\nand very worthy of being awarded a security clearance. She credits him with\nconsiderable remorse for his actions and the abiding support he shows for his children\n(ex. O).  His parents (both military veterans) stress his Boy Scout and military service,\nand assure he could never be a security risk (ex. P).  \nSince April 2008, Applicant has dated a colleague he has known for over a year.\nShe describes him as honest, trustworthy, responsible, and kind (see ex. U). She credits\nhim with being a devoted father to his four children, who not only supports them\nfinancially, but spends a good deal of quality time with them. She respects him for the\ncommitments he has made to his children and his work (ex. U). \nApplicant \ndocuments \nnumerous \nmeritorious \nmedals \nand \ncertificates\ncommemorating his outstanding Air Force achievements (see exs. E through M).  He\nprovides strong character references from his colleagues and close family members who\ncredit Applicant with being a devoted father to his four children and a very trustworthy\nand conscientious professional in his work (see exs. A, O through R, S, and T). \nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a\n\n7\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of\nthe \"[c]onditions that could mitigate security concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be\nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place\nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nguidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the\ncontext of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c) \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be\nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy concerns are pertinent herein:\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and\nregulations.  AG, \u00b6 30.\nBurden of Proof\nUnder the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for\nsecurity clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires administrative\njudges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record,\nthe ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in\nlarge part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversarial\nproceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and\n\n8\nlogical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the judge cannot draw factual\ninferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR; and (2) it must demonstrate that the\nfacts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or his security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.  Because Executive Order 10865 requires that all\nsecurity clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nAnalysis\nApplicant presents as a conscientious quality assurance inspector with four minor\nchildren to support following his divorce from his wife in 2006.   \nPrincipal security issues raised in this case center on Applicant\u2019s felony assault\nconviction arising out of a domestic assault incident involving his mother-in-law and\nsentencing order which included probation that is not scheduled to expire before\nNovember 2009. \nBy itself, Applicant\u2019s 2005 felony domestic violence conviction is serious enough\nto be security-significant.  Because his mother-in-law was over 60 years of age when he\npushed her, prosecutors pursued the charges as a felony. Applicant was placed on\nprobation, though, plus one year of house arrest.  Other imposed court conditions\ncomprised anger management classes and payment of $15,000 in restitution.  By all\naccounts, Applicant has met all of the non-financial conditions and has paid most of the\nrequired restitution with his monthly payments.\nApplicable disqualifying conditions under the criminal conduct guideline include\nDC \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and DC \u00b6 31(d),\n\u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation.\u201d While there is some evidence that\nApplicant threw a chair at his wife during a heated argument in 1993, the Government\nnever alleged any criminal conduct in the SOR relative to this somewhat aged allegation,\nand the issue was never developed in the produced evidence in this record.  Based on\nthe limited evidence available, there is not enough to warrant the application of DC \u00b6\n\n9\n31(c), \u201callegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person\nwas formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d \nBefore January 2008, certain types of conduct were subject to mandatory\nprohibitions against the granting of security clearances under the Smith Amendment (10\nU.S.C. \u00a7 986), and could not be extenuated nor mitigated.   Conduct subject to the Smith\nAmendment\u2019s prohibition included convictions resulting in sentences of more than a\nyear.  However, this section of the U.S. code, which applied only to clearances granted\nby DoD, was repealed on January 28, 2008, when the President signed the National\nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 into law.   It was replaced by adding Sec.\n3002 to 50 U.S.C. \u00a7435b (the Bond Amendment), which applies throughout the Federal\ngovernment. Section 3002(c) continues the requirement of per se disqualification for\ncertain convictions and sentences. Applicant\u2019s conviction does not involve any of these\ndefined offenses, and does not fall under the Bond Amendment, as it is currently\nconstituted.\nApplicant\u2019s felony conviction, while serious, resulted in a suspended sentence for\nthe most part and was replaced with five years of probation and one year of house\narrest, plus added anger management education and restitution to his mother-in-law for\nthe hurt and medical expenses he caused her. The probation conditions ordered by the\ncourt appear clearly to reflect the court\u2019s appreciation of Applicant\u2019s emotional reaction to\nhis stepson\u2019s defiant resistance, and perhaps his mother-in-law\u2019s inappropriate\nconfrontation with Applicant over his exerted attempts to discipline his stepson.\nWithout any evidence to challenge Applicant\u2019s explanations of the underlying\nevents and circumstances surrounding his 2005 domestic conviction, the criminal\nconduct concerns that are based on this single episode of his physical push of his\nmother-in-law are entitled to some crediting of extenuating circumstances. \nApplicant may rely on MC \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal\nbehavior happened, or it happened under unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s 2005 conviction is isolated and outweighed by his substantial\nshowing of good judgment and trust demonstrated throughout his military and civilian\ncareer.  Applicant also established himself to be a responsible parent who monitored the\neducational pursuits of all of his children, including the stepson who often became\ndefiant with him when he tried to exert discipline in the presence of his mother-in-law.  \nIn the face of Applicant\u2019s persuasive showing of extenuating circumstances\nsurrounding his 2005 arrest, his responsible parenting efforts, and his impressive\nprofessional achievements in the Air Force, and in his civilian job assignments, his lone\n2005 arrest/conviction (although serious at the time the charges were filed) is not enough\nto warrant continuing security concerns about his judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. \n\n10\n Based on his own rehabilitative efforts to date (which include anger management\nclasses, permanent changes in his family environment, and almost four years of\ndemonstrated responsibility and trust with his children and with his colleagues in the\nworkplace), the chances of any recurrent domestic actions like the ones that produced\nhis 2005 conviction are highly unlikely.  Applicant may take advantage of MC \u00b6 32(d) of\nthe criminal conduct guideline, \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including\nbut not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement.\u201d\nBoth from a consideration of the applicable guidelines, and from a whole person\nperspective, Applicant demonstrates he  possesses the strength of overall character and\nrehabilitation to meet all of the minimum requirements under the criminal conduct\nguideline for continued eligibility to hold a security clearance. Applicant has a long history\nof devoted, reliable public service. \nInfluenced by the early lessons he acquired in the Boy Scouts, he contributed\nover 20 years of meritorious service to the Air Force.  And he has continued to provide\ntrusted and honored service to his civilian employer, since his Air Force retirement in\n2005. \nApplicant  maintains the confidence and trust of past and present supervisors and\nprogram managers familiar with his work and behavior within and without the work place.\nHe has completed most of his probation conditions and has less than two months\nremaining on his court-ordered probation. He has excellent performance evaluations,\nawards, and certificates that attest to his good judgment and trustworthiness during and\nafter the completion of his military career.  \nApplicant\u2019s many credits in his life should not be taken to minimize in any way the\nseriousness of his actions that resulted in his 2005 guilty plea.  Although stressed at the\ntime by the defiant behavior of his stepson and the aggressive reactions  of his mother-\nin-law, the circumstances clearly did not warrant his pushing his mother-in-law and\ncausing her to stumble and seriously injure herself.  For his actions, Applicant accepted\nresponsibility and is very remorseful.  Based on the confluence of corrective steps he\nhas taken to date, he persuasively demonstrates that he has learned important lessons\nfrom his unfortunate lapses in judgment and familial responsibilities and will work\nearnestly to avoid any recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s sister, parents, and current girlfriend bestow their high praise on him in\nrecognition of his demonstrated strong support for his children and his long and devoted\npublic service. Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances developed in the\nrecord, favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsubparagraph 1.a of the SOR.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the \u00b6 2(a) factors enumerated in the AGs.\n\n11\nFormal Findings\n   \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE J (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubpara. 1.a:\n           \nFor Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. \nClearance is granted.\n                                  \nRoger C.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn March 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 8, 2009, and elected to have the \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted \nthe Government\u2019s written case on May 4, 2009. A complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \nJune 22, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant received the FORM on May 12, 2009. He responded with a letter dated May \n28, 2009, and an attached letter from his facility security officer (FSO). Department \nCounsel did not object to his response. The letter from the FSO is marked Applicant \nExhibit (AE) A and admitted. The case was assigned to me on June 17, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He was born in \nCanada. He came to the United States in 1984 to attend school and never moved back \nto Canada. He has a Master of Science degree in engineering awarded by an American \nuniversity in 1988. He became a U.S. citizen in September 2007. He has never been \nmarried and has no children.1 \n \n \nApplicant had a Canadian passport that was issued in August 2004, and is due to \nexpire in August 2009. He retained the passport after he became a U.S. citizen for ease \nof travel to Canada. His mother, two siblings, and other extended family members still \nlive in Canada. The Canadian passport made it easier to enter Canada, and he wanted \nto keep it so that he would not have any difficulties entering the country in case of an \nemergency. He used the Canadian passport to travel to Canada after he became a U.S. \ncitizen.2  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he was a dual citizen and that he had a Canadian \npassport when he applied for his security clearance in June 2008. When he was \ninterviewed for his background investigation in July 2008, he told the investigator that he \nwas reluctant to renounce his dual citizenship with Canada. He stated that he planned \non renewing his Canadian passport when it expired. Applicant responded to DOHA \ninterrogatories in December 2008. He stated, \u201cI am not willing to destroy or surrender \nthis [Canadian] passport at this time.3 When he responded to the SOR in April 2009, \nApplicant wrote: \n \nI am willing to destroy the Canadian passport I currently possess and not \nrenew it and provide any necessary documentation or actions in support of \nthat if its possession by me precludes obtaining the Defense Personnel \nSecurity Clearance my employer is seeking.4  \n \n \nApplicant stated in his response to the FORM that he destroyed his Canadian \npassport in front of his facility security officer. He stated that he would not renew or \n                                                          \n1 Item 5. Information in this paragraph was obtained from Applicant\u2019s Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) dated June 25, 2008. \n \n2 Items 3-6. \n \n3 Id. \n \n4 Item 3. \n \n\n \n3 \n \napply for another Canadian passport and he was willing to renounce his Canadian \ncitizenship. His FSO certified that the passport was destroyed.5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n                                                          \n5 AE A. \n\n \n4 \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. One is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport. \n \nApplicant possessed and used a Canadian passport while a U.S. citizen. AG \u00b6 \n10(a) is applicable.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Preference security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 11. Three are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; and \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \n \nApplicant maintained and used his Canadian passport after becoming a U.S. \ncitizen. Because he chose to actively exercise his rights and privileges as a Canadian \ncitizen, his dual citizenship was not based solely on his parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in \nCanada. AG \u00b6 11(a) is not applicable. He was initially reluctant to give up his Canadian \npassport because he wanted the flexibility it provided to visit his family. It took some \ntime, but when Applicant finally realized that possession of a foreign passport could be \n\n \n5 \n \na concern, he destroyed the passport. He stated that he would not renew or apply for \nanother Canadian passport and he was willing to renounce his Canadian citizenship. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b) and (e) are applicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was born in Canada. He \ncame to the United States in 1984 as a young man to pursue his education and \nremained. He became a U.S. citizen in September 2007. He maintained his Canadian \ncitizenship and passport for ease of travel to Canada to visit his family. When he \nrealized that could be a concern, he destroyed the passport and stated that he would \nnot renew or apply for another Canadian passport. He is willing to renounce his \nCanadian citizenship. There are no other issues of concern. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Foreign Preference security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concern generated by his alcohol\nconsumption. Clearance is denied.\nOn April 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing a security concern under the alcohol\nconsumption guideline. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nApplicant answered the SOR on April 23, 2009, admitting all allegations. The\ncase was assigned to me on June 17, 2009. On June 23, 2009, a notice of hearing was\nissued scheduling the case for July 8, 2009. \nAugust 28, 2009\n\n2\nAt the hearing, I received six government exhibits and Applicant\u2019s testimony. The\ntranscript was received on July 16, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 53-year-old single man with a teenage daughter. Two prior\nmarriages ended in divorce. He finished high school and completed one year of college.\nFor the past 30 years, he has worked for a defense contractor that services nuclear\naircraft carriers (Tr. 11). During this time, Applicant has steadily earned promotions.\nCurrently, he is a general foreman (Tr. 18). He has held a security clearance for 30\nyears (Tr. 26).\nApplicant began drinking alcohol at age 21. Initially, he drank three beers per\nweek (Exhibit 3 at 2). By age 25, his alcohol consumption had increased to 12 beers per\nweek. By age 35, he was drinking 18 to 24 beers per week (Tr. 31). \nIn 1987, while leaving a restaurant, Applicant was stopped at a police sobriety\ncheckpoint and administered a breathalyzer (Exhibit 5 at 1). He failed, and was arrested\nand charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol (DUI) (Id.). Later, he\npleaded guilty, and was ordered to pay a fine and complete an alcohol safety action\nprogram (Id.). The course included a defensive driver\u2019s tutorial, Alcoholics Anonymous\n(AA) meetings, and group discussions. Applicant completed the course, as ordered.\nIn June 2006, the police stopped Applicant and administered a breathalyzer.\nApplicant failed, registering a blood/alcohol content of .11. He was then arrested and\ncharged with DUI (Id. at 3; Tr. 35). He pleaded guilty, paid a fine, and was ordered to\ntake a ten-week course that the state conducted. It included AA meetings twice weekly\nfor the first five weeks, and once weekly for the last five weeks (Id.). Applicant\ncompleted the course, as ordered.\nOne evening in June 2008, after a day of playing golf, Applicant went to a\nrestaurant with his friends and drank four 16-ounce glasses of beer with dinner (Tr. 40).\nAfter dinner, while driving home, he veered across the center line of the street, and was\nstopped by a police officer (Id.). Applicant was charged with DUI, found guilty, and\nsentenced to 180 days in jail with 175 days suspended. His license was suspended for\n60 days, and he was ordered to attend six months of outpatient treatment and AA\nmeetings (Tr. 41-42). \nApplicant served his jail time on consecutive weekends (Tr. 41). As for the\noutpatient treatment, the plan originally included group counseling and AA attendance\nonce per week. The counseling center increased these meetings to two times per week\nafter his intake assessment revealed a level of alcohol in his system that indicated more\nrecent consumption than he had reported (Exhibit 6 at 2).\nBy March 2009, Applicant had successfully completed the treatment program,\nattending all but one counseling session and passing all of the random alcohol tests (Tr.\n\n3\n42). His case manager ruled out alcohol dependence and diagnosed him with alcohol\nabuse (Exhibit 6 at 3).\nThe court restored Applicant\u2019s license after 60 days, as anticipated. As of the\ndate of the hearing, his license remained restricted (Tr. 47). Specifically, he can only\ndrive to and from work, medical appointments, or to exercise visitation rights with his\ndaughter. The restriction was set to expire on August 4, 2009.\nCurrently, Applicant continues to drink, but only consumes four beers per week\non weekends (Tr. 45). He no longer drinks to the point of intoxication (Tr. 46). He\ncontends that his alcohol consumption had begun gradually decreasing by 1999. He has\nno intention of drinking and driving again (Tr. 53).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nUnder this guideline, \u201cexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise\nof questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness\u201d (AG \u00b6 21). Applicant\u2019s history of\n\n4\nexcessive alcohol and DUIs triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related\nincidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence . . . regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d and 22\n(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent.\u201d \nThe government established that the case manager was an employee of a\nsubstance abuse services facility. Absent record evidence of the meaning of the\nacronyms \u201cMAC, NCC\u201d following her signature on the letter summarizing Applicant\u2019s\ntreatment history, I cannot infer, however, that the case manager is either a licensed\nclinician or a qualified medical professional. Consequently, I did not apply either AG \u00b6\n22(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical\npsychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence,\u201d or AG \u00b6 22(e),\n\u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a\nstaff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\u201d\nApplicant successfully completed an outpatient treatment program. He has\nreduced his alcohol consumption to four beers per week, a responsible amount. He no\nlonger drinks alcohol before driving, and, more importantly, appears to have internalized\nan understanding of the inherent danger of drinking and driving. As of the hearing date,\nApplicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was still restricted. Consequently, it is too soon to conclude\nthat AG \u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d applies.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s reduced alcohol consumption and the insight he has gained from\nhis participation in alcohol counseling are sufficient to establish AG \u00b6 23(b), \u201cthe\nindividual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides\nevidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of\nabstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d\nThe program that Applicant recently completed is the first formal, comprehensive\nalcohol treatment that he has received. Past alcohol interventions were less intensive\nand focused on education rather than treatment. Consequently, AG \u00b6 23(c), \u201cthe\nindividual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or treatment\nprogram, has no history of previous treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory\nprogress,\u201d is inapplicable because it is not relevant to the facts of this case.\nBased upon the case manager\u2019s letter, Applicant was doing a good job of\ncomplying with the treatment program. However, when the letter was prepared,\nApplicant had six more weeks of treatment to complete before discharge. Although he\ntestified credibly that he completed the course satisfactorily, he produced no discharge\nsummary from the treatment center. Consequently, I cannot conclude that AG \u00b6 23(d),\n\u201cthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or\nrehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and\nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment\n\n5\nrecommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a\nsimilar organization, and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical\nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized\nalcohol treatment program,\u201d applies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant testified credibly, and had an impressive demeanor. He deserves credit\nfor holding a security clearance for 30 years. He appears to have gained a deeper\nappreciation of the tenuous threshold between occasionally drinking too much beer with\nfriends at social outings, and having an alcohol problem. Recognizing the risk\nassociated with occasional overconsumption, he has chosen never to drink to the point\nof intoxication.\nThe state court\u2019s issuance of a restriction upon Applicant\u2019s driving privileges is a\nsignificant factor. Implicit in the imposition of such a restriction is the concern that\nApplicant would pose a public safety risk if allowed to operate his automobile freely.\nThis restriction was scheduled to be released after the ISCR hearing. Also, given the\nrepetitive nature of the DUIs, not enough time has elapsed to conclude that he will\nsustain his modified drinking pattern. Consequently, it is too soon to conclude that\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol consumption no longer poses a security concern.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On June 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn July 2, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have the \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On July 15, 2009, Department \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nCounsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing nine Items, and he \nmailed Applicant a complete copy the following day. Applicant received the FORM on \nJuly 22, 2009, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and submit additional \ninformation. Applicant submitted a statement on August 20, 2009.

(AE 1) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts accrued between 2002 and 2006. He attributes \nthem to several factors: a remote year-long tour to Korea, another five-month \ndeployment, a decrease in his housing allowance, and his wife\u2019s failure to properly \nmanage their money while he was gone. In October 2007, he was in a motorcycle \naccident and then placed on a short term disability, further diminishing his income. (AE \n1)  \n \n \n \nIn February 2008, Applicant completed a set of Interrogatories regarding \ndelinquent debts and subsequently discussed his finances with a government \ninvestigator. (Item 8) He disclosed that his net monthly income is $6,953 and expenses \nare $2,800, including his rent. He makes monthly payments of $2,150 on financial \nobligations and debts, including delinquent accounts. He has approximately $2,000 \nremaining at the end of the month. (Item 8) He and his wife are attempting to investigate \nand resolve their financial problems. (AE 1) He has not received any financial \ncounseling or engaged any debt consolidation services. He thinks his financial situation \nis manageable. (Item 8 at 5) \n \n \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR), dated March 2007, February 2008, and \nOctober 2008, Paragraph 1 of the SOR alleges five delinquent debts, totaling $47,751, \nwhich accrued from late 2002 through the middle of 2008. (Items 5, 6, 7) The status of \nthe debts is as follows: \n \n1. Applicant admitted owing the $118 medical debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He \nbelieves it should be paid by the motorist who hit him in October 2007. (Item 3 \nat 3) He has been trying to resolve it since February 2009. (Item 8 at 2) It \nremains unresolved. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n2. Applicant admitted owing the $1,300 department store debt listed in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b. In February 2009, he said he was contacting the company about it. (Item \n8 at 3) He said that he paid it in 2007, but did not supply any proof of \npayment. (Item 3 at 3) \n \n3. Applicant denied owing the $21,954 credit card debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He is \nunfamiliar with the account. (Item 3 at 3) In February 2009, he said his wife \nwas working with the credit reporting bureau, but had not contacted the \ncreditor. (Item 8 at 3) It remains unresolved. \n \n4. Applicant denied owing the $10,698 credit card debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He is \nunfamiliar with the account. (Item 3 at 3) In February 2009, he said his wife \nwas working with the credit reporting bureau, but had not contacted the \ncreditor. (Item 9 at 4) It remains unresolved. \n \n5. Applicant acknowledged the $13,681 credit card listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e. (Item 3 \nat 3) He said that he paid the debt off in May 2009, but did not submit any \nevidence of payment.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \n\n \n4 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7 of \nExecutive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a) an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying. \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c) Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Based on three CBRs and his statements, Applicant has been \nunable or unwilling to satisfy debts that began accruing in 2002. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise these two potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter the Government raised potential disqualifications, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to rebut and prove mitigation. The guideline includes examples of conditions \nthat could mitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), \nthe disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.@ Applicant\u2019s multiple financial problems arose six to seven years ago, and \n\n \n5 \n \n \ncontinued accruing into 2008. Because the problems are ongoing and not isolated, this \ncondition does not apply.   \n \nAG & 20(b) states that mitigation can occur when Athe conditions that resulted in \nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant \nattributed his financial delinquencies to periods of deployment, decreased income, and \na period of disability. Those were circumstances beyond his control. However, he did \nnot offer any evidence that he attempted to responsibly manage the debts as they were \naccruing, which is necessary to support the full application of this condition.  \n \nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant did not obtain credit counseling or \nsubmit proof that his financial problems are under control, as required under AG & \n20(c). Hence, it does not apply. AG & 20(d) applies when the evidence shows that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ Applicant asserted that he paid two debts, but he did not provide evidence of \nsuch payment. Based on his service history and candid remarks throughout the record, I \nfind his statements credible regarding the debts listed in SOR \u00b6 1. b ($1,300) and SOR \n1 \u00b6 1.e ($13,681). Hence, AG & 20(d) applies to those two, but not the other three debts \nthat remain unpaid or unresolved. He denied owning the three debts, but did not \nproduce documentation indicating that he successfully disputed the debts. Such \nevidence is necessary to trigger mitigation under AG & 20(e), which applies when \u201cthe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d  \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 44 years old and \nhonorably served this country in the military for 20 years. He has worked for a defense \ncontractor for the past five years and has held a security clearance since 1985. In \nFebruary 2009, the Government sent him a set of Interrogatories, alerting him to \nfinancial delinquencies that could adversely affect his security clearance. In his \nresponse to the Interrogatories, he said that he and his wife would be resolving some of \nthe debts, particularly those that were unknown to him. In June 2009, he received the \nSOR, detailing the specific debts in question. In mid-July 2009, he received the FORM, \nnotifying him that he had an additional 30 days to respond and submit documentary \nevidence pertinent to his debts. Despite having six months to investigate and address \nthe Government\u2019s concerns, he took no action on three of the alleged debtst. His failure \nto responsibly respond to those concerns calls into question his judgment and reliability. \nGiven his long military history and previous experience with the security clearance \nprocess, I find it troubling that he did not take more aggressive steps to address all of \nthe Government\u2019s specific concerns when he learned of them.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nissues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:                                    \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

There is evidence\nthat the Applicant disputed this debt to the credit reporting agencies, but he did not\nsubmit the result of this dispute. (Item 5 at 6.) Based on all of the available evidence, I\nfind that this debt has not been paid.\n1.b.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a credit union in the amount of\n$8,510 for a vehicle repossession. (Item 5 at 7; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 12.) This debt has\nnot been paid.\n1.c.  The Applicant denies that he is indebted to a department store in the\namount  of $3,539. Credit reports dated March 18, 2008 (Item 7 at 14), and February\n12, 2009 (Item 6 at 2), support the existence of this debt. The Applicant submitted no\ninformation in support of his denial. Based on all of the available evidence, I find that\nthis debt has not been paid.\n1.d.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a loan company in the amount of\n$2,042.  (Item 5 at 7; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 8.) This debt has not been paid.\n1.e.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to another loan company in the\namount of $3,396. (Item 5 at 7; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 10.) This debt has not been paid.\n1.f.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a third loan company in the past\ndue amount of at least $627 as of February 12, 2009.  (Item 5 at 6; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at\n5.) This debt has not been paid.\n\n3\n1.g.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a bank in the past due amount of\nat least $233 as of February 12, 2009.  (Item 5 at 6; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 5.) This debt\nhas not been paid.\n1.h.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a collection agency in the\namount of $6,689. (Item 7 at 6.) This debt has not been paid.\n1.i.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a bank in the past due amount of\nat least $28.  (Item 5 at 6; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 7.) This debt has not been paid.\n1.j.  The Applicant denies that he is indebted to a credit union in the amount of\n$10,746 for a past due automobile loan. The Applicant provided a copy of the title to the\nautomobile, showing that the credit union released their lien in October 2007.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 3.) Based on all of the available evidence, I find that the\nApplicant has paid this debt. This subparagraph is found for the Applicant.\n1.k.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a fourth loan company in the\ncharged off amount of $5,673. (Item 5 at 7; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 10.) This debt has not\nbeen paid.\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own common sense,\nas well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise\nsecurity concerns. The Applicant, by his own admission, has approximately $30,000 in\npast due debts, all of which have been due and owing for several years. The evidence\nis sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\n\n5\nmay be mitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial difficulties arose primarily after 2002.  He submitted evidence showing that he\npaid off a substantial debt concerning his automobile, but has not submitted any\nevidence showing that he has paid any of the other debts. The fact that the rest of the\ndebts have been due and owing for so long is troubling. This mitigating condition is not\napplicable to this case. \nThe Applicant submitted no evidence showing that AG \u00b6 20(b) is applicable. That\ncondition states it may be mitigating where, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d\nThe Applicant has not initiated a good-faith effort to pay off his creditors. There is\nno track record of his making payments for a consistent period of time.  Accordingly, AG\n\u00b6 20(d) is not applicable. Finally, given the fact that he is approximately $30,000.00 in\ndebt, I cannot find that \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or\nis under control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c).\nBased on all of the available evidence, I cannot find that the Applicant has\nmitigated the allegations under this Guideline.  Paragraph 1 is found against the\nApplicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a) in making such a decision: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant has a history of not\npaying his debts.  As set forth above, I cannot find that there have been permanent\n\n6\nbehavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  In addition, I find that there is the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and that there is a likelihood of\nrecurrence (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude the\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On April 10, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\n\n2\nrequested a hearing.  On August 17, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Erin C. Hogan\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are supported by substantial record evidence; whether the Judge\u2019s application of the pertinent\nmitigating conditions is erroneous; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an executive for a\nfederal contractor.  He has previously worked for another federal contractor after retiring as an\nofficer in the U.S. Air Force.  He has held a security clearance for 30 years.\nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts for such things as medical bills, credit cards, and\na real estate mortgage.  His second marriage ended in divorce in 2006.  The two were having\nfinancial problems during their marriage.  The divorce decree required Applicant to pay child and\nspousal support.  These obligations were still in effect at the close of the record.  Applicant filed for\nChapter 7 bankruptcy protection, but the petition was dismissed because his income exceeded the\nfiling threshold.  In the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge noted the effect which Applicant\u2019s\ndivorce had exerted on his financial condition, his employment history, and his having held a\nsecurity clearance for 30 years.  However, she concluded  that Applicant had not taken adequate\nsteps to resolve his financial problems until recently, which impugned his good judgement and\nreliability.\nApplicant contended that the Judge\u2019s factual findings contain errors.  For example, he\nchallenged the Judge\u2019s statement that Applicant had experienced financial problems at the end of\nhis second marriage.  However, after reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s\nmaterial findings are based on substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or\ninferences that could be drawn from the record.  In particular, Applicant\u2019s divorce decree, admitted\nas Applicant Exhibit F, supports the Judge\u2019s statement about Applicant\u2019s financial condition.\nApplicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the case.  Considering\nthe record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are sustainable.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd.

The Board cannot consider this new evidence.\nSee Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal Board\u201d).\nSee also ISCR Case No. 08-06518 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 3, 2009).  Applicant\u2019s appeal points to his\ngood security record, which the Judge noted in her decision.  This does not demonstrate that the\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The federal government need not wait until an\napplicant actually mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before it can deny or revoke\naccess to such information.  See Adams v.

Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old vice president of operations with a Department of \nDefense contractor seeking to maintain his security clearance. He has been employed \nwith this company since June 2009. Prior to accepting this position, he worked for 12 \nyears as a senior program manager for another defense contractor. From October 1977 \nto January 1, 1998, he served on active duty in the United States Air Force. He retired \nas a Lieutenant Colonel. He has held a security clearance for over 30 years with no \nsecurity violations. He has been married three times. He and his second wife had four \nchildren, ages 24, 23, 22 and 19. They separated in March 2003 and were divorced in \nMarch 2006. He remarried in June 2008. (Tr at 4-7, 33-34, 56; Gov 1; AE A)  \n \nOn March 26, 2008, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) in order to apply for a security clearance. A \nsubsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant has financial issues. The \nSOR alleges 12 delinquent accounts totaling approximately $59,078. Of that amount, \n$34,054 is related to a second mortgage on a home that was foreclosed, and $15,038 is \nthe amount owed after Applicant\u2019s ex-wife surrendered her car to the dealer during the \ndivorce.   \n \nApplicant had financial problems during the end of his second marriage. His \ndivorce decree indicates Applicant and his second wife owed federal income taxes for \ntax years 2002 and 2003 as well as state income taxes for tax year 2001. The total \namount owed was $8,600. Applicant has paid the back taxes. (AE F at 2) The back \ntaxes owed are not alleged in the SOR but are relevant with regard to Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial history. \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant stated that at the time of his separation \nfrom his second wife, they owned two properties in two different states. At the time of \nseparation, all bills and home loan mortgage payments were current. In 2004 per court \norder, he began paying $5,382 per month total in spousal support ($2,951) and child \nsupport ($2,431). The temporary support order held him responsible for one of the \nmortgage payments in the amount of $1,528, a $377 debt, and his $687 truck payment. \nHis wife was responsible for the remaining bills, which amounted to $4,177. His wife \nstopped making payments on the bills in 2005 when she decided to move to another \n\n \n3 \n \n \nstate where her childhood home was located. Ultimately, both homes owned by \nApplicant and his second wife went to foreclosure. (Answer to SOR) \n \n In late 2005, Applicant and his second wife reached a court settlement. The \njudge recommended both Applicant and his wife file for bankruptcy. His second wife \nfiled for Chapter 7 bankruptcy during the same timeframe of the divorce. The divorce \ndecree mentions that Applicant intended to file for bankruptcy as well due to the \nsubstantial debts of the marriage. (See AE F)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s divorce was final in March 2006 and the temporary support order \nbecame final. Applicant was ordered by the court to continue to pay $2,951 in monthly \nspousal support and $2,431 in monthly child support. Spousal support payments end on \nJune 18, 2010. The child support payment remains the same until Applicant\u2019s youngest \nchild reaches age 21 or June 29, 2011. (Gov 2 at 4; AE F at 16-21) He also agreed to \nbe responsible for a $1,528 mortgage payment, a $377 second mortgage payment and \na $687 payment for his truck. He agreed to let his daughter use a car which is titled in \nhis name. He agreed to make the $425 monthly car payments until she turns 21. (AE F \nat 5-6, 20-21) \n \nAlthough not legally required to pay under the terms of the divorce agreement, \nApplicant gives his daughter $200 a month to help with her student loan payments. He \npaid his daughter\u2019s monthly rent, $435 a month, when she was in college. He pays his \n19-year-old son\u2019s truck payment which is $440 a month. The court-ordered monthly \nsupport obligations as well as the additional voluntary payments to his children made it \ndifficult for him to meet his monthly expenses.  (Tr at 29-30, 32, 35; Gov 2 at 2)  \n \nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on October 5, 2007. He listed total \nassets of $372,200. He listed total liabilities of $414,913. His non-priority unsecured \ndebt totaled $88,913. Most of the unsecured debts were credit cards (19 credit card \naccounts). His gross monthly income was listed as $14,059.21. His net monthly income \nwas $10,005. His annual income was listed as $168,710.52. On January 10, 2008, the \nbankruptcy court dismissed the case for abuse because Applicant earned too much \nincome to meet the threshold of filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (Gov 5) A recent \nchange in the bankruptcy law made it more restrictive to file under Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nat the time Applicant filed.  \n \nAfter the Chapter 7 bankruptcy was dismissed, Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy attorney \nadvised him to wait for the creditors to contact him and he could deal with them on an \nindividual basis. (Tr at 28) \n \nIn his written closing statement provided during the hearing, Applicant stated that \nhis priorities since his separation and divorce from his second wife has been the well-\nbeing of his children.  From August 2005 to July 2007, he paid an additional $650 a \nmonth to pay for his daughter\u2019s room and board at college. He admits this priority has \ndelayed his financial recovery. He comments: \u201cIf asked why I would risk my livelihood, \n\n \n4 \n \n \nmy response is that I don\u2019t want my children starting out life with a huge debt from a \ncollege loan note.\u201d (AE E)  \n \nThe current status of the delinquent accounts are: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, $118 medical account placed for collection in July 2007. Paid as of \nApril 2009. (Tr at 39; AE G at 3; Gov 4 at 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c, $260 medical account placed for collection in January 2008. Paid as \nof July 22, 2009.

(Tr at 40, Gov 2 at \n6; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 3; AE B) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e, $1,195 credit card account that was charged off in December 2003. \nThe account has not been resolved. Applicant has not contacted the company for \nseveral years. (Tr at 41-42; Gov 2 at 6; Gov 3 at 1-2; Gov 4 at 4; AE B; AE G at 2) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f, $1,561 department store credit card account that was charged off in \nAugust 2004. Applicant claims the account was paid.  After the hearing, he provided a \nletter, dated July 27, 2009, indicating he formally disputed the account with the credit \nreporting agencies. (Tr at 44; Gov 2 at 6; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 8, 15; AE G at 6) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g, $2,611 credit card account that was charged off in November 2003. \nApplicant has made no efforts to pay this account because it is charged off. He has not \ncontacted the company in years. Debt unresolved. (Tr at 42-43; Gov 2 at 6; Gov 3 at 2; \nAE B; AE G at 2) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h, $15,038 amount owed after ex-wife\u2019s automobile repossessed during \nthe divorce. Date of last action on the account was November 2002. Applicant settled \nfor $4,537. Debt paid with a credit card. (Tr at 44-45; Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 13, 15; AE B; \nAE G at 8-9) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i, $1,952 account that was charged off in March 2003. Applicant claims \nthis account successfully disputed with credit reporting agencies. No proof submitted at \nthe close of the record. (Tr at 46; Gov 2 at 6; Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 5; AE B; AE G at 2) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j, $34,054 second mortgage, home foreclosure that was charged off in \nApril 2005. Applicant claims the home was foreclosed and resold. At the hearing, he \nwas not aware if he owed any money on the second mortgage as a result of the sale. \nAfter the hearing, Applicant contacted his attorney. His attorney told him that the state \nlaw where the home was located indicates that all debts are cleared upon repossession. \nHis attorney is contacting the company who owned the second mortgage to obtain a \nletter that the company will not pursue further actions against Applicant. (Tr at 47; Gov 3 \nat 3; Gov 4 at 7, 15; AE B; AE G at 2) \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k, $368 cable bill placed for collection in April 2005. Debt was resolved. \n(Tr at 49; Gov 2 at 7; Gov 4 at 14; AE D)     \n  \nSOR \u00b6 1.l, $348 account placed for collection in June 2007. Applicant claims the \ndebt was paid. No receipt was provided. Post hearing submission indicates he is in the \nprocess of removing the entry from his credit report. (Tr at 49; Gov 2 at 7; Gov 4 at 15; \nAE G at 2) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m, $1,237 account placed for collection in May 2005. Applicant intends \nto dispute this account. On July 27, 2009, he formally disputed the account with the \ncredit reporting agencies. (Tr at 49; Gov 2 at 7; Gov 4 at 16; AE B; AE G at 10) \n \nIn response to interrogatories, Applicant provided a copy of monthly budget \ndated February 3, 2009. He listed his net monthly salary as $7,303.05. His Air Force \nmonthly retirement income is $3,503. His total net monthly income is $10,806. His \ncurrent wife\u2019s net monthly income is $2,549. Their total net monthly income is $13,355. \nTheir monthly expenses total $11,435.47. After expenses, they have approximately \n$1,920 left over each month for discretionary spending. (Gov 2 at 5) During the hearing, \nApplicant indicated that his income has decreased about a $1,000 each month with his \nnew job. (Tr at 50)  \n \nIn February 2009, Applicant and his current wife purchased a home. Applicant \nwas unable to qualify for a mortgage because of his poor credit history. He borrowed \napproximately $170,000 from a personal friend and business associate in order to \npurchase the home. (Tr at 54) \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant provided a chronology of his 30-year history of \nholding a security clearance.  The chronology includes his Air Force career and his \ncareer as a defense contractor. (AE A)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n\n \n6 \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); and FC DC \u00b6 19(e) (consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, \nwhich may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high \ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant \nencountered financial difficulties as early as 2001. He and his second wife owed state \nincome taxes for 2001 and federal income taxes for tax years 2002 and 2003. The two \nhomes they owned went to foreclosure at the time of the divorce. Schedule E of his \nbankruptcy listed $88,913 in unsecured debts. While Applicant claims the debts were \nbeing paid prior to separating from his second wife, the amount of their unsecured debt \nindicates that they were spending beyond their means and headed towards financial \nissues regardless of whether they stayed together or separated. The SOR alleged 12 \ndelinquent accounts, an approximate total balance of $59,078. \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005)).  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. \nApplicant has had financial problems for several years. He recently started to resolve \nseveral of his delinquent accounts. At the close of the record, he provided proof that \nfour of the delinquent accounts were resolved. However, eight accounts remained \nunresolved at the close of the record. Applicant is still in the midst of his financial \nproblems. Applicant\u2019s failure to address his financial issues raises questions about his \nreliability and good judgment.    \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part, due to Applicant\u2019s divorce \nwhich accelerated Applicant\u2019s financial problems. The second prong of this mitigating \ncondition asks whether the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.  After \nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy was dismissed, he did nothing to resolve his \ndelinquent accounts for years. Although, he claims that his attorney advised him to \npassively wait until the creditors contacted him, considering his extensive history of \nholding a security clearance, he should have recognized a potential security concern \nwas raised pertaining to his finances. He had options. He could have filed for \nbankruptcy under Chapter 13. He could have consulted with a credit counseling agency \n\n \n8 \n \n \nto establish a plan to resolve his debts. He chose to ignore his delinquent debt until he \ndiscovered that it may have an adverse effect on his security clearance. \n \n \nInstead of resolving his delinquent financial obligations, he used the money that \nshould have been applied towards his debts to pay his daughter\u2019s car payment and her \nrent while she was in college. He continues to pay her $200 a month to apply towards \nher college loans. He pays his youngest son\u2019s car payment of $440 a month.  While it is \nunderstandable that Applicant wants to support to his children, it was poor judgment to \ndo so at the expense of his other financial obligations. Cars are luxuries as opposed to \nnecessities. I cannot conclude Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nFor this reason, FC MC \u00b6 20(b) is given less weight.   \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant has not attended financial counseling. While Applicant \nresolved some accounts, the majority of the delinquent accounts remain unresolved.   \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.h, and 1.k.  However, the remaining debts are unresolved. Applicant has \nhad no contact for several years with many of his creditors. Eight of the accounts \nremain unresolved at the close of the record. Applicant took no steps to resolve many of \nthe accounts until after he learned they would be a security issue. Overall, Applicant has  \nnot made a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent accounts.  \n \nFC MC \u00b620(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) does not apply. Although at the close of the record, Applicant provided evidence \nthat he formally disputed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, I.i, 1.l, and 1.m, the status of \nApplicant\u2019s disputes are pending. It is premature to conclude there is a reasonable basis \nto dispute the legitimacy of the debts.  \n \nWhile Applicant encountered financial problems as a result of his divorce, he \nignored his delinquent debts after his Chapter 7 bankruptcy was dismissed. He did not \nbegin to resolve his delinquent accounts until recently. He had the income to resolve the \ndelinquent debts but chose to provide extra support to his children. While one can \nunderstand a parent\u2019s desire to provide support to their children, it was irresponsible to \nignore his other financial obligations. Most of the delinquent accounts remain \nunresolved. It is too soon to conclude that he has mitigated the concerns raised under \nGuideline F.    \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n9 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s 20 years of \nhonorable service as an Air Force officer. I considered his 12-year employment history \nwith defense contractors. I considered his 30-year history of holding a security \nclearance. I considered the financial problems which occurred during his second \nmarriage which were aggravated by his separation and divorce. I considered the large \namount of court-ordered spousal and child support payments. However, having been \nentrusted with a security clearance for over 30 years, Applicant should have been \naware that his financial situation would raise a security concern. His divorce was final in \nMarch 2006. He ignored his delinquent debts for years. He did not take steps to honor \nhis financial obligations until recently. While there is some mitigation in this case, \nApplicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  He did not mitigate the concerns raised under financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interests to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nCarl E. Maas, Personal Representative\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 10, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are supported by substantial record evidence; whether the Judge\u2019s application of the pertinent\nmitigating conditions is erroneous; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n2\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an executive for a\nfederal contractor.  He has previously worked for another federal contractor after retiring as an\nofficer in the U.S. Air Force.  He has held a security clearance for 30 years.\nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts for such things as medical bills, credit cards, and\na real estate mortgage.  His second marriage ended in divorce in 2006.  The two were having\nfinancial problems during their marriage.  The divorce decree required Applicant to pay child and\nspousal support.  These obligations were still in effect at the close of the record.  Applicant filed for\nChapter 7 bankruptcy protection, but the petition was dismissed because his income exceeded the\nfiling threshold.  In the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge noted the effect which Applicant\u2019s\ndivorce had exerted on his financial condition, his employment history, and his having held a\nsecurity clearance for 30 years.  However, she concluded  that Applicant had not taken adequate\nsteps to resolve his financial problems until recently, which impugned his good judgement and\nreliability.\nApplicant contended that the Judge\u2019s factual findings contain errors.  For example, he\nchallenged the Judge\u2019s statement that Applicant had experienced financial problems at the end of\nhis second marriage.  However, after reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s\nmaterial findings are based on substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or\ninferences that could be drawn from the record.  In particular, Applicant\u2019s divorce decree, admitted\nas Applicant Exhibit F, supports the Judge\u2019s statement about Applicant\u2019s financial condition.\nApplicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the case.  Considering\nthe record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are sustainable.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).  \nIn support of his appeal, Applicant has provided new evidence not contained in the record,\nincluding evidence that he had paid off certain debts.  The Board cannot consider this new evidence.\nSee Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal Board\u201d).\nSee also ISCR Case No. 08-06518 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 3, 2009).  Applicant\u2019s appeal points to his\ngood security record, which the Judge noted in her decision.  This does not demonstrate that the\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The federal government need not wait until an\napplicant actually mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before it can deny or revoke\naccess to such information.  See Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969).  The\nabsence of security violations does not bar or preclude an adverse security clearance decision.  See\nISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005).  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued\nafter September 1, 2006.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 15, 2009, and requested a hearing.  The\ncase was assigned to me on July 1, 2009, and was scheduled for hearing on October 22,\n2009.  A hearing was held on the scheduled date for the purpose of considering whether\nit would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke\nFebruary 22, 2010\n\n2\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance. At the hearing, the Government's case consisted of six\nexhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and no exhibits.  The transcript (Tr.)\nwas received on October 29, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access classified information is denied.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) accumulated 17 debts\nexceeding $14,000 and (b) petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in October 2003\n(discharged in January 2004).\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his Electronic\nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) by omitting his debts over 180 days\ndelinquent, and currently 90 days delinquent.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the alleged debts and\nomissions in his e-QIP.  He claimed he paid the creditor identified in \u00b6 1.a.  He  claimed\nhe attempted a settlement with one of his creditors (creditor 1.b) and was paying on\nseveral more: creditors 1.d through 1.g, 1.k, 1.m, and 1.n.  He explained that the debts\nidentified in \u00b6 1.h and 1.p  are duplications of \u00b6 1.g. and 1.b, respectively. And he\nclaimed he was not able to complete repayment agreements with creditors 1.I, 1.j, and\n1.o.\n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 52-year-old systems maintenance engineer for a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant married his first spouse in February 1986, and divorced her ten years\nlater in August 1996 (ex. 1).  He has no children from this marriage.  Applicant currently\nshares a residence with a girlfriend (Tr. 28-29).\nFor most of the 1980s and 1990s, Applicant worked for defense contractors and\nhad a  security clearance.  Between 2001 and 2007, he experienced two major layoffs\n(2001-2003 and 2006-2007) that affected his ability to pay his debts (Tr. 23, 25-27).\nDuring these lengthy layoffs, he received unemployment compensation, but no\nseverance packages from his employers (Tr. 28).  \nUnable to fashion a plan to repay his debts, Applicant petitioned for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy relief in October 2003.  In his Chapter 7 petition, he scheduled approximately\n$41,000 in unsecured claims (see ex .1; Tr. 29). His unsecured claims included a\nnumber of credit card debts stemming from charges he accumulated while unemployed\nbetween 2001 and 2003 (Tr. 30).\n\n3\nApplicant has never received any financial counseling (save for the occasional\ninformal counseling he received at work) and has no current plan to repay the delinquent\ndebts he accrued since his 2004 Chapter 7 discharge.  Currently, he pays $120 a month\nto a debt consolidation company to cover several of his debts, but provides no\ndocumentation of the debts being addressed (Tr. 54).  \nApplicant assures that he does not have sufficient income to address all of his\ndelinquent debts and is actively looking for a higher paying job (Tr. 32-33). To date,\nApplicant has provided no documentation of any contacts with his listed creditors, and\nhas no tangible plan to address his debts (Tr. 51).  He claims to have paid on several of\nhis listed creditors (creditors 1.d, 1.m, and creditor 1.n), but provided no documentary\nproof (Tr. 36-508).\nApplicant nets about $2,000 a month from his work and struggles every month\njust to meet his expenses (Tr.  51). He estimates his monthly expenses to exceed $1,500\n(Tr. 52-54).  He has no 401(k) retirement program, life insurance, or other assets (Tr.\n55). Nor does he have any alimony or child support obligations.  He could provide no\nestimate of when he could begin paying down his accumulated delinquent debts.\nAsked to complete an e-QIP in February 2008, Applicant omitted his accrued\ndebts that were over 180 days delinquent when answering question 28.  He also omitted\nhis debts that were then over 90 days delinquent (see ex. 1; Tr. 60-61).  He provided no\nexplanations for his answers either when afforded an opportunity to do so in section 30\nof the e-QIP (see ex. 1).  \nApplicant admitted to recognizing the debt question, and his need to answer in the\naffirmative to the question, but skipped the question and never returned to the debt\nquestion (Tr. 60-62).  Applicant attributed his omissions to haste and oversight (Tr. 61-\n63). He indicated he believed he completed the e-QIP section covering financial\ninformation, only to discover later that he had not (Tr. 63-64).  \nIn July 2008, an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\ninterviewed Applicant.  In opening the interview for discussion of Applicant\u2019s delinquent\ndebts, the investigator showed Applicant a credit report and proceeded to go over each\nof the debts listed in the report with Applicant.  He acknowledged the listed debts as his\nown when asked about them by the investigator.  Conversely, he answered \u201cno\u201d to those\nreported debts he did not recognize (see ex. 1; Tr. 65). He admitted to recognizing the\ndebt questions, and his need to answer in the affirmative to the questions, but skipped\nthe question and never returned to the debt question (Tr. 65-66). \nApplicant\u2019s explanations for his debt omissions are plausible, but not entirely\ncompatible with his educational and work skills. His hesitation in affirmatively\nacknowledging his delinquent debts is better explained by his inferred natural reluctance\nto supply negative information about his finances. Without more to corroborate his\nexplanations, his answers are not sufficient to avert drawn inferences of knowing and\nwilful omission. \n\n4\nWhen interviewed by an OPM investigator five months later, Applicant\u2019s\nacknowledged the omitted debts only after being confronted by the agent with a credit\nreport (see exs. 2-6; Tr. 66-68).  His answers, while truthful when made, were neither\nprompt nor voluntarily provided the OPM investigator as those term are generally\nunderstood to mean. \nApplicant did not provide any endorsements or performance evaluations.  These\nmight have been helpful to demonstrating his overall reliability and trustworthiness.  As it\nis, not enough is known about Applicant to credit him with any supporting character and\nwork-related job assessments.  \nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making\nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could\ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as considerations\nthat could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the \"[c]onditions\nthat could mitigate security concerns,\u201d if any. These guidelines must be considered\nbefore deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or\ndenied.  Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the\nenumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a\ndecision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent\nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in 2(a) of the AGs,\nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense\ndecision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context\nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period\nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the\napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct: (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent herein:\n\n5\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. AG, \u00b6 18.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG \u00b6 15.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the revised AGs, a decision to\ngrant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence. See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 792-800\n(1988).  As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely,\nthe judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\n\n6\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the\nultimate burden of demonstrating his clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis\nApplicant is a respected employee of a defense contractor who accumulated\ndelinquent debts during recurrent periods of unemployment and work in low-paying\njobs. Since his Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2004, he has incurred additional\ndebt delinquencies, which he has yet to address. Claiming he made payments on\nsome of his listed accounts through an identified debt consolidation firm, he provided\nno documentation of any debt payments or contacts with any of his creditors.\n When asked about his omissions of his listed delinquent debts in the e-QIP  he\nexecuted in 2008, Applicant knowingly and willfully omitted his listed debts. Applicant\u2019s\nunaddressed delinquent debts and e-QIP omissions raise security concerns under\nGuidelines F and E, respectively.\nApplicant\u2019s finances\nApplicant\u2019s pleading admissions of the debts covered in the SOR negate the\nneed for any independent proof (see McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 (3d ed. 1984)).\nEach of his listed debts are fully documented in his latest credit reports and provide\nample independent proof of his debts. Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts\nand his past inability to pay, or otherwise address these debts in a systematic fashion, \nwarrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines:\nDC \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and DC \u00b619(c)) \u201ca history of\nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nWith his limited repayment history and lack of a tangible plan to resolve his\nlisted debts without higher paying work, Applicant cannot be credited with any visible\nprogress to date in regaining control of his finances. To date, he has made no\ndocumented payments to any of the creditors listed in the SOR, and faces potential\ncollection action on some of them. \nBased on his evidentiary showing of recurrent unemployment and\nunderemployment conditions, Applicant\u2019s proofs are sufficient to establish  some\nextenuating circumstances associated with his debt accumulations.  As a result, MC  \u00b6\n20(b) of the financial considerations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\n\n7\nseparation, and the individual acted responsibly,\u201d has some application to Applicant\u2019s\ncircumstances. \nHowever, Applicant has failed to demonstrate he has addressed his most\nrecent delinquent accounts in any manifest way, and, as a result, cannot fully invoke\nany of the mitigating benefits of MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d and MC \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person\nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d\nBecause of his recurrent periods of unemployment, Applicant\u2019s inability to make\nany major inroads in resolving his delinquent debts is somewhat understandable. Full\nmitigation credit is not available to him, however, based on the facts of this case.\nNeither Applicant\u2019s oral nor written evidence reflect any significant voluntary\nrepayment efforts on any of his incurred delinquent debts since his emergence from a\nChapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2004.  His repayment promises lack any tangible\nrepayment plan and appear to be wholly contingent on his obtaining work that pays\nhim more than what he is currently earning with his present employer.  His efforts to\ndate are not enough to warrant full application of any of the mitigating conditions\ncovered in the financial guideline.\nMoreover, even if Applicant\u2019s debt delinquencies did arise due to circumstances\noutside of his control, he could have been reasonably expected to have exerted more\nresponsible efforts in addressing his debts once the conditions that contributed to the\ndelinquencies had passed or eased and his finances had improved. See ISCR Case\n03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2004). Not only are his listed debt delinquencies\nongoing, but he has failed to address them in any material way.  \nHolding a security clearance involves a fiduciary relationship between the\nGovernment and the clearance holder. Quite apart from any agreement the clearance\nholder may have signed with the Government, the nature of the clearance holder\u2019s\nduties and access to classified information necessarily imposes important duties of\ntrust and candor on the clearance holder that are considerably higher than those\ntypically imposed on government employees and contractors involved in other lines of\ngovernment business.  See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is\nrequired precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While\nthe principal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are explicit in\nfinancial cases.  Failure of an applicant to make more concerted efforts to pay or\nresolve his debts when able to do so raises security-significant concerns about the\nsufficiency of the applicant\u2019s demonstrated trust and judgment necessary to safeguard\nclassified information.\n\n8\nWhole-person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount the judgment\nquestions raised by his failure to address his delinquent debts in any tangible fashion\nto date.  While unemployment and low-paying work might have played a considerable\nrole in Applicant\u2019s accumulation of so many debts over an extended period (to include\nboth his pre-bankruptcy and post-bankruptcy employment circumstances), Applicant\nfailed to provide any explanatory material for consideration. Endorsements and\nperformance evaluations might have been helpful in making a whole-person\nassessment of his overall clearance eligibility, but were not provided. \nOverall, clearance eligibility assessment of Applicant based on the limited\namount of information available for consideration in this record does not enable him to\nestablish judgment and trust levels sufficient to overcome security concerns arising\nout of his accumulation of delinquent debts. Taking into account Applicant\u2019s lack of\nany documented explanations for his debt accruals and his failure to provide any proof\nof  corrective actions taken to address his old debts, it is still soon to make safe\npredictive judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to repay his debts and restore his\nfinances to stable levels commensurate with the minimum requirements for holding a\nsecurity clearance.\nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions\nPosing potential security concerns, too, are Applicant\u2019s omitted debts over 180\ndays delinquent and currently 90 days delinquent, respectively, in the e-QIP he\ncompleted in 2008. He denied any intent to falsify his answers but failed to credibly\ndemonstrate why he answered \u201cno\u201d to the pertinent question 28 without providing any\nexplanations in the comments section covered by section 30 of the questionnaire.  His\nlack of credible explanations why he failed to list or discuss his delinquent debts,\neither in direct response to question 28 or in the comments section of the\nquestionnaire precludes him from refuting the allegations in issue. \nWhile Applicant insists he promptly and voluntarily disclosed all of his debts\nwhen asked about them in a subsequent official OPM interview five months later, he\nacknowledged his delinquencies only after being shown a credit report by the\ninvestigating agent.  Under the circumstances, his explanations cannot be considered\nvoluntary. Applicant\u2019s answers are not sufficiently voluntary to enable him to invoke\nMC \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d Applicant\u2019s\ncorrections, while manifestly forthcoming and sincere, do not meet either the prompt\nor good-faith prongs of MC \u00b6 17(a), as these terms are generally understood.\nFrom a whole person perspective, Applicant appears to be an essentially\nhonest applicant with too little information from responsible individuals at work and in\nhis community who are familiar with his work and community efforts to formulate any\ncountervailing positive impressions about his reliability and trustworthiness.  \n\n9\nIn evaluating all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions,\nhis ensuing clarifying answers to an OPM investigator, and his appearance\nexplanations, his omission explanations and ensuing corrections are insufficient to\nenable him to convincingly refute or mitigate the deliberate falsification allegations.\nThe partial candor he displayed in explaining his debts to the OPM interviewer who\nfirst showed him his credit report  cannot be considered prompt good-faith corrections\nunder all of the circumstances accounted for.  \nQuestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations constitute core policy concerns of the personal conduct\nguideline (AG \u00b615). The basis for these concerns is clearly evident under the facts and\npolicy considerations developed under this guideline. Considering all of the evidence\nproduced in this record, unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by subparagraph 2.a of Guideline E.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the factors and conditions enumerated in 2(a) of the AGs.\nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following\nseparate formal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):  AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparas 1.a through 1.r:\n               Against Applicant\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubpara  2.a :\n      \n                Against Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security\nclearance.

Howry, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nMarch 15, 2010\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-\nQIP) on May 20, 2008 (Government Exhibit 1). On May 15, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 19, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non July 16, 2009. This case was assigned to me on July 17, 2009. DOHA issued notices\nof hearing on August 7, 2009, and September 2, 2009. I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on September 9, 2009. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1\n\n2\nthrough 6, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf,\nand submitted Applicant Exhibits A through H, also without objection. Applicant asked\nthat the record remain open for the receipt of additional documents. The Applicant\nsubmitted Applicant Exhibit I on September 18, 2009, and it was admitted without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on September 18, 2009. The\nrecord closed on September 18, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 56 and married. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks\nto obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is\nfinancially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Applicant admits the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d.,\nand 1.g. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact. He denies SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e.,\n1.f., and 1.h. \nThe Applicant testified that he was employed in the defense industry from 1983\nuntil 1999, when he was laid off. He then worked for a metropolitan area transit system\nfrom 1999 until a reduction in force in 2005. The salary for this job was substantially less\nthan his defense industry job. From June 2005 until April 2008 he was unemployed. In\nApril 2008, he resumed work in the defense industry. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section\n11; Transcript at 22-23, 32-37, 46-47, 94-99.)\n 1.a.\nApplicant admits that he filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7 of\nthe Bankruptcy Code in March 2001. He received a discharge in July 2001. According\nto the Applicant, the family debt situation occurred because of a period of\nunderemployment, exacerbated by a series of family related financial emergencies.\nEventually, a bankruptcy was the only way he saw to resolve the situation. (Applicant\nExhibits A, and I at 1-10; Transcript at 36-37, 40-41.)\n1.b.\nThis August 2001 county luxury tax lien in the amount of $83 was\nremoved in June 2004, as shown by the applicable release of lien. (Applicant Exhibit I at\n13-14; Transcript at 40-41.)\n1.c.\nThis August 2001 county luxury tax lien in the amount of $97 was\nremoved in June 2004, as shown by the applicable release of lien. (Applicant Exhibit I at\n11-12; Transcript at 40-41.)\n1.d.\nApplicant admitted that he owed $40,000 on a past-due mortgage when\nthe SOR was issued. This occurred because of the Applicant\u2019s unemployment between\n2005 and 2008, as well as a personal situation regarding the Applicant\u2019s wife, which\n\n3\nresulted in her losing her job as well. The Applicant attempted, over a period of several\nmonths, to work out a payment arrangement with his mortgage company. This was\nunsuccessful, primarily because the Applicant\u2019s mortgage was sold to another lender in\nthe midst of negotiations. Ultimately, the Applicant\u2019s house was foreclosed upon and\nsold at auction in May 2009 for $122,000.  At that time the Applicant had lived in the\nhouse for 23 years. Under his state\u2019s \u201cOne Action Law,\u201d the lender has no other\nrecourse and the Applicant has no further obligation on this debt. (Applicant Exhibits C,\nand I at 21-42, 57-65; Transcript at 41-45, 84-88.)\n1.e.\nApplicant has paid this collection account in full, as shown in a\ncommunication from the creditor. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I at 43-49; Transcript at 47-53, 82-\n85.)\n1.f.\nApplicant has consistently denied owing this dental bill, which is for\nunapproved work done to his step-son. The original creditor now refuses to deal with\nhim, and the collection agency is no longer in business. The Applicant has submitted\ndisputes to all three of the credit reporting agencies. I find that the Applicant has done\nall that he can to resolve this debt. (Applicant Exhibits E, and I at 50-56; Transcript at\n53-61.)\n1.g.\nApplicant admits that he owed a credit union $5,026 for an automobile\nlease. The records show that this debt was discharged as part of the Applicant\u2019s 2001\nChapter 7 filing, as discussed above. (Applicant Exhibit A at 6; Transcript at 61-67.)\n1.h.\nApplicant has consistently denied owing $80 for a past-due pest control\nbill. He submitted a copy of a paid check to the contractor from 2004. Applicant further\nstated that he has filed disputes with the credit reporting agencies concerning this debt.\nThe most recent credit report, from July 2009, does not show this debt. (Government\nExhibit 5; Applicant Exhibit G; Transcript at 69-72.)\nMitigation\nApplicant submitted a letter from his supervisor. This person, who has known the\nApplicant for about 15 years, states the Applicant:\n[I]s a man and employee that I would trust any level of our nation\u2019s\nsensitive information as I am 100% confident he would protect that\ninformation to the best of his ability. I would highly recommend that his\nsecurity clearance be granted. (Applicant Exhibit H.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\n\n4\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision. In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant, by his own admission, and supported by the documentary\nevidence, declared bankruptcy in 2001, had his home foreclosed upon in 2009, and had\nother past-due debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying\nconditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ In addition, AG\n\u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d\nApplicant=s financial difficulties arose because of a series of family emergencies,\nexacerbated by a bout of underemployment from 1999 to 2005, and unemployment\nfrom 2005 to 2008. He documented a serious and long-standing attempt to resolve the\nfinancial problem with his house. He showed that he has paid his legitimate debts, that\ntax liens were released several years ago, and that he has properly disputed debts,\nwhich he alleges are paid or are not his. At all times he has acted responsibly. These\ntwo mitigating conditions apply.\nApplicant has initiated a good-faith effort to pay off his creditors. As stated above,\nseveral have been paid. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation is stable. He is able to pay his current\nindebtedness in a timely manner. I find that \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c).\n\n6\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant had some\nfinancial problems, but his current financial condition is stable. Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(2), I\nhave considered the facts of the Applicant\u2019s foreclosure and his debt history. As stated\nat length above, much of this was brought about because of layoffs and family\nsituations. Based on the record, I find that there have been permanent behavioral\nchanges under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). Accordingly, I find that there is little to no potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)); and that there is no likelihood\nof recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nsituation.\nOn balance, I conclude that Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports granting his request for a security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.h.:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  Eligibility\nfor access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On January 22, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 3, 2009, and elected to\nhave his case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted\nthe Government\u2019s written case on March 2, 2009.  Applicant received a complete file of\n1\nrelevant material (FORM) on March 10, 2009, and was provided the opportunity to file\nMarch 25, 2009\n\n2\nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nApplicant submitted additional information. The case was assigned to me on March 19,\n2009. Based upon a review of the case file, eligibility for access to classified information\nis denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding \u00b6 1.p, alleging\nApplicant is indebted to a provider in the approximate amount of $2,194 on a medical\naccount that was placed for collection. As of July 12, 2008, this debt had not been paid.\nApplicant did not object to the amendment in his response to the FORM. He did not\ndeny the allegation. The Motion to Amend the SOR is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated February 13, 2009, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.g, and 1.h, of the SOR (Item 4). He denied the\nremaining allegations based in part on identity fraud. He provided additional information\nto support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school, and attended college from 1993 until 1997. Applicant served in the U.S.\nArmy from January 1986 until December 1989. He served in the National Guard from\nFebruary 1990 until December 1991 and again from March 1992 until October 1996. He\nheld a secret clearance while in the military (Item 4). He is divorced and has one son\n(Item 5). \nApplicant worked as an electronics technician for a defense contractor from\nFebruary 2005 until May 2008. He has continued the same senior level electronics work\nwith his current employer since May 2008. (Item 5). He reports that he worked in the\nelectronics field since 1997. From December 2002 until October 2003 and from\nSeptember 2001 until January 2002, Applicant was unemployed (Item 5).   \nThe SOR, as amended, alleges 16 delinquent debts, including a 2000 tax lien,\nand school loans, totaling approximately $86,000 (Items 6, 7 and 8). The accounts were\ncharged-off or in collection from approximately 2004. The delinquent debts are\nconfirmed by his credit reports (Items 7, 8).\nApplicant admitted that the accounts in allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.g, and 1.h are\ndelinquent accounts. He stated that 1.b and 1.c were paid but the creditor has not\nshown the account as paid. He did not provide documentation to support this statement.\nHe also admitted that the two delinquent student loans are his responsibility. They total\nalmost $61,000. In his answer, dated February 13, 2009, he denied the other accounts\n\n3\nbecause they were accounts opened without his consent. He explained that he notified\nthe credit bureaus (Item 4).\nIn his letter dated December 17, 2008, (included with his interrogatories) he\nstated that he has been in touch with his creditors to \u201ccatch up\u201d on payments. He\nexplained that he has not been able to arrive at an agreeable resolution. He also\nexplained that he could not provide any applicable documentation for the clearance\ninvestigation (Item 6). Applicant tried to apply for a loan to satisfy his commitments but\nwas denied due to his credit score (Item 6).\nApplicant\u2019s answer to the FORM does not include any documentation of payment\nfor any of the accounts he admits are his responsibility. He listed a garnishment for\ndelinquent student loans on his security clearance application and an entry on his\npersonal financial statement for payment of $100 a month toward the loans but he again\nsubmitted no documentation to support the claims.\nApplicant denied the other allegations in the SOR because \u201caccounts were\nfraudulently opened by a prior roommate\u201d. He also explained that his ex-wife was\nresponsible for the tax lien. \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the FORM reiterated his earlier statement that he\ncontacted the credit bureaus and told them of identity theft by a prior roommate some\ntime in 2003 or 2004. He explained that he is at the mercy of the three credit bureaus to\ninvestigate the allegations and correct the accounts in a timely manner. Applicant\nsuggests that an updated credit report would verify that \u201cmany of the accounts in\nquestion would show that they were fraudulently opened.\u201d Applicant attached two letters\nfrom creditors that verify that the accounts were fraudulently placed in his name. The\naccounts are allegations 1.j and 1.k. Applicant also included letters from TransUnion\nand Experian, dated March 2009 that reveal an Initial Security Alert has been placed on\nhis credit file for a period of 90 days. \nThe current status of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is as follows: the collection\ndebts and charged off accounts from late 2003 until the present are delinquent and not\npaid. Applicant did not report receiving financial counseling. He did not provide any\ndocumentation to support his position concerning the debts alleged.\nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is $2,218. He reported monthly expenses\nof $1,700 a month on his personal financial statement. This included a child support\npayment of $400. He listed the Department of Education loan ($111,000) as one debt in\nrepayment for $100 a month on the personal financial statement, dated November\n2008. He listed monthly payments to other creditors totaling $300. His net remainder is\nlisted as $218 (Item 6).\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on numerous accounts\ntotaling approximately $86,000. He admitted to several delinquent debts. His credit\nreports confirm his debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant still\nhas significant delinquent debts from 2004. He has not acted responsibly. His conduct\nover the last six months with his creditors does not remove security concerns or doubts\nabout his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He has approximately\n$84,000 in delinquent debt. This mitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant reported two periods of unemployment. He did not provide any explanation as\nto how this impacted his ability to pay his debts. He blames the majority of the\ndelinquent debt on fraudulent use by his roommate. He did not provide any information\nthat he acted responsibly in identifying and resolving these debts. He submitted a 2009\nletter that he sent to the credit reporting service concerning an Initial Security Alert but\nthis does not substantiate claims from 2004. I find this mitigating condition does not\napply. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\n\n6\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received counseling. He provided little or no\ninformation. His earlier promises in his answer to the SOR to pay in the future do not\nconstitute evidence of financial reform or resolution of debts. His efforts are not\nsufficient to carry his burden in this case. I conclude these mitigating conditions do not\napply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant disputed the majority of\nthe debts but did not provide documented proof to substantiate the claim of fraud except\nto the accounts alleged in 1.j and 1.k. This mitigating condition applies to those two\ndebts but does not apply to the remaining debts.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant reports that the majority of\nthe debts are due to fraud. However, he has not provided any documentation to support\nthe claim. The record contains scant information concerning Applicant. He chose to\nhave his case decided on the written record. His answer to the SOR and submissions to\nthe FORM are not sufficient for him to meet his burden in this case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations.\n \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On December 4, 2009, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant detailing security concerns for sexual behavior and criminal conduct under \nGuidelines D, and J. The security concerns arose out of two incidents, one in January \n2004, and the other in December 2006. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the Department of Defense on September 1, \n2006. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 8, 2009. \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 17, 2009. He admitted two of the \nthree factual allegations under Guideline D, but denied that the facts raised security \nconcerns. He admitted the one allegation under Guideline J, and again denied that the \nfactual allegation raised a security concern. He requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on January 4, \n \n1 \n \n \nApril 27, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2010, and I was assigned the case on January 14, 2010. DOHA issued a Notice of \nHearing on January 25, 2010, for a hearing on March 11, 2010. I convened the hearing \nas scheduled. Department Counsel offered seven exhibits, marked Gov. Ex. 1 through \n7, which were received without objection. Applicant and one witness testified on his \nbehalf. Applicant offered six exhibits, marked App. Ex. A through F, which were \nreceived without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March \n22, 2010. Based on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact. Applicant admitted two of the factual allegations \nunder Guideline D, and the one factual allegation under Guideline J. Applicant's \nadmissions were considered in my findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is 56 years old and has been employed as a production test supervisor \nfor a defense contractor for over eight years. Previously, Applicant owned and operated \nhis own business. He is a college graduate with a bachelor's degree in Industrial \nManagement, and a master's degree in operations management and finance. Applicant \nmarried in 1977 and divorced in 2005. He had two children from the marriage. He \nmarried again in March 2008. He sold the business in 1997. He moved in 1998 with his \nfirst wife to where she had been transferred by her employer. He was a stay-at-home \nfather from November 1998 until November 2003. During this time, he was involved in \nmany activities for his children and in the community. (Tr. 13-14, 33-34; Gov. Ex. 1, SF \n86, dated July 11, 2008; App. Ex. A, Resume, undated) \n \nApplicant was arrested for exposure of his sexual organs in January 2004. An \nundercover police officer's report states that the officer was on patrol in a local park. \nWhile near a picnic grove, the Applicant walked up to him, with his penis exposed, and \nstarted to masturbate. He asked the officer \"let's see what you got.\" The officer \nidentified himself and arrested Applicant. (Gov. Ex 4, Arrest report, dated January 13, \n2004) \n \nApplicant denies the activity as reported by the police officer. Applicant states \nthat he was jogging in the park and went to a public bathroom to relieve himself. When \nhe entered the bathroom, he noticed two men standing against the wall. He was \nuncomfortable, so he left the building. He went behind a palm grove to relieve himself. \nAs he was doing so, a person came up, identified himself as a police officer, and \narrested him for exposure of a sexual organ. Applicant was represented by an attorney \nand pled no contest to the charge. He was placed in a pre-trial intervention program, \npaid a $250 fine, and performed 50 hours of community service. After completion of the \ncommunity service, the charges were dismissed. (Tr. 37, 43-49, 57-58; Gov. Ex. 2, \nAnswers to Interrogatories, Testimonies, dated September 9, 2008 at 2) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nA neighborhood juvenile was passing by Applicant's house on the afternoon of \nDecember 24, 2006. The garage door and the door from the garage to the kitchen were \nopen. The juvenile observed the Applicant standing in his kitchen nude and facing him. \nApplicant was masturbating his erect penis. The juvenile went home and reported what \nhe had seen to his parents. His mother and another neighbor drove by Applicant's \nhouse and observed the garage door and the kitchen doors open and Applicant \nstanding nude in the kitchen. The juvenile's parents then notified the police. Applicant \nwas not at home when the police came to his house. They arrested him for lewd and \nlascivious acts in the presence of a minor, a felony, on December 27, 2006. Applicant \npled guilty to a third degree child abuse misdemeanor, and was sentenced to five years \nprobation, and to attend sex offender therapy group counseling. Applicant completed \nthe outpatient sex offender treatment program. His counselor noted that he was a very \nhard worker who addressed his personal issues and did everything asked of him in the \ntherapy. The counselor believes Applicant's nude life style led to the situation where he \nwas naked in the house. (Answer to SOR, Letter, dated November 9, 2009; Gov. Ex. 2, \nAnswers to Interrogatories, Testimonies, dated September 9, 2008, at 3; Gov. Ex. 5, \nPolice Incident Report, dated December 27, 2006; Gov. Ex. 6, Statute, Lewdness, \nIndecent Exposure; Gov. Ex. 7, Statute, Abuse of Children) \n \nApplicant testified that he was standing in his kitchen nude on the day in question \nbut was not masturbating. Applicant and his future wife had been at his house that night \nafter attending a party. She left in the morning, and he took a shower before getting \ndressed to go out. He had Christmas cards to finish and a Christmas present to wrap. \nHe went to the kitchen to accomplish the tasks. He admits he was in the kitchen nude \nwith the garage and kitchen doors open to air out the house. Someone could possibly \nsee him from the street. He believes his neighbors were watching and targeting his \nactions because he was a single male on a street of families with children. Applicant \npled guilty to the offense in November 2007 because he did not believe he would \nreceive a fair trial. Applicant is not required to register as a sex offender. His company is \naware of his arrest and conviction. Applicant's supervisor reminded him of the standards \nand conduct required of members of the company. He was told to report any further \nincidents to the company. Applicant's probation runs until November 2012. However, \nApplicant hopes he can get an early probation release as early as May 2010. (Tr. 49-56; \n59-64; Gov. Ex. 2, Answer to Interrogatories, Testimonies, dated September 9, 2008 at \n2; Gov. Ex. 3, Answer to Interrogatories, dated November 14, 2008; App. Ex. B, e-mail, \ndated February 24, 2008) \n \nApplicant's present wife testified that she has known Applicant for about three \nyears, and they have been married for two years. She considers him to be honest with \ngood integrity and work ethic. If she did not have trust in him she would not have \nmarried him. She did not believe that the December 2006 incident happened as it was \nperceived by the juvenile. She had been with Applicant and left the house about an hour \nbefore the incident. She does not believe Applicant would have deliberately exposed \nhimself to a child. (Tr. 20-30) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant's brother-in-law, a police officer, wrote that he considers Applicant to be \ntrustworthy, respectful of others, and dedicated to his job and family. He has observed \nApplicant in formal and social settings and Applicant was comfortable and maintained \nhis composure. (App. Ex. C, e-mail, dated February 14, 2010) Applicant's next-door \nneighbor, a bank vice-president and former naval officer, wrote that he has known \nApplicant for over three years. He considers Applicant to be of excellent character with \nan engaging personality. Applicant and his wife have a refined lifestyle and a record of \nactive involvement in community affairs. (App. Ex. D, Letter, dated March 1, 2010) \nAnother brother-in-law, a doctor, wrote that he has known Applicant for about five years. \nApplicant is amiable, intelligent, and forthright. He is exemplary, caring, sincere, and \nhonest in his relationships with his family and towards his work. He considers Applicant \nto be trustworthy and responsible. (App. Ex. E, Letter, dated March 2, 2010) One of \nApplicant's co-workers, the Director of National Programs for the company, wrote that \nhe has known Applicant for over ten years and lives on the same street as Applicant. \nApplicant is very professional and responsible at work. He has no concerns about \nApplicant's loyalty, or his ability to protect classified information. (App. Ex. F, E-mails, \ndated March 9, 2010)  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \n\n \n5 \n \n \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nThe security concerns raised for Applicant are from the same incidents. Security \nconcerns raised for sexual behavior and criminal conduct are the same, involving \nquestions of Applicant's reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness. Sexual behavior that \ninvolves a criminal offense indicates a personality or emotional disorder, reflecting lack \nof judgment or discretion which can raise questions about the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. (AG \u00b6 12) Criminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulation. (AG \u00b6 30) Since the security concerns are similar, the concerns will be \ndiscussed together. \n \n \nApplicant admits and the information clearly establishes that he committed the \ncriminal act of indecent exposure and the criminal act of sexual action before a child by \nexposing himself to a police officer and being nude while masturbating in his kitchen \nwith the outside doors open. The sexual criminal offenses for which Applicant pled guilty \nor no contest resulting in misdemeanor convictions raise Sexual Behavior Disqualifying \nCondition (SB DC) AG \u00b6 13(a) (sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the \nindividual has been prosecuted); and Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) \n\u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses). Applicant is still on probation \nuntil November 2012 for the offense that took place in December 2006. Applicant's \nprobation status raises CC DC \u00b6 31(d) (individual is currently on parole or probation). \n \n \nThe government produced substantial evidence by way of court documents, \ninvestigative reports, and Applicant's admission and statements to establish the \ndisqualifying condition in AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a) and 31(a). The burden shifts to Applicant to \nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns under \nsexual behavior and criminal conduct. An applicant has the burden to refute an \nestablished allegation or prove a mitigating condition, and the burden to prove or \ndisprove it never shifts to the Government. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe alleged security concerns have similar mitigating conditions. These \nmitigating conditions involve the passage of time, the unusual nature of the action \ncausing security concerns, the likelihood of recurrence, and whether the actions cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. I considered Criminal \nConduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the \ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment); and Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition (SB MC) AG \u00b6 14(b) (the \nsexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual \ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). The first incident took place in \nJanuary 2004, and Applicant was placed in a pre-trial intervention program that he \nsuccessfully completed by December 2004. The second incident took place in \nDecember 2006. Applicant was convicted in November 2007, and completed the pre-\ntrial intervention program only six months ago. Even though Applicant completed the \npre-trial intervention program and all required sexual offense counseling, three years is \nnot a long time to establish that he is successfully rehabilitated for his sexual and \ncriminal conduct. He is still under probation for the last offense. There were no unusual \ncircumstances raised to show why Applicant committed the offenses. He was not forced \ninto the action and his judgment was not impaired by any substance abuse or other \ncircumstances. While Applicant may be on the path to rehabilitation for his sexual \ndeviant and criminal conduct, he has not provided sufficient information to establish that \nhis sexual and criminal conduct would not happen again. Accordingly, he has not \nestablished these mitigating conditions for the security concerns alleged. \n \nSuccessful rehabilitation is also a factor to consider in mitigating the criminal \nconduct security concerns. There is no rehabilitative mitigating condition for deviant \nsexual behavior. I considered Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) AG \u00b6 \n32(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the \npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job \ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement). Applicant always acknowledged his behavior to police and his employer, \nbut he always denied that his actions were wrong. He has not been involved in any \nconduct that would raise additional security concerns since the incident in December \n2006. He successfully completed the pre-trial intervention program, and faithfully \nattended counseling. These are signs of successful rehabilitation. However under the \ncircumstances that the offense was committed only four years ago, he is still on \nprobation, and the pre-trial intervention was only completed about six months ago, it is \ntoo soon to determine that he has been successfully rehabilitated. Applicant has not \npresented sufficient information to mitigate security concerns for criminal conduct and \nsexual behavior.   \n \nWhole-Person Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that Applicant has been \nsuccessful in his career and is considered a reliable and trustworthy person in the \ncommunity and at work. His conduct in these two incidents shows a lack of judgment \nand discretion. Such a lack of judgment and discretion indicate that he may not be \nreliable, trustworthy, willing and able to exercise good judgment, comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations, and protect classified information. While there are signs of \nrehabilitation, it is too soon to determine that Applicant has been successfully \nrehabilitated, and that sexual behavior or criminal conduct problems will not arise in the \nfuture. Under these circumstances it is too soon to determine that he can be trusted with \naccess to classified information. Overall, on balance the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability at this time for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from his criminal conduct and sexual behavior.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On February 20, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guidelines F and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nOn March 26, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.\nDOHA received the request and the case was assigned to me on June 3, 2009.\nApplicant and Department Counsel agreed to a July 8, 2009, hearing date. On June 11,\n2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for that date. The hearing\nwas convened as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted four exhibits (GE) 1-4,\nJuly 23, 2009\n\n2\nwithout objection. Applicant introduced seven exhibits (AE) A-G, without objection. He\ntestified on his own behalf. The transcript (Tr.) was received on July 15, 2009. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated March 26, 2009, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c of the SOR. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d\nthrough \u00b6 1.h and \u00b6 2.a of the SOR with explanations and denied any intentional\nfalsification. \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1973, and attended college in 1987. His first marriage ended in divorce in\n1993. Applicant has three children from that marriage. He has worked for his current\nemployer since 2008 but he has worked for other defense contractors on a naval air\nstation for almost 20 years (Tr. 15). He held an interim clearance in 2002 (Tr. 29).\nWhen Applicant divorced in 1993, the court ordered his ex-wife to be responsible\nfor various marital debts. Applicant\u2019s wife was awarded the house and the family car.\nShe did not adhere to the order. Applicant did not know about the various marital debts\nassigned to his wife that were delinquent and were reported on his credit report.\nApplicant had a medical problem in 2007. He had a blockage in his heart and had\nto undergo a medical procedure in the hospital. He paid the medical bills and hospital\nbills that were presented to him at the time (Tr. 36). He believed that all the medical bills\nhad been paid.\nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts, including medical accounts. The current\nstatus of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is as follows: Applicant paid the $244 medical\ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a for $488. This medical bill is a result of an emergency\nprocedure. Applicant\u2019s insurance did not pay the total bill, but Applicant had no\nknowledge of that until recently (AE G).\nApplicant settled the $6,926 account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b for $2,543 in 2009. His\nex-wife used this account. He was not aware that it had not been paid as he did not\nreceive any notices. Applicant provided documentation of his payment (AE B).\nApplicant paid the account in SOR \u00b6 1.c in 2009. This was an electric bill for\n$168. He provided his bank statement as proof of payment (AE G).\nApplicant presented proof that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d for $5,356 is a\nduplicate of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. The account had been sold to a collection\nagency. Applicant researched the account that appeared on his credit report and the\naccount number is the same (GE 4).\n\n3\nApplicant paid the $490 medical account listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e. He presented\ndocumentation of three cancelled checks, each in the amount of $163.36. The first\ncheck was paid in 2008 (AE D).\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f is a duplicate of the debt referenced above in 1.b.\nThis debt has been paid (AE B).\nThe account listed in SOR \u00b6 1.g is satisfied. Applicant\u2019s wife paid this account\n(Tr. 61). This debt is not on Applicant\u2019s current credit report.\nThe medical account listed in SOR \u00b6 1.h is a duplicate bill. This account is paid\nas referenced in SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nApplicant earns approximately $60,000 a year. He received credit counseling in\n2008 (GE 2). He is current with his monthly expenses. He pays for his daughter\u2019s\ncollege expenses. He now pays a monthly fee to monitor his credit reports (Tr. 70).  He\nhas a budget. His net monthly remainder is approximately $500. He has a savings\naccount (GE 2). He has no credit cards (Tr. 79). \nApplicant completed his June 2007 security clearance application. In that\napplication he answered \u201cno\u201d to question 28a concerning financial delinquencies in the\nlast seven years of over 180 days (GE 1).\nIn 2009, in his answer to the SOR, Applicant explained that when he completed\nthe SF 86 in 2007 he did not know of any delinquent accounts. He incorrectly answered\nthe question to 28a but did not intentionally falsify his application.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n\n4\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on several accounts for a\n\n5\nperiod of time. His credit reports confirm the debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant did\nnot realize that he had the delinquent accounts. His ex-wife was ordered to pay various\naccounts. She did not do so. He paid his medical bills and thought that all were paid. He\ndid not realize that the insurance did not cover the full amounts. This mitigating\ncondition applies in this case. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ I find this a factor for\nconsideration in this case. As noted above, the divorce that occurred in 1993 impacted\nApplicant financially. He did not ignore any bills or live in an extravagant manner. He\nhas acted responsibly in paying his accounts.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has received financial counseling. He has resolved\nthe delinquent accounts. His efforts are sufficient to carry his burden in this case. I\nconclude these mitigating conditions apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant stated that he did not\nbelieve he owed some accounts. When he researched his credit report and learned that\nhis wife had not paid certain accounts, although he initially disputed or denied them, he\npaid them. I conclude this mitigating condition applies in part.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\n\n6\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nIn this case, when Applicant completed his 2007 security application, he did not\nanswer \u201cyes\u201d to question 28a. He stated in his answer to the SOR that he answered the\nquestions to the best of his ability and did not know about the indebtedness. He\nincorrectly answered the question but he did not intentionally falsify his application. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the Government has the\nburden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove\nan applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must\nconsider the record evidence as whole to determine whether there is direct or\ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time the omission\noccurred. ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in\nISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). Thus, AG \u00b6 16(a) does not\napply in this case. I find for Applicant on SOR \u00b6 2.a.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are sufficient to\novercome the Government\u2019s case. Applicant has worked for defense contractors for\napproximately 20 years. He is currently working. His 1993 divorce was the cause of the\ndelinquent accounts. He paid the delinquent accounts and provided documentation. He\n\n7\nanswered question 28a. concerning financial delinquencies in the last 7 years to the\nbest of his ability. He did not falsify his SF 86.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Jeffreys, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nJ, Criminal Conduct, Guideline H, Drug Involvement, and Guideline E, Personal \nConduct. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn December 7, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct, Guideline H, Drug Involvement, and Guideline E, \nPersonal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, \n2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 19, 2010, and elected to have \nhis case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on April 20, 2010. The FORM was \n \n1 \n \n \nAugust 10, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nmailed to Applicant and it was received on April 27, 2010. Applicant was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. \nApplicant did not object to the FORM and did not submit additional material. The case \nwas assigned to me on July 20, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 2.a, 2.b, 2.c, 2.d, 3.a, and 3.b. He \ndenied SOR \u00b6 1.d. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \nstatements submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 30 years old and has worked for a federal contractor since April \n2008. He is married and has a three-year old stepdaughter and an infant son. \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he used marijuana at least five times in 2005 and \npurchased it multiple times the same year.  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in February 2005 and charged with (1) No Proof Liability \nInsurance, (2) Driving Under the Influence (DUI)-Liquor, and (3) Operating a Vehicle \nUnder Combined Influence Alcohol/Controlled Substance. The police officer noted in his \nreport that he could smell alcohol on Applicant. Applicant denied to the police officer \nthat he had used alcohol. He was given a field sobriety test. Applicant explained he was \non prescription drugs. In his interview on June 19, 2008, with an Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) investigator he stated that on the day he was arrested he had \nstopped at a bar after work and consumed one to two beers before driving home. He \nconfirmed he was also taking prescription medications. In his answer to the SOR, he \nstated, \u201cI had nothing in my possession, no drugs, nor prescription medications, no \nalcohol.\u201d \nThe \nDUI \nand \nOperating \na \nVehicle \nUnder \nCombined \nInfluence \nAlcohol/Controlled Substance were dismissed. He paid a fine for No Proof of Liability \nInsurance.1 \n \n \nIn December 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with Public Intoxication. \nAfter drinking alcohol at a bar, Applicant got into an altercation with another person. He \npled guilty to Public Intoxication, and paid a fine and court costs. \n \n \nIn August 2007, Applicant was stopped by police for failing to wear his seat belt. \nThe police officer smelled marijuana. Applicant consented to a search of his vehicle. \nThe police officer noticed that Applicant had a pack of cigarettes in the door handle of \nthe driver\u2019s side of the vehicle. After conducting a pat-down search of Applicant, the \npolice officer found in Applicant\u2019s right shirt pocket rolling papers. In the vehicle, he also \nfound a small brown box with a smoking pipe with residue and a small amount of a \ngreen leafy substance. A loaded 357 Smith & Wesson pistol was found under the seat.2 \nIn Applicant\u2019s statement to the OPM investigator, he explained that he forgot about the \n \n1 Items 5, 7, 10. \n \n2 Item 8. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \npipe in the vehicle and believed he left it there some time in 2005. He was arrested for \n(1) Carrying a Pistol Without a Permit, (2) Possession of Drug Paraphernalia (3) Under \nthe Influence of any Substance which impairs the Mental or Physical Faculties, and (4) \nSeatbelt Violation. He pled guilty to Count (2). He was fined $500, court costs, and \nsentenced to 30 days in the city jail, which was suspended for 24 months. Applicant \npreviously had a permit to carry a concealed weapon, but that permit had recently \nexpired. He subsequently renewed the permit and Count (1) was dismissed, along with \nCount (4). It appears that Applicant was ordered to complete a Level I Substance Abuse \nProgram and upon completion Count (3) was dismissed.3 In his answer to the SOR, \nApplicant stated that he had no alcohol in his system when he was arrested. In his \nstatement to the OPM investigator, he said he was given a breathalyzer after his arrest \nand it recorded a .02 %. He stated that he had consumed a beer at lunch approximately \ntwo hours before the traffic stop.  \n \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on about May 13, 2008. In response to Question 23.c, which asked: In the last 7 \nyears have you had a firearms or explosive charge,\u201d Applicant answered \u201cno.\u201d This \nresponse was false because Applicant had been arrested for carrying a pistol without a \npermit in August 2007. When interviewed on June 19, 2008, by an OPM investigator, \nApplicant failed to disclose material facts about his 2007 arrest. He stated that he was \narrested for DUI and Possession of Drug Paraphernalia, but failed to disclose he was \ncharged with Carrying a Pistol Without a Permit. At the interview, he was asked if there \nwere any additional charges during that arrest or any additional details that were not \ncovered. He explained to the investigator that he was forthcoming with all the \ninformation and he could not recall any other details about the arrest. On September 11, \n2008, Applicant was interviewed again by an OPM investigator and was confronted with \nthe information about the arrest for Carrying a Pistol Without a Permit. In this interview, \nhe acknowledged that he purposely omitted this charge during the initial interview \nbecause in his opinion it was not a viable charge and he decided not to mention it. He \nalso added that he considered talking about this charge, but decided against it because \nit would make him look bad. He initially claimed ignorance over its existence because \nhe decided that there was no need to bring it up.4  \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant\u2019s explanation for failing to disclose the \nrequired information was that he believed the charge was suppose to be removed from \nhis record. He stated he was told by his lawyer it would not be on his record, and he \nbelieved he did not have to report it. Applicant\u2019s two explanations for not disclosing the \ncharges are inconsistent. Intentional failure to disclose the required information is a \nviolation of Title 18 of the United States Code \u00a7 1001, a felony. I find Applicant \nintentionally and deliberately failed to disclose on his e-QIP and to the government \ninvestigator that he had been arrested for Carrying a Pistol Without a Permit.  \n \n \n3 Item 8. \n \n4 Item 7.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR Applicant stated he has been drug free for four years \nand does not drink. He admitted that he made mistakes in his past. He is a member of \nthe Freemasons and works to help underprivileged citizens and handicapped children.  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the Adjudicative Guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the Adjudicative Guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n5 \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:  \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Drugs are \ndefined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include: (1) \nDrugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in \nthe Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or \ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) \ninhalants and other similar substances; Drug abuse is the illegal use of a \ndrug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction. \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 25 \nand especially considerer the following: \n \n(a) any drug abuse, and \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.  \n \nApplicant used marijuana at least five times in 2005. He purchased marijuana on \nmultiple occasions in 2005. He was arrested and convicted in 2007 for possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. I find the above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 \n26, and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or happened \nunder circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, and  \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs are used; (3) an appropriate period \nof abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nI was unable to question Applicant about his prior use of illegal drugs, what type \nof drugs he used, how often he used them, when was the last time he used them, and \nother pertinent questions, which would allow me to make an informed decision about \nthe security concerns regarding his drug involvement. I was not able to inquire about the \npolice officer\u2019s report that indicated when he was searched during his 2007 arrest rolling \npapers were found in his shirt pocket. I was unable to make a credibility determination \nor judge his demeanor and candor. Therefore, I find Applicant has not met his burden of \npersuasion. I find none of the above mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 sets out the security concern relating to criminal conduct:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person=s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under Criminal Conduct AG \u00b6 31 \nand especially considered the following: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \n \nApplicant was convicted of Possession of Drug Paraphernalia in 2007, and \nPublic Intoxication and No Proof of Insurance in 2005. He was also arrested for \nCarrying a Pistol Without a Permit, DUI, and Operating a Vehicle Under Combined \nInfluence Alcohol/Controlled Substance. Those charges were dismissed. Applicant did \nnot disclose the firearm arrest on his e-QIP or during his OPM interview. He was aware \nof the charge and intentionally withheld the information. His actions constitute a violation \nof federal law. I find the above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 23 and especially considered the following: \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and  \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \n\n \n7 \n \n \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last arrest was in 2007. The record does not contain evidence of any \nother involvement with law enforcement since then. However, Applicant deliberately \nfailed to disclose his firearm arrest because he did not want to \u201clook bad\u201d and he \ndecided there was no reason to bring it up. His omissions are a cause of concern. \nGovernment investigators rely on applicants\u2019 honest answers so they can conduct an \ninformative background check. Intentionally failing to provide the required information is \na violation of federal law and a security concern. Because he waived his right to a \nhearing, I did not have an opportunity to question Applicant about his conduct, \ndetermine his credibility, or access his candor. Applicant failed to meet his burden of \npersuasion.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct.  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered the following: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant intentionally failed to disclose his firearm arrest on his e-QIP and during \nhis interview with an OPM investigator. I find the above disqualifying condition applies. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions and especially considered the following under AG \u00b6 17: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \n\n \n8 \n \n \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully;  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, an such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \n \nApplicant decided that his arrest for a firearms offense was not a viable charge \nand he did not want to look bad by disclosing it. He failed to disclose it on his e-QIP, \nduring his initial OPM interview, and when he was interviewed a second time. There is \nsufficient evidence that Applicant\u2019s actions were intentional and deliberate. He did not \nmake a good-faith effort to correct the omission. I find AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. \nApplicant also stated that he did not think he was required to disclose it because his \nlawyer told him it would be removed from his record. This contradicts his original reason \nfor not disclosing it. In addition, no evidence was presented to show that Applicant\u2019s \nlawyer was specifically advising him concerning the security clearance process. Without \nfurther inquiry, I cannot find AG \u00b6 17(b) applies. I find the offense is not minor, and thus \nAG \u00b6 17 (c) does not apply. There is insufficient evidence to support the application of \nany of the remaining mitigating conditions.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 30 years old. He was last \narrested in 2007 and he was previously arrested twice in 2005. He used illegal drugs in \nthe past. I did not have the opportunity to question Applicant, determine his credibility, \nand appraise his candor. I was not provided any supporting evidence as to Applicant\u2019s \nuse of drugs after 2005 or his explanation for why he had drug paraphernalia in his \npossession in 2007. I was not able to question the purpose for carrying cigarette rolling \npapers in his pocket when he was arrested. In addition, Applicant made a conscious \nchoice not to disclose the arrest for a firearms violation. He decided it was not a viable \ncharge and did not want to \u201clook bad.\u201d His intentional omission is a violation of federal \nlaw and a felony. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion and mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under the guidelines for Criminal Conduct, Drug Involvement, \nand Personal Conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs   1.a-1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   2.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs  3.a-3.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant \nhas failed to rebut or mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns about his personal \nconduct. Applicant mitigated the information technology and foreign influence security \nconcerns. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \n1 \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nMarch 18, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on July 14, 2009, detailing security concerns about \nmisuse of information technology, and about personal conduct.  \n  \n \nOn July 30, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. On \nOctober 13, 2009, I was assigned the case. On October 8, 2009, an amended SOR was \nissued detailing additional security concerns under foreign influence, which was \nanswered on October 14, 2009. On November 6, 2009, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing scheduling the hearing which was held on November 20, 2009. The \ngovernment offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 5, which were admitted into evidence. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Ex. A through E, which were \nadmitted into evidence. On December 1, 2009, DOHA received the transcript (Tr.). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he admitted the SOR factual allegations, with \nexplanations. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. \nAfter a thorough review of the record, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old principal systems engineer who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since November 2007. He is seeking to maintain a security \nclearance. Applicant\u2019s minister states Applicant is honest, dependable, well-educated, \nand committed to his work. (Ex. A) Co-workers and acquaintances state Applicant is a \nskilled systems engineer, competent, who displays a high degree of personal integrity, \nresponsibility, ambition, and is a person of high morals. (Ex. B, C, D)  \n \nIn July 1985, Applicant married his first wife. Four or five months after their \nmarriage, his wife began to experience panic attacks. (Ex. 5, p. 81) The attacks became \nworse after they moved in 1996. She visited various psychiatrists, psychologists, and \ntherapists and was admitted two or three times for hospital stays to address her mental \ncondition. (Tr. 36) She was diagnosed as bipolar, but refused to take medication. (Tr. \n36) She was also diagnosed as having a narcissistic aggressive personality disorder. \n(Tr. 37)  \n \nIn 1998, Applicant was suspended for one month from work without pay for \nviewing adult-oriented material on the company\u2019s computer. Applicant experienced \nstress in his marriage and his life was in constant turmoil. He attempted to ease his \nstress by occasionally going to adult-oriented internet sites. (Ex. 2, p. 123) Applicant \nused this as an escape from pressure. (Tr. 58) Following his suspension, Applicant was \nrequired to view a sexual harassment video and sign an agreement acknowledging he \nwould be terminated for any future inappropriate use of the internet. (Ex. 5, p. 81)  \n \n \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n3 \n \nFrom August to December 1998, Applicant went to a licensed family therapist \nonce a month to deal with the stress in his marriage and family life. (Ex. 5, p. 81, Tr. 47) \nHowever, things got worse. Applicant would have to rush home because his wife had \nlocked herself in the bathroom saying she was having allergic reactions to the outdoors. \n(Tr. 37)  \n \nFrom 1998 to 2003 or 2004, Applicant asserts he did not view adult material on a \ncompany computer. (Ex. 40) In 2004 and 2005, Applicant\u2019s marital stress was coupled \nwith increased uncertainty at work. At work, departments were repeatedly restructured \nand jobs eliminated. (Ex. 2, p 123) He was moved to an isolated work area with two \nhalf-time employees. After being there a month, the start time of his project was \nextended by 300 days. (Tr. 39) To cope with the isolation, Applicant began to surf the \ninternet viewing adult-oriented or pornographic sites.  \n \nIn October 2005, he was placed on an unpaid disciplinary leave of absence while \nhe was investigated for viewing adult-oriented or material on a company computer. He \nwas told the investigation would take two to three weeks. (Tr. 51) One week later, \nApplicant voluntarily resigned before the company had finished the investigation and \nbefore any determination as to retention had been made. (Answer to SOR) Applicant\u2019s \nunderstanding was that if he voluntarily resigned the investigation would stop and no \ntermination determination would be made. (Tr. 31) Applicant was told the only response \nto future inquiries would be to list his job title, his start and end dates of employment, \nand he had voluntarily terminated his employment. (Tr. 31)  \n \nThe last time Applicant viewed adult-oriented material on a government or work \ncomputer was in 2005. From September 2004 through November 2004, Applicant \nreceived counseling from a licensed professional counselor. (Ex. 2, p. 128, Tr. 47) The \ncounselor referred Applicant to a psychologist specializing in men and sexual \ndysfunction. (Ex. 2, p. 130, Tr. 57) In 2005, his wife stopped attending counseling and \npressured him to stop going. He did not return to counseling until after separating from \nhis wife after she asked for a divorce. From October 2005 through August 2007, \nApplicant attended 44 counseling sessions, which focused on marriage issues and how \nto live with a woman who has multiple personality disorder. (Ex. 2, p. 130) In December \n2007, Applicant and his wife divorced after 22 years of marriage. (Ex. 1, p.153, Tr. 36)  \n \nHaving returned to counseling after separating, it took six months of therapy \nbefore Applicant could see what had been occurring in his life and marriage. (Tr. 39) His \ntreatment involved cognitive behavioral therapy. (Tr. 52) His counselor told him that the \npornography was his escape instead of turning to drugs or alcohol or seeking other \nwomen. (Tr. 38) It was Applicant\u2019s method of coping with his marriage. (Tr. 38)  \n \nFollowing his divorce, Applicant stated he no longer felt the need to escape to \npornography. (Ex. 3, p. 120V) Applicant\u2019s psychologist indicated Applicant\u2019s prognosis \nwas \u201cvery good,\u201d Applicant was emotionally stable, and the psychologist had no \nconcerns about Applicant having a clearance. (Ex. 2, p. 130) In 2008, Applicant was \n\n \n4 \n \nalso seen by a doctor at a family health center, who states Applicant has no condition \nthat would impair his judgment or reliability. (Ex. 2, p. 131)  \n \nIn December 2007, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing, e-QIP. Section 22 of that e-QIP asked Applicant if, during the \nprevious seven years, he had been fired from a job, quit a job after being told he would \nbe fired, left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct, or left a job \nby mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory job performance. Applicant \nlisted his August 2007, termination for non-performance. (Ex. 1, p. 160) Applicant did \nnot list his 2005 voluntary resignation. Applicant stated the concealment was caused or \nsignificantly contributed to by inadequate advice of authorized personnel, and upon \nbeing made aware of the requirement cooperated fully. (Tr. 34)  \n \nDuring a February 2008 personal subject interview, Applicant related his August \n2007 firing for lack of performance. (Ex. 3, p. 120Q) Applicant had asked his employer \nas to why he was being terminated after having received a raise and been told by his \nsupervisors that he was doing an outstanding job. Applicant believes he was the \u201cfall \nguy\u201d for the company vice president\u2019s poor performance. The vice president was fired \ntwo months later.  \n \nDuring the interview, Applicant remembers being asked if he had any problems \nwhile employed from 1984 to 2005. Since his work performance and appraisals had \nbeen excellent, he answered \u201cno\u201d to the question. (Tr. 59) He does not remember being \nspecifically asked about performance problems, disciplinary problems, security \nviolations, or computer misuse during the first interview. (Tr. 59) He failed to disclose his \n1998 suspension or his 2005 voluntary resignation. The report of investigation (ROI) \nindicated Applicant was employed from June 1984 until October 2005. The ROI states \n(Ex. 3, p.120T): \n \nHe had no disciplinary problems of any kind. He left [contractor] \nvoluntarily. One day in 10/2005, he turned his resignation letter into \nsupervisor [name]. He did not give 2 weeks notice. He voluntarily resigned \nbecause he felt the company had restructured to the point of his isolation. \nHe worked in many different departments due to the restructuring. Subject \nstated the politics at the company were ridiculous (No more specific \ndetails could be provided).The company was in survival mode and he did \nnot want to work there anymore.  \n \nIn May 2008, Applicant was again interviewed. Applicant told the investigator, he \nhad voluntarily resigned from his job in 2005 after being informed he was under \ninvestigation for misuse of computers to access the internet to view adult content \nmaterial. (Ex. 3, p. 120V) Applicant stated he answered the forms as he did because his \nemployer had told him if he resigned, all that would be indicated was that he had \nresigned and no other information would be given. (Ex. 3, p.120V) He asserted he was \nnot trying to mislead or falsify any information. (Ex. 3, p. 120V, Ex. 5, p. 82, Tr. 33)  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant stated he did not initially see the need to bring up what did not apply or \nto provide more information than what was asked by the questions on the questionnaire \nor by the investigator. He now sees he should have provided more information. (Ex. 3, \np. 120X) He realizes his actions were based on an incorrect assumption, which he \nrefers to as a \u201cgross misunderstanding on [his] part.\u201d (Tr. 33, 35) Since that time, he has \ncontinued to try to explain his thought process as to why he answered the questions as \nhe did. (Tr. 34) Once he realized he had reached an erroneous conclusion, he \nvolunteered all the information without being confronted. (Tr. 34, 85-86)  \n \nIn December 2008, Applicant married a citizen of Indonesia. He has a mother-in-\nlaw, sister-in-law, and two brothers-in-law who are citizens and residents of Indonesia. \nHe has never met his in-laws and maintains no relationship with them. (Ex. 3, p. 120N) \nThey do not speak English and he does not speak Indonesian. (Tr. 43) He has said \nhello to his mother-in-law one time on the telephone. (Tr. 43) One brother-in-law works \nat an electronic game store. (Tr. 64) He does not know what the others do. His mother-\nin-law is elderly. His wife was last in Indonesia in 2002. (Tr. 65) In February 2009, his \nwife applied to become a permanent resident alien. (Answer to SOR) In September \n2009, his wife became a permanent U.S. resident and must wait two years before she \ncan apply to be a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 42, 53) \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in 1971 in Indonesia. In 1984, her father died and, \nhaving no financial support, she lived with various relatives. In 1988, she moved to \nNebraska to live with relatives. In 1991, she completed high school, having been voted \nthe \u201cmost studious girl,\u201d and entered college. (Ex. E, Tr. 61) In 1993, her mother \nrequested she return to Indonesia to help her family financially, which she did. In 1994, \nshe obtained a job at the U.S. Embassy. In 2002, she moved to California to join her \nfirst husband. In 2005, she separated from her first husband and later divorced. In 2007, \nshe left California. Applicant and his wife met and married in December 2008. (Ex. E)  \n \nApplicant has two sons. One is 21, attending college, and is in Army ROTC. His \nother son is 18 and serves in the U.S. Air Force. (Tr. 44) His step-children are ages 8 \nand 12. Applicant\u2019s current marriage is very positive and supportive as opposed to the \nadversarial relationship of his first marriage. (Tr. 67) He asserts his life is totally different \nas are the influences on him. (Tr. 67)  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Indonesia. The request and the attached documents were not \nadmitted into evidence, but were included in the record as Hearing Exhibits (HEx.). The \nfacts administratively noticed are set out below.  \n \n \nIndonesia is a multiparty democracy, independent republic, and a developing \ncountry with a growing economy and some infrastructural shortcoming. (HEx. A, B) In \n2004, the first directly elected president was elected in free and fair elections. (HEx. B, \np. 1) The government generally respects the human rights of its citizens and upholds \n\n \n6 \n \ncivil liberties. (Id.) Nonetheless, there have been problems with killings by security \nforces, vigilantism, harsh prison conditions, corruption in the judicial system, limitations \non free speech, societal abuse and discrimination against religious groups, interference \nwith freedom of religion, violence against women and children, trafficking in persons, \nchild labor, and failure to enforce labor standards and worker rights. (Id.) \n \n \nSince 1999, basic freedoms have expanded. (Id.) The constitution states that all \npersons shall have the right to be free from torture, inhuman, and degrading treatment. \n(Id., p. 3) The law provides prisoners with the right to notify their families promptly and \nspecifies that warrants must be produced during an arrest. (Id., p.5) The law provides \nfor judicial independence (Id.) and presumes defendants are innocent until proven \nguilty. (Id., p.6) The constitution provides for freedom of speech and freedom of the \npress; however, the government at times, restricted these rights in practice. (Id., p.8) \nThe law provides for freedom of assembly and freedom of association, and the \ngovernment generally respects this right. (Id., p.10) \n \n \nThere is a widespread domestic and international perception that corruption is a \npart of daily life. (Id., p.14) The law prohibits domestic abuse and other forms of \nviolence against women. However, rape and domestic violence have been a problem. \n(Id., p.15) Sexual harassment is against the law and actionable under the criminal code. \n(Id., p.16) \n \n \nIndonesian police and security forces take active measures against both ongoing \nthreats posed by terrorists and violence elsewhere. (HEx. A, p. 2) Extremists may target \nboth official and private interests, including hotels, clubs, and shopping centers. \nExtremist groups have attacked nightspots and places of entertainment in the name of \nreligious or moral standards. (Id.) While Indonesia\u2019s counterterrorism efforts have been \nongoing and partly successful, violent elements have demonstrated a willingness and \nability to carry out deadly attacks with little or no warning. (Id.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n\n \n7 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nMisuse of Information Technology Systems  \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) AG \u00b6 39 explains the misuse of information \ntechnology systems security concern as follows: \n \n39. The Concern. Noncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or \nregulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise \nsecurity concerns about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, \ncalling into question the willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive \nsystems, networks, and information. Information Technology Systems \ninclude all related computer hardware, software, firmware, and data used \nfor the communication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, \nand protection of information.  \n \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The condition applicable to this case is: \n\n \n8 \n \n(e) unauthorized use of a government or other information technology \nsystem; \n \nIn 1998, Applicant received a one-month suspension for viewing adult-oriented \nmaterial on his company computer. He stopped his conduct until 2004 or 2005. To cope \nwith the isolation and marital problems, Applicant began to viewed adult-oriented sites \nat work. In October 2005, Applicant resigned before an investigation was completed.  \n \nThe mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 41 is potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual=s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n \nApplicant\u2019s surfing of adult content material on the computer at work was the \nresult of marital and work difficulties. His first marriage was adversarial. His wife \nexperienced panic attacks, was diagnosed as bipolar, and diagnosed as having a \nnarcissistic aggressive personality disorder. She refused to take medication. Marriage \ncounseling did not help and they divorced in 2007.  \n \nFollowing his divorce, Applicant no longer felt the need to escape to pornography \nor adult-oriented material. Applicant has received counseling from a psychologist \nspecializing in men and sexual dysfunction. Applicant\u2019s prognosis is very good. He is \nemotionally stable and has no condition that would impair his judgment or reliability.  \n \nIt has been four years since Applicant last viewed adult-oriented material at work. \nThe factors leading to it are gone. His treatment and a favorable prognosis indicate this \nconduct is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 41(a) applies.  \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \nThe Directive sets out various factors relevant to an applicant=s personal conduct \nthat may be potentially disqualifying. Paragraph 15 of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \nstates a concern where there is conduct:  \n \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The four conditions applicable to this case are: \n \n\n \n9 \n \n (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group; \n \nThere are two separate issues of personal conduct that are a concern: his surfing \nthe internet at work and his failure to list his voluntary resignation on his e-QIP or during \nhis first interview. Applicant engaged in inappropriate conduct and poor judgment at \nwork, which resulted in a one-month suspension and his voluntary resignation for \nviewing adult-orientated material on a company computer. His use of the computer to \nview such sites was a pattern of rule violations and a significant misuse of his \nemployer's time or resources. AG \u00b6 16d (3) and 16d (4) apply. These facts constitute \npersonal conduct a person might wish to conceal, as it adversely affects a person\u2019s \nprofessional and community standing. AG \u00b6 16e applies.  \n \nApplicant did not reveal the suspension or his resignation on his e-QIP or during \nhis first interview. Although he did list a more recent adverse September 2007 job firing \nfor non-performance, which had occurred two years after his resignation. Applicant \n\n \n10 \n \nknew his voluntary resignation occurred after misconduct and should have been listed \non the e-QIP and during his initial interview.  \n  \nApplicant asserted he was not trying to hide any information or mislead, but \nreceived inadequate advice on leaving his employment. At the initial interview, Applicant \nstated he voluntarily resigned because of company restructuring, his feeling of isolation, \nand company politics. Not only was the true reason for his voluntary resignation not \nrevealed, but false reasons were presented.  \n \nApplicant gave a false explanation in an attempt to minimize his culpability. If an \nindividual voluntarily offers an explanation or makes some statement tending to \nestablish his innocence, and such explanation or statement is later shown to be false, \nsuch conduct must be considered. Ordinarily, an applicant does not find it necessary to \ninvent or fabricate a voluntary explanation or statement tending to establish their \ninnocence.  \n \nAG\u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns, none of which \napply: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and, \n \n\n \n11 \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations.  \n \nAG 17(a) does not apply because there was no prompt, good-faith effort to \ncorrect the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts. It was only at the second interview that he revealed the actual reason for his \nfiring. At his termination, Applicant was told what would be revealed by his former \nemployer if the voluntarily resigned. He was never told not to report the incident. AG \n17(b) does not apply because the concealment was not caused or significantly \ncontributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal \ncounsel advising or instructing the individual specifically concerning the security \nclearance process.  \n \nAG 17(c) does not apply to the falsification because it is recent. It occurred on \nthe 2007 e-QIP and during a February 2008 interview. However, this mitigating \ncondition does apply to the net surfing in 1998 and 2005. Additionally, the viewing of \nadult content sites at work happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur. AG 17(d) applies for Applicant acknowledged the conduct, received \ncounseling, the stress of his prior marriage is gone, he is in a supportive marriage, and \nthe behavior is unlikely to recur. AG 17(d) does not apply to the falsification because \nApplicant has not acknowledged his conduct. \n \nAG 17(e) applies to the web surfing because Applicant has taken positive steps \nto reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, but not to the \nfalsification. AG 17(f) does not apply because the conduct was substantiated. AG 17(g) \ndoes not apply because association with persons involved in criminal activity was never \nalleged.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his adverse employment history demonstrates a \nlack of candor. The government has an interest in examining all relevant and material \nadverse information about an Applicant before making a security clearance \ndetermination. The government relies on applicants to truthfully disclose that adverse \ninformation in a timely fashion, not when it is perceived to be prudent or convenient. \nFurther, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse information about himself provides \nsome indication of his willingness to report inadvertent violations or other concerns in \nthe future, something the government relies on to perform damage assessments and \nlimit the compromise of classified information. Applicant\u2019s conduct suggests he is willing \nto put his personal needs ahead of legitimate government interests. The personal \nconduct security concerns are resolved against Applicant. \n \nForeign Influence \n \n \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the foreign influence security concern as follows: \n \n\n \n12 \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The two conditions applicable to this case are: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, and  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a permanent U.S. resident and must wait two years before she \ncan apply for her U.S. citizenship. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law, sister-in-law, and two \nbrothers-in-law are citizens and residents of Indonesia. He has never met his in-laws \nand maintains no relationship with them. They do not speak English and he does not \nspeak Indonesian.  \n \nThere is only a remote possibility that Applicant could be placed in a position of \nhaving to choose between the interest of a foreign individual, group, organization, or \ngovernment and the interests of the United States, especially because Indonesia has a \nsignificant lawless element, who may attempt to harm his in-laws to gain some kind of \nadvantage over Applicant. AG \u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(d) apply.  \n \nThree of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable:  \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                          \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nBased on his relationship and depth of loyalty to the United States, Applicant can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of U.S. interests. AG \u00b6 18(b) \napplies. Applicant\u2019s communication with his in-laws is non existent. His wife \ncommunicates with her mother and siblings in Indonesia.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse is a registered U.S. alien waiting to obtain her U.S. \ncitizenship. She completed high school and started college in the U.S. She has lived \ncontinuously in the U.S. since 2002. Applicant\u2019s current marriage is very positive and \nsupportive. With his wife living with him in the U.S., there is nothing in the relationship \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \n \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Indonesia must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation in that country, as well as the dangers existing in Indonesia.2 A \n\u201ccurrent \nand \naccurate \nassessment \nof \nthe \n\u2018geopolitical \nsituation\u2019 \nand \nthe \nsecurity/intelligence profile of the [foreign] country vis-\u00e0-vis the United States is crucial \nin Guideline B cases.\u201d3 The available information shows that Indonesia is an open \nsociety, governed through a democratically-elected legislature and executive, checked \nby an independent judiciary. While there are notable problems regarding human rights \nabuses by the Indonesian government, all of the available information shows Applicant=s \nin-laws are not likely to be subject to coercive methods to obtain information from \nApplicant.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his in-laws generates a security risk only if the \ncontact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, pressure or \ncoercion (AG \u00b6 7(a)). Security clearance decisions must be based on current DoD policy \nand standards (See ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003). There is \nno heightened risk present. \n \n \n2 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion). \n  \n3 See ISCR Case No. 07-05686 (App. Bd. November 12, 2005 at 4, footnote 3. \n\n \n14 \n \n \nThe risk of terrorism in Indonesia is a factor to consider in assessing the security \nrisk. Over the past years, Indonesia has been victimized by brazen and spectacular \nepisodes of terrorism. Terrorism, however, is indiscriminate by nature. The possibility \nthat it may be employed against specific individuals, such as the family member of a \nsecurity clearance holder, is higher in countries that openly espouse it, are hostile to the \nU.S., or are controlled partially by terrorist organizations. None of these characteristics \napply to Indonesia.  \n \nIndonesia is a democracy. It is not a hostile, totalitarian state seeking to project \nits power worldwide through the brute intimidation or coercion of its citizens domestically \nand abroad. I conclude that there is little likelihood Indonesia, a nation friendly toward \nthe United States, will try to leverage Applicant=s relationship with his in-laws to gain \naccess to the information with which Applicant works. Based on the foregoing, I \nconclude SOR & 3.a through 3.d for the Applicant, and further conclude available \ninformation is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline B. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The web surfing occurred more than \nfour years ago and was the result of marital problems that no longer exist. Applicant\u2019s \ncontact with his in-laws in Indonesia is non existent. His wife is not a security concern \nbecause she is living with him in the U.S. However the falsification leaves me with \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \narising from his personal conduct. \n \n\n \n15 \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award \nof a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a lifetime \noccurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to \nthe evidence presented. Under the Applicant=s current circumstances more time needs \nto pass from his most recent falsification. A clearance is not recommended.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Information Technology: \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u20131.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b and 2.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Foreign Influence:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a \u2013 3.d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on July 9, 2008. On May 28, \n2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, \nciting security concerns under Guideline H. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on June 4, 2009; answered it on June 22, 2009; and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on \nJune 24, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 17, 2009, and the \nSeptember 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \ncase was assigned to me on July 22, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July \n24, 2009, scheduling the hearing for August 27, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through G, which \nwere admitted without objection. The record closed upon adjournment of the hearing. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 3, 2009. \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nOn my own motion, and without objection from either side, I amended the SOR to \ncorrectly reflect Applicant\u2019s full name (Tr. 4-5). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 23-year-old analyst employed by a federal contractor. He \ngraduated from college in May 2008 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in information systems, \nand he began working for his current employer shortly after graduation. He has never \nheld a security clearance. \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his security clearance application, he disclosed that \nhe used marijuana 80-100 times from September 2004 to February 2008, used cocaine \nonce on New Year\u2019s Day, 2008, sold marijuana to friends from August 2007 to February \n2008, and obtained and sold cocaine to two people. He explained that he stopped his \ndrug involvement because he realized he needed to \u201cgrow up\u201d and prepare for his \u201creal \nlife.\u201d He attributed his single use of cocaine to bad judgment (GX 1 at 31-32).  \n \n \nDuring an interview with a security investigator in September 2008, Applicant \nstated that he began using marijuana in high school, and smoked it regularly two or \nthree times a week. He told the investigator he used marijuana mostly because of peer \npressure, but he also relied on it as a stress reliever, and to relieve the pain of his \nCrohn\u2019s disease. He decided to stop using marijuana after he experienced a bad flare-\nup of his Crohn\u2019s disease in January 2008 and was hospitalized (GX 2 at 8-9). He has \nnever sought or received treatment for drug abuse and does not believe he needs it (Tr. \n33). He no longer associates with any of the persons with whom he used drugs, \npurchased drugs, or provided drugs (Answer to SOR). His present circle of friends and \nhis father know about his prior drug involvement (Tr. 39).  \n \n \nApplicant worked at various part-time and summer jobs while in college, including \na local restaurant. Applicant purchased marijuana from one of the cooks at the \nrestaurant (Tr. 35), and he sold it to friends, usually making about a $5.00 profit on each \ntransaction (Tr. 36).  \n \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. He \nsubmitted matters in mitigation, including a notarized statement that he \u201cwill never again \nuse or distribute any illegal substance and [he] understand[s] that doing so will result in \nan automatic revocation of [his] security clearance, among other consequences.\u201d \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant submitted his college transcript, reflecting a grade point \naverage of 2.970 on a four-point scale (AX A). He also submitted statements from five \nfriends and former classmates (AX B-G). They describe him as honest, trustworthy, \ndependable, generous, compassionate, and loyal. They comment on his increased \nmaturity, hard work, and enthusiasm for his new job. None of the friends who submitted \nletters were involved in his drug abuse (Tr. 34). His younger brother describes him as a \nreliable and trustworthy person who has matured significantly since his graduation from \ncollege (AX H). His performance appraisal for the period ending in June 2009 rates him \nas frequently exceeding expectations and comments favorably on his ability to take on \nindependent responsibility (AX B). \n \n \nApplicant has recently begun graduate school, while working full-time. He intends \nto obtain a master\u2019s degree in information security. He is active in his church and \nparticipates in several musical and sports groups.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \n\n \n4 \n \n \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant purchased and used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from September 2004 until February 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), used cocaine once \non New Year\u2019s Eve (December 31, 2007-January 1, 2008) (SOR \u00b6 1.b), purchased and \nsold marijuana to friends from August 2007 to February 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and \npurchased and sold cocaine to two people between August 2007 and February 2008 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d). The concern under this guideline is as follows: AUse of an illegal drug or \nmisuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions \nabout a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.@ AG \u00b6 \n24.  \n \nGuideline H encompasses Adrugs, materials, and other chemical compounds \nidentified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., \nmarijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens).\u201d AG \u00b6 \n24(a)(1). Drug abuse is Athe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that \ndeviates from approved medical direction.@ AG \u00b6 24(b). Disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline include Aany drug abuse@; and Aillegal drug possession, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.@ AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c). Applicant\u2019s drug involvement raises AG \u00b6 \n25(a) and (c), shifting the burden to him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(a). The first prong of AG \u00b6 26(a) \n(Ahappened so long ago@) focuses on whether the drug involvement was recent.  There \nare no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination \nmust be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. If the evidence \nshows Aa significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \nAchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.@ ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement stopped in February 2008, about 18 months before \nthe hearing. He had been regularly involved in marijuana for more than three years and \nhad been selling drugs for about six months. He stopped his drug involvement \nvoluntarily because he wanted to change his life. He graduated from college and began \nworking for his current employer in May 2008. He has a new circle of friends. He is \ndeeply involved in his job, attends graduate school part-time, and is involved in his \ncommunity. He appears to have left his college lifestyle behind him. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n26(a) is established.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse \nany drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and \ncontacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an \nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b). Applicant no longer associates \nwith drug users, has moved from the college environment to the adult workforce, has \nabstained from drugs for 18 months, and submitted a statement of intent that effectively \nplaces him on self-imposed probation. I conclude AG \u00b6 16(b) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by Asatisfactory completion of a \nprescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and \naftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified medical professional.@ AG \u00b6 26(d). This mitigating condition is not \nestablished, because Applicant has not sought or received any drug treatment. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is young, working on his first real job after graduation. He apparently \nevaluated his lifestyle while hospitalized in February 2008, looked toward the future, and \ndecided it was time to \u201cgrow up.\u201d He was very candid, sincere, and credible at the \nhearing. He has been open and honest about his previous drug involvement, thereby \nminimizing his vulnerability to coercion by threats of disclosure. By submitting his \nstatement of intent, he has voluntarily put himself on probation, knowing that any return \nto drug involvement will terminate his budding career.  After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline H, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \nbased on his drug involvement. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On\nDecember 31, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge\neither did not consider or did not correctly weigh Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence.  Applicant argues\nthat this evidence was sufficient to warrant a favorable decision.  Applicant has not demonstrated\nthat the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 08-05344 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 3, 2010) and ISCR Case No. 08-11782 at 2 (App.\nBd. Feb. 17, 2010).  In this case, the evidence Applicant relies on was explicitly cited by the Judge\non pages 2, 3, and 4 of the decision.  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge\nconsidered all the evidence.  Furthermore, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone\ncompel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has\nto weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,\n2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for\na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant was arrested three times between 2004 and\nDecember 2007 for infractions  related to drunk driving and a consequent automobile  accident.  She\nalso found that Applicant intentionally and deliberately withheld information from his security\nclearance application.  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  The Judge reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was\ninsufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de\nnovo.  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn July 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nG, J, and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 25, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 22, \n2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on the same day, and I convened the hearing \nas scheduled on November 10, 2009.

Applicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant testified \nand offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B and they were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 18, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 29 years old and has been employed with a federal contractor since \nOctober 2008. He has previous employment with a different federal contractor. He is not \nmarried and has no children. He earned bachelors and associates degrees. His present \njob is as an information systems specialist.1  \n \n \nIn February 2004, Applicant was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DUI). He \nwas with high school friends and all of them consumed alcohol. He was drinking \nSouthern Comfort. He dropped his friends off at their homes and proceeded to go to his \nhome when he was stopped by police. He stated he had consumed about three to four \nalcoholic drinks over a three-hour period. A breathalyzer was administered and \nApplicant\u2019s results were .12%. Applicant admitted that he knew he was driving under the \ninfluence of alcohol and should not be driving, but did not believe he was drunk. He was \nconvicted of DUI and sentenced to 30 days in jail, which was suspended. In addition, his \ndriver\u2019s license was restricted for one year and he was ordered to attend the state\u2019s \nalcohol and safety awareness program (ASAP). He completed the program and stated \nhe learned about the effects of alcohol on the body.2  \n \n \nApplicant stated that he considers himself a social drinker. He believed he could \nhandle driving after he had been drinking and did not believe he was over the legal limit \nwhen he drove. He admitted he felt the effects of the alcohol he had consumed, but felt \nhe had control over his motor functions. Once he was stopped by police, he knew he \nwas over the limit.3  \n \n \nIn July 2007, Applicant was visiting friends in another city. He consumed one \ndrink at the hotel. He and his friends then went to a lounge and he consumed \u201ca couple \nof drinks.\u201d His friend felt light-headed so he took her back to the hotel in a horse drawn \ncarriage. When they arrived, he realized he left his automatic teller bank card (ATM) at \nthe lounge and did not have money to pay the carriage driver. He did not think the driver \nwould take him back to the lounge without first receiving payment, so he drove his \nfriend\u2019s car back to the lounge. He was stopped by the police because he was driving \non a street that was designated for a monorail. He received five tickets. Applicant stated \nhe did not feel drunk and he did not notice the effects of alcohol. He stated he panicked \n \n1 Tr. 80-82. \n \n2 Tr. 22-28. \n \n3 Id. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nwhen he realized he did not have his ATM card. He disputes that a roadside sobriety \ntest was administered. He was taken to the police station where he was given a \nbreathalyzer. It was determined he was over the legal limit, but he does not know what \nthe reading was. He was arrested and charged with DUI. He remained in the city for five \ndays to resolve the charges. He pled guilty and his license was suspended for one year \nin the state and he received a fine. He stated he contacted his manager at work and told \nhim he needed to take time off from work. He told him about his arrest. He stated his \nmanager told him to keep it quiet and not report it to the company.4  \n \n \n \nA couple of days before his birthday in December 2007, Applicant went to a bar \nby himself. He consumed two to three drinks and then the bartender made him a special \ndrink for his birthday. He stated he felt he had his alcohol consumption under control. \nHe left the bar to get something to eat and fell asleep while driving and hit a parked car. \nHis airbag deployed. He stated he was going the speed limit. He did not have his cell \nphone with him, so he moved his car out of the street and walked home. Shortly \nthereafter, the police arrived at his house and asked him about the accident. He \nadmitted he hit the car. He was taken to the police station and given a breathalyzer \nwhich recorded .16%. Applicant did not consider himself drunk when he left the bar. \nApplicant was found guilty of DUI, second offense and hit-and-run not reported. He was \nsentenced to one year in jail and nine months were suspended. He served 60 days and \nthe remaining 30 days was suspended for good conduct. He took leave without pay \nduring his sentence. Applicant\u2019s license was suspended for three years. The \nsuspension expires in April 2011. He was ordered to attend ASAP. He stated he learned \na great deal from ASAP. He learned the scientific information about how alcohol affects \nthe body. He was ordered to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) for 20 sessions. He \nstated he admitted at the meetings he was an alcoholic, but does not believe he is one. \nHe never engaged in a 12-step program. He stated he does not believe he is alcohol-\ndependent. He believes he can control his alcohol consumption. He completed two \nASAP courses, one for ten weeks and one for six weeks. Applicant believes he is on \nunsupervised probation until 2011. Applicant has only attended court-mandated \ncounseling. When Applicant returned to work, his employer could not permit him to work \nin the same position and could not find a position for him within the company due to the \nadverse conduct, so Applicant resigned. He was unemployed for a period of about four \nmonths before he found another job.5  \n \n \nApplicant stated he has \u201ccut back significantly\u201d6 on his drinking and he believes \nhe can control his alcohol consumption. He stated that everything bad that has \nhappened to him involved alcohol consumption. He stated his last drinks were at a \nwedding in August 2009, where he consumed three drinks of whiskey at an open bar. \n \n4 Tr. 29-38, 54. \n \n5 Tr. 19, 38-48, 55-60, 70-72. \n \n6 Tr. 20. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nHe stated he rarely goes to bars, but will have a drink at a restaurant. He may drink \nthree times a month and have about one to three drinks, if it is a special occasion.7  \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) on March 30, 2008. \nIn response to question 23d, which asked if he had committed any alcohol-related \noffenses, Applicant responded \u201cYes,\u201d and divulged the 2004 offense and the July 2007 \noffense. He did not divulge the pending charges for the December 2007 DUI and hit-\nand-run offenses. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 23c which asked if he had any charges \ncurrently pending. Applicant was aware at the time he had an upcoming court date on \nApril 30, 2008, to resolve his December 2007 charges. He stated he did not know why \nhe did not divulge his most recent offenses that were pending. He stated he did divulge \nit to the investigator when he spoke to him on April 28, 2008, days before he was to \nappear in court. I find Applicant intentionally and deliberately withheld requested \ninformation from his SCA that he was required to divulge.8 \n \n \nApplicant stated that his parents were concerned about his alcohol consumption \nand wished he would not drink. They do not approve of his consumption because of the \nproblems it has caused him.9  \n \n \nApplicant is very involved with his church and is a mentor to young adults. He \nhas used his experiences to help his siblings not make the same mistakes he has \nmade.10  \n \nApplicant provided certificates of completion for educational programs he \ncompleted. He also provided two character letters. One letter from his pastor, who \nbelieves Applicant is an intelligent, capable, dedicated, and trustworthy young man who \nhas learned from his mistakes. A second letter is from a friend who describes him as a \nhard worker and amazing human being whose opinion is valued.11  \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n7 Tr. 48-52. \n \n8 Tr. 63-69, 84-86. \n \n9 Tr. 69-71. \n \n10 Tr. 20-21. \n \n11 Tr. 20-21; AE A and B. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption:  \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22 including:  \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.  \n \nApplicant has three alcohol-related arrests and convictions. One occurred in \n2004 and two occurred in 2007. The above disqualifying condition applies.  \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 and \nespecially considered the following: \n \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt o the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); and \n \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \n \nApplicant has three DUI convictions. His last alcohol-related arrest involved a \nsingle vehicle hit-and-run accident. Each time he drove his vehicle after consuming \nalcohol, he believed he was not intoxicated. His breathalyzer readings were \nconsiderably higher than the legal limit, especially his most recent DUI reading. He \nattended ASAP after his first arrest, but apparently it had little impact on his decision-\nmaking process, and he did not heed its warnings. Applicant completed the required \ncourt-mandated alcohol safety programs and attended AA as ordered. Although he \nacknowledges that everything bad that has happened in his life has involved alcohol, he \ncontinues to believe that he can be a responsible drinker. That may be the case, but his \ntrack record reflects the opposite. Applicant makes poor decisions when he consumes \nalcohol, and he continues to consume alcohol. No evidence was presented to confirm \nany treatment program, voluntary attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous, or a similar \norganization, or any prognosis from a medical professional. Although it has been \napproximately two years since Applicant\u2019s last alcohol-related arrest, I am not convinced \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthat he grasps the true impact alcohol has on his life. He appears to believe that he was \nmerely unlucky and can control his behavior. There is no evidence that Applicant is \nalcohol-dependent; however, there is overwhelming evidence that Applicant\u2019s judgment \nis impaired when consuming alcohol. After his first alcohol-related incident, he was on \nnotice that he could not gauge his level of intoxication. He did not learn and proceeded \nto have two more incidents. Applicant is an educated man who is making bad choices. \nBased on his past, I am not convinced at this juncture, that Applicant has fully embraced \nthe corrective measures necessary to avoid future alcohol-related problems, and that \nfuture problems are unlikely to recur. I find none of the above mitigating conditions \napply. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 sets out the security concern relating to criminal conduct:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person=s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under Criminal Conduct AG \u00b6 31 \nand especially considered: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person \nwas formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; and \n \n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation. \n \n \nFrom 2004 to 2007, Applicant had three DUI convictions and a conviction for a \nsingle vehicle hit-and-run. He has completed his jail sentences and his driver\u2019s license \nremains suspended. Applicant is on probation until 2011. I find all of the above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 23 and especially considered the following: \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant has three DUI convictions for incidents that occurred in 2004 and 2007. \nHis latest incident involved a single vehicle accident when he fell asleep at the wheel \nwhile driving home from a bar. He remains on probation until 2011. I find (a) does not \napply because Applicant is still on probation and no evidence was offered to show his \nconduct is unlikely to recur. His repeated criminal conduct casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment. \n \n \nApplicant failed to provide sufficient substantive evidence that he has changed \nhis alcohol consumption and is successfully rehabilitated. He continues to consume \nalcohol and believes he can be responsible. Applicant is remorseful for his actions \nbecause of the negative impact it has had on his life. He testified that he has modified \nhis consumption of alcohol. Based on the character letters and certificates of completion \nhe provided, it appears he has constructive community involvement. However, due to \nApplicant\u2019s repeated conduct, not enough time has passed to convince me that he is \nrehabilitated and there is insufficient evidence to conclude such. I find AG \u00b6 23(a) and \n23(d) do not apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG & 15:   \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 16 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and  \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \n \nWhen completing his SCA Applicant failed to divulge he had pending DUI and \nhit-and-run charges. He was arrested in December 2007 and his court date was April \n30, 2008. He knew when he completed his SCA on March 31, 2008, that he had \npending charges. He did not provide any credible explanation for why he failed to \ndivulge this information. I find that the both of the above disqualifying conditions apply. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I \nhave considered all of them under AG \u00b6 17 and especially considered the following: \n \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \n \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant made a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the \nomission. He did not divulge the pertinent information until he was interviewed by an \ninvestigator, two days before his court date. I find mitigating condition (a) does not \napply. Applicant had two prior DUIs and failed to disclose his third DUI and hit-and-run \ncharges that were pending. His concealment of this information is not considered minor \nand it casts doubts on his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. I do not find there \nwere any unique circumstances. I find mitigating condition (c) does not apply. There is \nno evidence to support the application of mitigating condition (d) in connection with his \nfalse answers on his SCA. Applicant did not provide a credible explanation for his \nconcealment of important information he failed to provide on his SCA. Applicant\u2019s \nfamily, friends and employer are aware of his criminal and alcohol history, which \nreduces his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. However, there is no \nevidence that they are aware of his falsification on his SCA, so mitigating condition (e) \nonly partially applies.  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n10 \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is an educated man. He \nprovided evidence that he is involved in his community. He has three DUI convictions \nand a hit-and-run conviction, the last incident occurring in December 2007. Each time \nApplicant drove his car after drinking alcohol, he did not believe he was intoxicated. His \nbreathalyzer results showed he was well over the legal limit. He continues to consume \nalcohol and believes he can do so responsibly. Applicant intentionally and deliberately \nfailed to divulge his most recent DUI and hit-and-run charge that was pending at the \ntime he completed his SCA. He remains on probation until 2011. Based on his repeated \nconduct, I am not convinced that he has made permanent behavioral changes and it is \ntoo early to conclude otherwise. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder the Guidelines for Alcohol Consumption, Criminal Conduct, and Personal \nConduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph  2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph  3.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 7, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On February 3, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \n \n1  FORM Item 3. \n \nJuly 31, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security \nconcerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline G (Alcohol \nConsumption). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked. \n \nOn February 10, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected \nto have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 2). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated March 25, 2009, was provided to him \nby letter dated March 26, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on March 31, 2009. He \nwas afforded a period of 30 days to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. He failed to submit any materials, comments, or objections in \nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on June 12, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all the SOR factual allegations with explanations. His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 26-year-old hydraulics engineer working for a defense contractor.3 \nHe graduated from high school and attended college from August 2001 to May 2005. \nHe received a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering. As of the \nsubmission of his e-QIP (January 2008), Applicant was pursuing a Master of Science \ndegree in mechanical engineering on a part-time basis.  \n \nApplicant has never been married and has no children. His security clearance \napplication shows he was employed as a \u201csecurity assistant\u201d from January 2004 to May \n2004. From September 2004 to May 2007 he worked as a research and teaching \nassistant. He has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, from June \n2007, to the present. There is no evidence that he has ever been fired from a job or that \nhe had to leave a job under unfavorable circumstances.  \n \nIn his 2008 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that he had been \ninvolved in three alcohol-related incidents. In April 2007, he was convicted of public \ndrunkenness. He was attending a fraternity house party and consumed an unrecalled \namount of alcohol. He set off some fireworks and the police were called. He ran away \nfrom the police officers and was arrested, charged with, and convicted of public \ndrunkenness. In September 2005, he was convicted of public disturbance. He invited \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n3  Item 3 (2008 e-QIP) is the source for the facts in this decision, unless stated otherwise. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmembers of his Frisbee team to a party in his apartment. The neighbors called the \npolice because of the noise level. Applicant had consumed three to four shots of hard \nliquor. He claimed he was not intoxicated and that alcohol was not a factor in this \nincident. \n \nIn April 2004, Applicant was admitted overnight into a hospital because of his \nover-consumption of alcohol. Applicant was at a fraternity party and consumed \napproximately 25 shots of hard liquor. He passed out in a bathroom and his friends \ncould not wake him up. Emergency medical personnel and police officers were called to \nassist. Applicant was hospitalized overnight. He was charged with and convicted of \nunderage alcohol consumption. As a result of this incident, he was evaluated by a \ncollege advisor and placed on probation. He has not participated in any alcohol-related \ncounseling or treatment. \n \nApplicant\u2019s first use of alcohol was at age 17. He characterized his alcohol \nconsumption during college as significant, and described himself as a heavy drinker. He \ntypically drank alcohol twice a week until his senior year in college. Around September \n2004, he drank alcohol three times a week. He knew that his excessive use of alcohol \nwas not good for him, and he admitted the possibility that he had an alcohol problem \nduring that period. Applicant drove his car while under the influence of alcohol two or \nthree times. \n \nIn his February 2008 statement to a government investigator, Applicant stated \nthat, at the time he was consuming two to three mixed drinks per weekend. Once a \nmonth he would drink to the point of intoxication, consuming 10 to 15 shots of hard \nliquor in a period of three to four hours. Since May 2007, Applicant has been drinking \nalcohol only when going out to dinner or sometimes at home while watching TV. He \ndoes not believe he has an alcohol problem or alcohol dependency.  \n \nIn his November 18, 2008, response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant stated \nthat he was currently drinking alcohol weekly, anywhere from 2 to 15 ounces, \ndepending on the occasion. He drank wine on a monthly basis, about one to three \nglasses per occasion. He typically would drink to intoxication about every other \nweekend. The last time he was intoxicated was three days before answering the \ninterrogatories, while attending a friend\u2019s wedding. He intends to continue consuming \nalcoholic beverages. He has not received any alcohol counseling. \n \nApplicant also stated that his change of lifestyle - from a student to having a full-\ntime job and moving to another city - has significantly reduced his alcohol consumption. \nHe stated his \u201calcohol consumption has been reduced from becoming intoxicated two to \nthree nights a week, to three to five nights a month\u201d (Item 5). \n \nIn his 2008 security clearance application, Applicant also disclosed that he used \nmarijuana illegally from August 2001 to April 2007. He illegally used marijuana \napproximately 10 to 12 times during this period. In his statement to a government \n\n \n4 \n \n \ninvestigator (Item 4) and in his answer to the SOR, Applicant clarified that his use of \nmarijuana started in the spring of 2003. His last use of marijuana was in February 2008.  \n \nThe first time Applicant used marijuana was out of curiosity. All of the other times \nhe used marijuana, he was under the influence of alcohol. While in college, he used \nmarijuana with his fraternity and Frisbee team friends. He still associates with some of \nthe same college friends with whom he used marijuana. Since April 2007, Applicant has \nused marijuana once. In February 2008, he was visiting friends still at college and \nillegally used marijuana at a party. He claimed this was a unique incident, and before he \nbecame aware that having a security clearance prohibits the use of illegal substances. \nHe used marijuana after he submitted his security clearance application. \n \nApplicant claimed he never purchased marijuana and never possessed any drug \nrelated paraphernalia. Applicant stopped using marijuana because he never had a drive \nto use it. He does not intend to use illegal drugs again in the future. He offered to sign a \nstatement of intent to never use illegal drugs again if that would improve his eligibility to \nreceive a security clearance. He did not submit the statement of intent.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d4 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern about drug involvement: \n \nuse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \n4  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n5  \u201cThe administrative judge considers the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \nAG \u00b6 25 describes eight conditions related to drug involvement that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Two drug involvement disqualifying \nconditions raise a security concern and are disqualifying in this particular case: AG \u00b6 \n25(a): \u201cany drug abuse;\u201d6 and AG \u00b6 25(c): \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia.\u201d  \n \nAppellant admitted he illegally used and possessed marijuana with varying \nfrequency between 2003 and February 2008. His behavior triggers the applicability of \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c).7 The other disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 25 are not \napplicable.  \n  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides four potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation. \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \n \n6  AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \n7  AG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nHaving considered all the mitigating conditions I find that none is fully raised by \nthe record evidence. Applicant\u2019s illegal use of drugs is recent. His last possession and \nuse of illegal drugs was in February 2008, after he submitted his security clearance \napplication. Applicant knew, or should have known, that the use of marijuana is illegal. \nHe was confronted with his past use of marijuana when he completed his e-QIP. \nNotwithstanding, he chose to continue his use of marijuana when he visited his college \nfriends in February 2008. Applicant\u2019s actions do not demonstrate a clear intent to refrain \nfrom any involvement with illegal drugs, a disassociation from drug-using friends, or an \nappropriate period of abstinence. I find the drug involvement concerns are not mitigated. \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n  \nUnder Guideline G the government\u2019s concern is that excessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. AG \u00b6 21. \n \nThe government established its case under Guideline G by showing that from \n2000 until at least November 2008, Applicant established a history of excessive \nconsumption of alcohol, at times to the point of intoxication. He was involved in three \nalcohol-related incidents in 2004, 2005, and 2007. Additionally, he drove while under \nthe influence of alcohol in at least three occasions. Applicant\u2019s excessive alcohol \nconsumption resulted in his exercising questionable judgment. Guideline G disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6 22(a): \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence,\u201d and AG \u00b6 22(c): \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the \npoint of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an \nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has been involved in any alcohol-related \nmisconduct since April 2007. However, available evidence shows Applicant has \ncontinued consuming alcohol and he intends to do so in the future. There is no evidence \nApplicant has received any alcohol counseling or treatment or that he has made any \nlifestyle changes to avoid future alcohol-related problems. \n \n  \nThere are four Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 23 \npotentially applicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);  \n \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \n  \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in this case, I find none of the \nGuideline G mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s sparse favorable evidence is not \nsufficient to fully raise the applicability of any of the mitigating conditions, or to show it is \nunlikely his questionable behavior will recur. I specifically considered that Applicant\u2019s \nlast alcohol-related misconduct was in 2007. Notwithstanding, because of his current \npattern of alcohol consumption and his continued association with his illegal drug and \nalcohol using friends, I cannot find that his behavior was infrequent or that it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. Applicant continues to \nexercise questionable judgment. His behavior raise questions about his reliability and \ntrustworthiness. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n\n \n9 \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 26 years old. \nApparently, he did well while in college and is pursuing an advanced degree. Some of \nhis questionable behavior occurred while he was attending college. He receives credit \nfor his two years working for a government contractor. He also receives favorable credit \nfor disclosing his questionable behavior in his security clearance application. These \nfactors show some responsibility and mitigation. \n \nNotwithstanding, \nsecurity \nconcerns \nremain \nabout \nApplicant\u2019s \ncurrent \nresponsibility, reliability, and judgment. The sparse record evidence fails to convince me \nof Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his alcohol \nconsumption and drug involvement security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nMay 27, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) dated May 30, 2008.  On February 3, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 24, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to another\nAdministrative Judge on March 19, 2009.  It was transferred to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on April 6, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on April 7, 2009,\nscheduling the hearing for April 29, 2009.  The Government offered five exhibits,\nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 5, which were received without objection.\nApplicant offered ten exhibits, referred to Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through J, that were\nadmitted into evidence.  She also testified on her own behalf.  The record remained\nopen until close of business on May 10, 2009 to allow the Applicant the opportunity to\nsubmit additional documentation.  The Applicant submitted nine Post-Hearing Exhibits,\n\n2\nreferred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits, 1 through 9. The transcript of the\nhearing (Tr.) was received on May 7, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nhis testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 25 years old and has a high school\ndiploma and three semesters of college.  She is employed by a defense contractor as a\nNetwork Device Engineer and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection\nwith her employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because she is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits to each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nguideline.  She has twelve separate delinquent accounts totaling approximately\n$80,000.00.  Credit Reports of the Applicant dated June 18, 2008, November 13, 2008\nand March 16, 2009, collectively reflect each of the outstanding debts listed in the SOR.\nThe Applicant has been employed for a defense contractor since May 2008.\n(Government Exhibits 3, 4 and 5).  \nIn 2005, the Applicant had good credit and a good job.  At that time, she had a\nhandful of credit cards and decent credit.  Her parents sold their house, the house the\nApplicant grew up in, to the Applicant, and she was able to financially afford it.  Her\nboyfriend at the time who later became her husband helped her make the payments.\nTogether they brought home about $6,000.00 a month and they spent it.  They did not\nrealize how expensive it was to own a house and started relying on credit cards.\n  \nIn about May 2006, the Applicant and her husband separated.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit J).  For a couple of months he helped her with the household bills and then in\nAugust 2006 he stopped.  This is when her financial problems began.  The Applicant\nwas instantly responsible for the financial support for her and her three children.  In\norder to make ends meet, she used credit cards.  She also bought frivolous things such\nas dinners and movies that were not necessary.  She fell into deep indebtedness.\nAlthough she was contacted by creditors for payment, she did not open her mail and\nwas irresponsible.    \nIn April 2008, the Applicant started attending college in order to improve her\nearning ability but was forced to quit when her child\u2019s father refused to allow their child\n\n3\nto live with her mother.  To avoid conflict and the possibility of losing her child, the\nApplicant quit school and moved back near the location where the child\u2019s father lives.\nWhen the Applicant realized that her job was in jeopardy because of her\ndelinquent debts, she contacted her creditors and tried to set up payment plans,\nsettlement agreements, or started paying the debt.  The Applicant realized that it would\ntake her a long time to resolve her debts but she had been previously advised by her\ntax preparer and her father that it would have a negative impact on her job if she were\nto file bankruptcy.  So, she started trying to resolve her debts on her own.    \n  \nAfter paying her regular monthly expenses, she testified that she had $400.00\nthat she can use to pay her delinquent debts.  Of the delinquent debt listed in the SOR,\n$51,000.00 is a second mortgage on her house that was foreclosed upon; $21,688.00 is\ncredit card debt; and $7,095.00 is for student loans.  These are discussed in detail\nbelow:  \n1(a).  A credit card debt in the amount of $1,642.00, is being paid in monthly\ninstallments of $100.00 a month.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).  \n1(b) and 1(g).  A debt owed to a bank in the amount of $51,000.00 is the second\nmortgage on her house.  A debt to a home loan service in the amount of $207,921.00\nwas for the first mortgage on her home.  Applicant explained that she stopped paying\nher mortgage in order to keep up with her credit card debt because she was using the\ncredit cards to live on.  She thought that she could eventually catch up on the mortgage\npayment, but she was not able to.  She put her house up for sale in order to pay off the\nloan, but it did not sell.  She even made an offer to short sale the house, but the bank\nrejected it.  She tried to get a loan modification but was unable to get one.  In February\n2007, the Applicant defaulted on the house loan and it was foreclosed upon.  Applicant\nindicates that the house has been sold and there are people living in it.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit C). \n1(c).  A credit card debt owed to a bank in the amount of $4,500.00 is being paid\nin monthly installments of $50.00.  Applicant began the payments in about October\n2008, and has been consistently paying them since then.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D).     \n1(d).  A credit card debt owed to a bank in the amount of $5,528.00 remains\noutstanding.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E).\n1(e). and 1(f).  Two credit card debts owed to a bank in the amount of $6,337.00\nand $2,782.00 have a payment plan set up in the amount of $100.00 a month for both\naccounts.  The Applicant\u2019s first payment is scheduled for May 1, 2009.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit F).   \n1(h).  A debt owed to a University in the amount of $850.00 has been paid in full.\n(Tr. p. 90, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G and Post-Hearing Exhibit 6).  \n1(i). and 1(j).  Two student loans owed to a bank in the amounts of $2,614.00\nand $4,481.00 have been consolidated.  The Applicant has set up a payment plan and\nis paying $81.98 a month toward the debt.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H). \n\n4\n1(l).  A debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $4,600.00 was paid in full with\nthe Applicant\u2019s income tax refund.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I).   \nRecently, the Applicant sought out financial counseling.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibit 3).  She discussed her financial problems with her supervisor,\ncoworkers, friends and security officer.  She decided that bankruptcy was her best\noption under the circumstances.  A letter from her bankruptcy attorney indicates that on\nMay 20, 2009, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on her behalf.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibit 5).  Once her debts are discharged, she will be able to get her finances\nback on track.  She has no credit cards.  She states that she has learned to live off of\none salary and support her children by herself.  She understands that she cannot spend\nmoney she does not have, and only buys necessities.  She indicates that in the future,\nshe will continue to decrease her spending habits and make her payments on a timely\nbasis.   \nPresently, the Applicant and her husband are legally separated and their divorce\nis pending.  She does not expect to receive any child support from her husband.  She is\nworking as much overtime as she is allowed.  She and her three children have recently\nmoved back in with her parents.  Her new boyfriend is also living with them and taking\ncare of her children to save her child care expenses.  (Tr. p. 48).         \nA letter of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s supervisor dated April 27, 2009,\nattests to her hardworking nature, skill, conscientiousness and trustworthiness.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).   \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\n\n5\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances:\n20(c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts. \nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\n\n6\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with her security clearance eligibility.\nUnder the particular circumstances of this case, I find that the Applicant has done\nher best, given the excessive nature of the debts, and has made a good faith effort to\nresolve them.  Her separation from her husband and her poor spending habits caused\nher financial demise.  She is now the sole bread winner for her family and understands\nthat she must be financially responsible.  Although she tried to set up payment plans\nwith her creditors and she started making payments toward them, this left her very little\nmoney to live on.  After consulting with a financial counselor and her security officer at\nwork, she hired an attorney and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  Once her debts are\ndischarged, she will have a fresh start.  She should no longer have any problems paying\nher bills on time as she understands the importance of living within ones means.  In the\nevent that she has any future financial problems, her security clearance would\nimmediately be in jeopardy.  Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has\nintroduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to\novercome the Government's case.  \nUnder Guideline F, Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts and, 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.  However,\nMitigating Conditions 20(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\n\n7\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances, 20(c) the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control and, 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness, reliability, candor, a\nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that\nthe person may properly safeguard classified information.  \nThere is evidence of financial rehabilitation at this time.  The Applicant has\ninitiated a good faith effort to repay her overdue creditors or otherwise resolve her\ndebts.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing her request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.g.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n8\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Finding no harmful error, we\n1\naffirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant used methamphetamine\nten times between May 2005 and January 2007. His use was knowing and deliberate.  In 2007 he\nmailed $200 to his brother in another state and asked him to mail Applicant some methamphetamine.\nHis brother mailed him 1.9 grams of methamphetamine.  The shipment was discovered by law\nenforcement personnel.  Applicant was charged with a felony.  Later that year he pled guilty to an\namended charge of illegal possession methamphetamine.  He was sentenced to 24 months probation\nwith deferred judgment (in part).  Applicant\u2019s wife discouraged his use of methamphetamine but he\ndisregarded her advice because he believed he did not have a drug problem, would not get addicted\nand would not get caught.\nOn appeal, Applicant alleges errors in the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.

The SOR \ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under \nthe Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked. \n \nOn April 7, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 30, 2009. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 28, 2009. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled on June 23, 2009. The government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 4, which were admitted without objection (Tr. 13). Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf, presented two witnesses, and submitted Applicant Exhibit (AE) 1 (with Tabs A \nthrough N), which were admitted without objection (Tr. 23). DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 6, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, except for SOR \u00b6 2.a, which he \ndenied. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and \ntestimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old project manager working for a defense contractor. He \ngraduated from college in 1999. He then joined the U.S. Navy Officer Candidate School \nprogram and became a naval aviator. He displayed flight and academic excellence and \nreceived two training commendations in recognition of his outstanding performance.

In November 2003, he lost his flying qualifications due to a \nnumber of flying incidents. He was involuntarily discharged from the Navy in March \n2005. His service was characterized as honorable.  \n \nApplicant started law school in August 2005, and received his law degree in May \n2008. He received an award for being the most outstanding third-year law student in the \nschool\u2019s clinic program. He has not taken his bar exam. Applicant presented numerous \nimpressive character letters from fellow Navy officers and law school students, as well \nas a law school professor. All of his references consider Applicant to be honest, \ntrustworthy, and of high moral character. He was commended for his judgment, \n \n1  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmaturity, outstanding work ethic, and overall performance. All of his references \nrecommended he receive access to classified information without reservations. \n \nHe married his first wife in October 2001. They separated in 2004, because of \nher mental problems, alcohol abuse, and infidelity, and they were divorced in August \n2005. Applicant met his current wife through the Internet around May 2005. Applicant \nmarried his wife in December 2007. He has no children. \n \nApplicant illegally used methamphetamine ten times from approximately May \n2005 to January 1, 2007. He used methamphetamine twice a day on five different \noccasions. Methamphetamine is a highly addictive, illegal drug. He used \nmethamphetamine twice in May 2005, while visiting his twin brother living in another \nstate (Tr. 94). Applicant\u2019s brother is the supplier of all the methamphetamine Applicant \nconsumed. He visited his brother to acquire and use the methamphetamine. Applicant \nused the methamphetamine to avoid feeling tired and to be able to consume more \nalcohol while partying with his brother. His use of methamphetamine was knowing, \ndeliberate, and premeditated. Applicant claimed he did not use illegal drugs while in \ncollege or in the Navy because he knew the use of drugs was illegal and he did not \nwant to lose his career (Tr. 163). \n \nIn May 2005, Applicant brought methamphetamine back with him on his return \nflight home. He consumed the methamphetamine in December 2005, to avoid feeling \ntired and to be able to consume more alcohol (Tr. 95). He used methamphetamine twice \nthe same day. While attending law school, Applicant visited his twin brother during the \n2006 spring break and in November 2006 (Tr. 97). On both occasions, he used \nmethamphetamine with his brother under similar circumstances as those during May \n2005 and December 2005. Applicant brought methamphetamine back with him on his \nreturn flight home in November 2006. He consumed the methamphetamine around late \nDecember 2006 to early January 2007 at a holiday party (Tr. 101). \n \nApplicant told his wife (then girlfriend) about his use of methamphetamine in May \n2005. He also told her about the other four times he used methamphetamine. She has \nnever used illegal drugs, and she discouraged him and advised Applicant against using \nillegal drugs. Applicant disregarded his wife\u2019s advice because he believed he did not \nhave a drug problem, would not get addicted to methamphetamine, and would not get \ncaught by law enforcement. \n \nIn February 2007, Applicant sent $200 to his twin brother living in another state \nand asked him to mail Applicant some methamphetamine (Tr. 137). His brother mailed \nhim 1.9 grams of methamphetamine. The shipment of the illegal drug was discovered \nby law enforcement personnel. In May 2007, Applicant was charged with unlawful \nmethamphetamine conspiracy, a felony. In September 2007, pursuant to a plea \nagreement, Applicant pled guilty to an amended charge of illegal possession of \nmethamphetamine in exchange for a sentence of 24 months probation with deferred \njudgment (in part). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant decided he would never use drugs again when he saw the police \nofficers coming into his home in February 2007 (Tr. 147). As a result of this incident, \nApplicant realized he had not exercised good judgment. He believes this is not the type \nof future he envisioned for himself and his wife. Between July 2007 and December \n2007, at the suggestion of his wife, Applicant underwent grief counseling to identify the \nroot of his bad decisions. Applicant believes his use of methamphetamine was a way of \nhim coping with the devastating losses he suffered in a relatively short period, i.e., in \n2003, he lost his flight status; he had marital problems in 2004, and divorced his first \nwife in August 2006; he was involuntarily discharged from the Navy in 2005; his twin \nbrother was diagnosed with AIDS in 2004; he was very close to his grandmother and \nshe died in February 2005; and his older brother died in June 2006 of AIDS. Applicant \nhad problems coping with all these setbacks and was not able to talk to others about his \npersonal problems. \n \nIn September 2007, the court required Applicant to undergo a drug assessment. \nThe state counselor concluded Applicant was not drug dependent and recommended \nno further drug counseling (Tr. 120). She recommended, however, that Applicant \ncontinue his grief counseling. During the course of his probation, Applicant took three \ndrug tests, all of which came back negative for illegal drugs. Applicant successfully \ncompleted his 24-month probation with all of its requirements. \n \nSince February 2007, Applicant has had limited interaction with his brother. He \nhas not been back to his brother\u2019s home since December 2006. He had contact with his \nbrother in July 2007 (Tr. 140) and December 2008, at his parent\u2019s home, and his \nbrother visited Applicant\u2019s home in July and November 2008 (Tr. 124). Applicant tries to \ncontrol the environment and circumstances under which he meets with his brother to \nprevent exposing himself to illegal drugs. To his knowledge, his brother continues to \nabuse illegal drugs. \n \nApplicant started working for his current employer, a government contractor, in \nJune 2008. His direct supervisor is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and part-owner of \nthe company. The CEO and Applicant have weekly phone contact and monthly personal \ncontact (Tr. 24-34). In his opinion, Applicant is doing an outstanding job. Applicant is \nperforming beyond all expectations and a promotion is pending. The customer (a \ngovernment agency) is well pleased with Applicant\u2019s performance and recommended \nhis promotion. Applicant received a monetary award and a letter of commendation for \nhis outstanding job performance.  \n \nThe CEO is aware of all the SOR allegations against Applicant. He believes \nApplicant made some bad decisions and exercised poor judgment. Applicant disclosed \nhis drug use and criminal charges in detail in his security clearance application and \ndiscussed his problems with the CEO. The CEO considers Applicant to be honest, \ntruthful, and reliable. He recommended Applicant receive access to classified \ninformation without reservations. Applicant has been handling a $25 million dollar \ncontract for the company with great success and is well liked by the client.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for all of his illegal behavior. He was candid and \nforthcoming explaining the circumstances surrounding his and his brother\u2019s use of \ndrugs, the stress he underwent during the criminal proceedings against him, and the \nshame and embarrassment he felt. He believes that many of his law school fellow \nstudents became aware of his legal situation. He understands that for him to achieve his \ngoals in life there is no room in his future for drugs or any illegal activity. Applicant \nsigned a statement of intent in which he promised never to use illegal drugs again (Tr. \n128; AE 1, Tab N).  \n \nApplicant believes he has learned his lesson and is rehabilitated. Since his \ncriminal activity, he moved to a different state, married his wife, graduated from law \nschool, and has been successfully working for a government contractor. Applicant \nintends to continue his contacts with his brother, but under circumstances where \nApplicant can control the circumstances and situation of their meetings. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \n\n \n6 \n \n \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nUnder Guideline J, the security concern is that criminal activity \u201ccreates doubt \nabout a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 30.  \n \n \nBetween May 2005 and January 2007, Applicant knowingly and deliberately used \nmethamphetamine approximately 10 times. He used methamphetamine twice a day on \nfive different occasions. Applicant traveled by airplane to visit his brother in another \nstate and to acquire and use the methamphetamine. On three occasions, Applicant \nbrought back methamphetamine in the airplane to use at home at a later time. \nFurthermore, Applicant purchased 1.9 grams of methamphetamine from his brother and \nhad it mailed to him across interstate lines. He was charged with unlawful \nmethamphetamine conspiracy. He pled guilty to an amended charge of illegal \npossession of methamphetamine. Applicant\u2019s drug-related behavior violated state and \nfederal criminal laws. \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior raises security concerns under AG \u00b6 31(a) \u201ca single serious \ncrime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and AG \u00b6 31(c) \u201callegation or admission of criminal \n\n \n7 \n \n \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted.\u201d  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 lists four conditions that could mitigate the criminal conduct security \nconcerns raised under AG \u00b6 31: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nAfter considering all the mitigating conditions, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 32 (a) and (d) \npartially apply. Applicant\u2019s last use of methamphetamine was in January 2007; his last \ncriminal behavior occurred in February 2007; and he pled guilty to unlawful possession \nof methamphetamine in September 2007. As such his criminal behavior may be \nconsidered somewhat remote. \n \n \nApplicant averred his criminal behavior was caused by unusual circumstances \nand that it is unlikely to recur. He claimed he used methamphetamine to cope with the \ndevastating losses he suffered in a relatively short period, i.e., losing his flight status in \n2003; the 2004 diagnosis of his twin brother with AIDS; the marital problems in 2004 \nthat led to his divorce from his first wife in 2006; his involuntary discharge from the Navy \nin 2005; the death of his grandmother in 2005; and the death of his older brother to \nAIDS in 2006.  \n \n \nSince July 2007, Applicant successfully underwent grief counseling, participated \nin a state-sponsored drug assessment that indicated he is not drug dependent, \nsuccessfully completed his 24-month probation, purchased a home, married his current \nwife, graduated from law school, and has been highly successful working for a \ngovernment contractor. There is no evidence that Applicant has been involved in any \nadditional drug-related incidents or any other misconduct after February 2007. He was \ncandid in his responses to the security clearance application questions, to his \nsupervisor\u2019s questions, and at his hearing when discussing the circumstances \nsurrounding his drug-related offenses. I find this evidence weighs towards a finding of \nsuccessful rehabilitation, but does not fully mitigate the Guideline J security concerns. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                           \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern about drug involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes eight conditions related to drug involvement that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Two drug involvement disqualifying \nconditions raise a security concern and are disqualifying in this particular case: AG \u00b6 \n25(a): \u201cany drug abuse;\u201d2 and AG \u00b6 25(c): \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia.\u201d  \n \nBetween May 2005 and January 2007, Appellant illegally used and possessed \nmethamphetamine approximately 10 times. He used methamphetamine twice a day in \nfive different occasions. Applicant traveled by airplane to visit his brother in another \nstate and to use and acquire the methamphetamine. On three occasions, Applicant \nbrought back methamphetamine in the airplane to his home state to use it at a later \ntime. Furthermore, Applicant purchased 1.9 grams of methamphetamine from his \nbrother and had it mailed to him across interstate lines. His behavior triggers the \napplicability of AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c).3 The other disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 \n25 are not applicable.  \n  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides four potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n \n2  AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \n3  AG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Cocaine and methamphetamine are Schedule II Controlled Substances. See 21 U.S.C \u00a7 \n812(c)II(a)(4) (cocaine), and II(c) (methamphetamine); United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458 (2nd Cir. \n2008) (cocaine); United States v. Wheeler, 535 F.3d 446 (6th Cir. 2008) (methamphetamine).  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation. \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26 (a) and (b) are partially established by the record evidence. Applicant\u2019s \nillegal use of methamphetamine is somewhat remote. His last possession and use of \nmethamphetamine was in January 2007, and his last drug-related misconduct was in \nFebruary 2007. Because Applicant used methamphetamine ten times (twice in five \ndifferent occasions) between May 2005 and January 2007, I do not find his use was \ninfrequent.  \n \nApplicant averred his use of methamphetamine occurred under unusual \ncircumstances and it is unlikely to recur. He believes his use of methamphetamine was \na way to cope with the devastating losses he suffered in a relatively short period, i.e., in \n2003, he lost his flight status and his naval career in 2005; he had marital problems in \n2004, and divorced his first wife in August 2006; his twin brother was diagnosed with \nAIDS in 2004; he was very close to his grandmother and she died in February 2005; and \nhis older brother died in June 2006. Applicant had problems coping with all these \nsetbacks and talking to people about his personal problems. \n \nI disagree with the conclusion that Applicant\u2019s use of methamphetamine occurred \nunder unusual circumstances and it is unlikely to recur. Applicant did not use illegal \ndrugs while in college or in the Navy because he was concerned its use would adversely \naffect his career. In May 2005, when he used methamphetamine for the first time, he \nwas 32 years old. He had just been discharged from the Navy after serving \napproximately five years as an officer and naval aviator. He was about to start law \n\n \n10 \n \n \nschool. Applicant knew the use of methamphetamine was illegal and dangerous to his \nhealth.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b)(1)-26(b)(4) are partially established by the evidence. Applicant intends \nto continue having contact with his twin brother, who was the source of all of Applicant\u2019s \nmethamphetamine and who used the illegal drug with Applicant. To Applicant\u2019s \nknowledge, his brother is still using illegal drugs. Applicant claimed he has somewhat \ndisassociated from his brother by controlling the circumstances under which they meet. \nHe has not visited his brother at his home and has not been in parties with him to avoid \nthe environment in which the methamphetamine was used.  \n \nApplicant receives credit for his two-year period of abstinence while on probation, \nhis successful grief counseling, and for his positive drug assessment. He also receives \nfull credit for his signed statement of intent not to use illegal drugs with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation. \n \nApplicant told his girlfriend (now his wife) about his use of methamphetamine \nevery time he used it. She was opposed to his use of methamphetamine and advised \nhim against using it. Notwithstanding, Applicant deliberately sought out the use of \nmethamphetamine. He visited his brother in another state where he acquired and used \nmethamphetamine. Additionally, he brought methamphetamine with him in the plane for \nlater use. Moreover, Applicant purchased methamphetamine from his brother and had it \nmailed to his home. \n \nConsidering \nall \nthe \nfacts \nand \nthe \ntimelines \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nuse \nof \nmethamphetamine and the losses he suffered, I do not find his use of \nmethamphetamine occurred under such unusual circumstances as to make it unlikely \nthat he would use methamphetamine again. I find the drug involvement concerns are not \nmitigated. In reaching my conclusion, I also considered Applicant\u2019s statement of intent \nnot to use illegal drugs again, his limited association with his brother, and Applicant\u2019s \nperiod of abstinence.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n11 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature and well-\neducated man. He served honorably for five years in the Navy as an officer and naval \naviator. He has been very successful working for a defense contractor. He has \nestablished a reputation as a valuable, dedicated and reliable employee. There is no \nevidence he has ever compromised classified information or committed any security \nviolations. Applicant expressed remorse for his questionable behavior and seems \nresolute in remaining abstinent. He successfully completed his grief counseling, and his \ndrug assessment determined he is not drug dependent. Additionally, Applicant is \nmarried and in a stable relationship. He has been drug abstinent since January 2007, \nand promised never to use illegal drugs again. These factors show responsibility, good \njudgment, and mitigation. \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant acted deliberately and with premeditation in his use \nof methamphetamine notwithstanding his knowledge of the illegality of his actions and \nthe risks associated with it. He continued his use of methamphetamine even though his \nwife asked him not to use illegal drugs. Applicant\u2019s bold disregard for the law escalated \nto the point of him ordering methamphetamine to be delivered to him through the mail. \nHe compromised himself and his brother. It is questionable whether Applicant would \nhave discontinued his methamphetamine use but for his being discovered and \nprosecuted. \n \nOn balance, I conclude that, at this time, Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence is \ninsufficient to mitigate the security concerns arising from his criminal conduct and drug \ninvolvement. Considering the totality of the circumstances in this case, Applicant\u2019s two-\nyear abstinence while under probation is not sufficient to show reliability, judgment, and \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Overall, the record evidence fails to \nconvince me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Voelker, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 12, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 25, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nThe Judge\u2019s finding in Applicant\u2019s favor under SOR allegation 1.b is not at issue in this appeal.\n1\n2\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge made harmful errors in\nhis findings of fact; whether the Judge erred in his application of the Guidelines H and J mitigating\nconditions; and whether the Judge erred in his whole person analysis.   Finding no harmful error, we\n1\naffirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant used methamphetamine\nten times between May 2005 and January 2007. His use was knowing and deliberate.  In 2007 he\nmailed $200 to his brother in another state and asked him to mail Applicant some methamphetamine.\nHis brother mailed him 1.9 grams of methamphetamine.  The shipment was discovered by law\nenforcement personnel.  Applicant was charged with a felony.  Later that year he pled guilty to an\namended charge of illegal possession methamphetamine.  He was sentenced to 24 months probation\nwith deferred judgment (in part).

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to consider record\nevidence favorable to Applicant; whether the Judge erred in her application of the pertinent\nmitigating conditions; and whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nFinding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant is a support specialist working for a federal contractor.

In the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge noted the circumstances outside\nApplicant\u2019s control that affected his financial condition.  She also noted his good work record and\nhis record of achievement in the Army.  However, she concluded that Applicant had not begun to\naddress his delinquent debts until relatively recently and that, as a consequence, he failed to meet his\nburden of persuasion as to mitigation.   \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider favorable evidence, such as the extent to\nwhich he is attempting to resolve his financial problems and his evidence of his good work ethic and\nreliability.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing  \n(e-QIP) on June 11, 2008. On January 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concern \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn March 2, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on March 17, 2009. \nThe case was assigned to me on March 20, 2009. Scheduling the hearing was delayed \nbecause Applicant was on temporary duty out of the area until May 2009. On June 22, \n2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for July 15, 2009. The \ncase was heard on that date. The Government offered four exhibits which were \nadmitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 4. The Applicant testified and offered four \nAugust 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nexhibits which were admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - D. The \nrecord was held open until July 28, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional \ndocuments. He requested an extension until August 5, 2009. His request was granted. \nHe timely submitted a 14-page document that was admitted as AE E. Department \nCounsel\u2019s response to AE E is marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The transcript was \nreceived on July 22, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, \nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nAmendment to SOR \n \n \nThe Government moved to amend the SOR to conform with the evidence \nprovided by Applicant during the hearing under \u00b6 E3.1.17 to add the following \nparagraph: \n \n \n1.ll  You are indebted to the federal government in the approximate \namount of $17,000 for back taxes owed for tax year 2003.   \n \nApplicant had no objection to the amendment. The motion to amend the SOR \nwas granted. Applicant was permitted to submit additional documentation that was \nrelevant to this allegation after the hearing. (Tr at 50 \u2013 56) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.t, \n1.u, 1.x, 1.y, and 1.ff.  He admits the remaining SOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old test support specialist employed by a Department of \nDefense contractor seeking a security clearance. He has been employed with this \ncompany since September 2007. From September 1989 to September 1995, he served \non active duty in the United States Army. He was an air traffic controller. He separated \nas an E-4 with an honorable discharge. His DD FORM 214 indicates the reason for \nseparation was due to a reduction in force. He held a security clearance while in the \nmilitary. He is divorced and has three children, two sons, ages 13 and 14, and a \ndaughter, age 12. (Tr at 5-7, 24-25, Gov 1; AE E at 15)  \n \nOn June 11, 2008, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) in order to apply for a security clearance. A \nsubsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant has financial issues. The \nSOR alleged 37 delinquent accounts totaling approximately $25,328. Of the 37 debts, \n27 debts are medical debts. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1,d, 1.f \u2013 1.o, 1.u, 1.ww \u2013 1.ee, 1.gg \u2013 1.kk) \nThe medical debts total $10,516. The consumer debts total $14,812. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.e, 1.p \u2013 1.t, 1.v, and 1.ff) Approximately $12,200 of the consumer debt relates to an \nautomobile repossession. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) During the hearing, Applicant revealed that he \nowes the Internal Revenue Service approximately $17,000 for tax year 2003. (Tr at 50-\n51)     \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant states that his financial problems are the result of his divorce in 1999. \nHis child support is $900 a month. His priority is his monthly child support payment.  He \nwas not paid well enough in some of his previous jobs to pay his debts as well as child \nsupport. As a result, some debts have not been paid over the years. The medical debts \nare the result of Applicant having no health insurance for several years after separating \nfrom the military. Applicant injured his knee in August 2000, requiring numerous visits to \ndoctors over the years. He describes his medical condition as inflammation of the knee \njoints. He recently received a diagnosis of gout. (Tr at 16-18, 44, 57; Answer to SOR) \n \nApplicant\u2019s current job provides health insurance. Applicant believes his current \njob gives him an opportunity to earn a good living. He is working towards resolving his \ndebts. In early 2003, he went to consumer credit counseling after his truck was \nrepossessed. He did not enter into a repayment plan because he was unable to make \npayments. He consulted consumer credit counseling again in September 2008, but did \nnot enter into a repayment plan at that time either. In early July 2009, he consulted a \nbankruptcy attorney about filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 13. He has not formally \nfiled bankruptcy out of concern it would be detrimental to his case. He paid some of the \nsmaller debts. His plan is to take care of the debts under $400 and then file for \nbankruptcy under Chapter 13.

(See AE A at 3-4; AE B at 1, \n3) \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant was asked whether he owed any back taxes to the \nstate or federal government. He admitted that he owes the Internal Revenue Service \napproximately $17,000 for tax year 2003. He was an independent owner/operator \nduring that year. He did not file federal taxes for tax year 2003. The Internal Revenue \nService first contacted Applicant in January 2009 about this debt. Applicant recently \nretained a law firm to represent him in this matter. He intends to submit an offer in \ncompromise. No formal offer in compromise had been submitted prior to the hearing. (Tr \nat 50 \u2013 56; AE D) The status of the tax debt at the close of the record is unresolved.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s pay varies based on the amount of overtime he earns each pay \nperiod.  His net bi-weekly pay for the pay period ending on May 29, 2009, was \n$1,193.81. His net bi-weekly pay for the pay period ending on May 15, 2009, was \n$1,269.15. His net bi-weekly pay for the pay period ending on May 1, 2009, was \n$1,363.42. (AE C)  His child support is automatically deducted from his pay check. He is \npaid every two weeks.  After expenses, Applicant has approximately $200 left over each \nmonth. He was going to submit a budget after the hearing. A budget was not submitted \nin his post-hearing submissions. (Tr at 49, 58) \n \nApplicant does not believe he is a security risk. He has been promoted twice over \nthe past six months. (Tr at 19-20)  He received top ratings in a performance appraisal \ncovering the period of January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2008. (AE E at 6-12) He \nreceived a certificate of appreciation on March 27, 2008. (AE E at 3) \n \nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend testified on his behalf.  She and Applicant have dated for \nthree years. Applicant is a wonderful father and tries very hard to provide for his \nchildren. He is working hard to get his debt under control. She works for the same \ndirectorate as Applicant but not directly with him. She states that Applicant is well \nrespected by the command. (Tr at 60-62)  \n \nThe commander of the directorate where Applicant works wrote a letter on \nApplicant\u2019s behalf. He indicates Applicant has worked in his command for over a year. \nHe has only positive things to say about Applicant\u2019s work ethic, trustworthiness, and \ncharacter. (AE E at 4) Applicant\u2019s supervisor, a senior program officer, states Applicant \nis an indispensable asset. He is always willing to take on additional tasks or \nassignments. Applicant\u2019s attention to detail, exemplary dedication to duty and mission \naccomplishment, and untiring work ethic have paid huge dividends to both the \norganization and the customers. (AE E At 5)     \n \nDuring his active duty Army service, Applicant was awarded the Army \nAchievement Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service \nMedal, the Southwest Asia Service Medal (3rd Award), the Army Service Ribbon, the \nOverseas Service Ribbon, the Kuwait Liberation Medal, the Expert Marksmanship \n\n \n7 \n \n \nQualification Badge With Grenade Bar, and the Sharpshooter Marksmanship \nQualification Badge M-16. (AE E at 15)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n\n \n8 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant encountered financial \ndifficulties since 1999 as a result of his divorce and separation from active duty in the \nUnited States Army.  The SOR alleged 37 delinquent accounts with an approximate \ntotal balance of $25,328. Applicant also owes the Internal Revenue Service \napproximately $17,000 for unpaid taxes for tax year 2003.  \n \nThe government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005)).  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. Most \nof Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts remain unresolved. While Applicant resolved several \nof his delinquent accounts and is in the early stages of anticipating bankruptcy, it will \ntake some time to resolve his financial problems. Applicant has a significant number of \ndelinquent accounts. Of the 37 debts alleged in the SOR, 20 are under $200 which \nindicates a lack of attention to finances rather than an inability to pay. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial issues raise questions about his reliability and good judgment.    \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \n\n \n9 \n \n \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part, due to Applicant\u2019s divorce. \nHowever, Applicant has been divorced for over 10 years. While he has a large child \nsupport payment, it does not explain all of his delinquent accounts. After separating \nfrom active duty, Applicant found employment but the employers did not provide health \ninsurance. It is noted that 27 of the 37 debts alleged in the SOR are medical accounts. \nThe total amount of the medical debt is $10,516. The total amount of the consumer debt \nis $14,812. Of that amount $12,220 relates to a truck repossession in 2003. Applicant \ndoes not appear to be spending extravagantly. However, he has numerous delinquent \naccounts with small balances and a substantial tax debt. He did not take action towards \nresolving his remaining delinquent accounts and his tax debt until recently. I cannot \nconclude that he has acted responsibly under the circumstances. For this reason, FC \nMC \u00b6 20(b) is given less weight.   \n \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant has consulted with consumer credit counseling on two \noccasions but never entered into a repayment plan. He recently consulted a bankruptcy \nattorney about filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 and a tax attorney about \nsubmitting an offer in compromise related to the tax debt. However, the documents \nprovided at hearing indicate that the consultations are in the preliminary stages. \nApplicant is still in the midst of his financial problems.   \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.h, 1.t, 1.v, 1.x, and 1.y.  However, the remaining debts are unresolved. \nApplicant has had no contact for several years with many of his creditors including the \nInternal Revenue Service. He just recently started to look at options for resolving his \n$17,000 tax debt as well as a potential bankruptcy filing. Overall, Applicant has not \nmade a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent accounts.  \n \nFC MC \u00b620(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) does not apply. While Applicant disputes the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.ff, he  \nprovided no evidence that he formally disputed the debt. He has not demonstrated that \nthere is a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the debt.  \n \nMost of the delinquent accounts remain unresolved. It is too soon to conclude \nthat he has mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.    \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n\n \n10 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s active duty \nservice in the United States Army and the highly favorable recommendations of his \ncurrent employer. I considered that his divorce in 1999 caused financial problems.  \nHowever, the divorce occurred ten years ago and much of the debt was incurred after \nthe divorce. I considered that Applicant is current on his child support obligations. I \nconsidered he incurred medical debt because he had no health insurance.  While \nApplicant is highly regarded by his employer, his financial situation remains in question. \nIt is premature to conclude Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable clearance decision.  He did not mitigate the concerns raised under financial \nconsiderations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.v:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.w:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.x:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.y:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.z:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.aa:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.bb:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.cc:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.dd:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.ee:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.ff:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.gg:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.hh:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.ii:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.jj:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.kk:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.ll:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Garcia, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nWillie Ann Towne Willcox, Esq.\n\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 11, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On January 28, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Joan Caton\nAnthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding that\nthe Government had met its burden of production; whether certain of the Judge\u2019s factual findings\nwere in error; whether the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations were in error; and whether the Judge\u2019s\nadverse security clearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no harmful\nerror, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is divorced and the parent\nof a 12-year-old child.  A high school graduate, she is employed as a secretary by a government\ncontractor.  She has held a security clearance since 2001.\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties are the basis for the security concerns in this case.  She has\nnumerous delinquent debts, for such things as consumer goods, medical expenses, an automobile\npurchase, and unpaid taxes.  Applicant was discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2002.  In 2003\nand again in 2004 Applicant petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, but both times her petition was\ndismissed for failure to make payments.  \nApplicant married in 1995, divorcing in 2006.  She incurred significant legal costs as a result\nof the legal proceedings attending the divorce.  Applicant and her ex-husband share custody of their\nchild and are both responsible for the child\u2019s tuition in a private school.  However, the ex-husband\nwas injured on the job in January 2009 and has been unable to work since.  Consequently, Applicant\nhas assumed responsibility for the full amount of tuition payments.\nApplicant lives with her child and her mother in an apartment.  Applicant and her mother\nshare expenses.  Applicant has consulted a bankruptcy attorney and two counseling firms about her\ndebts.  However, at the close of the record, she had not made a decision as to how to resolve her\nindebtedness.  \nThe Judge stated, \u201cApplicant has experienced financial difficulties since at least 2001, and\nshe has sought bankruptcy protection three times.  Most of the debts alleged in the SOR remain\nunpaid and unresolved.  Applicant\u2019s financial problems began when she was a mature adult, and she\nfailed to address her delinquent debts for a significant period, a decision that raises concerns about\nher judgment and reliability.\u201d  Decision at 8.  Accordingly, the Judge concluded that Applicant had\nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising in her case.\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding that her financial condition raised\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.19(a): \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts[.]\u201d\n1\nDirective \u00b6 E2.19(c): \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations[.]\u201d \n2\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FCDC) 19(a)  and 19(c).   We have considered\n1\n2\nApplicant\u2019s argument in light of her admissions to the SOR and the record evidence as a whole.  The\nextent of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts, some of which go back to the early 2000s, and evidence that\nshe twice filed for bankruptcy protection after recently having had her debts discharged under\nChapter 7 of the bankruptcy code, raise reasonable questions about Applicant\u2019s ability or willingness\nto satisfy her debts and certainly constitute a history of her not meeting financial obligations.\nAccordingly, the Judge properly evaluated the case in the context of Applicant\u2019s burden of\npersuasion as to mitigation.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 (After the Government presents evidence\nraising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns.)\nApplicant challenges some of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  For example, she contends that\none of the debts, $345 owed for cell phone services, was previously discharged in bankruptcy, rather\nthan remaining unpaid, as alleged in the SOR and found by the Judge.  However, Applicant admitted\nthis SOR allegation, relieving Department Counsel of any further requirement of proof.  Moreover,\nthe document which Applicant cites in support of her contention that the debt was discharged does\nnot reference this debt, and Applicant did not show that the debt was scheduled and discharged in\n2002.  Rather, the document, Government Exhibit (GE) 9, appears to be the result of a Lexis search\nthat lists the dates pertinent to the Chapter 7 bankruptcy but does not actually mention specific debts.\nFurthermore, even if the debt had been scheduled, its discharge would not have precluded it from\nbeing disqualifying under FCDC 19(a) and 19(c), and a discharge, by itself, is not necessarily\nmitigating under FCMC 20(d).  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001).\nThere is no error in the Judge\u2019s finding.\nApplicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that her two Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings were\ndismissed due to non-payment.  Applicant admits that the 2003 bankruptcy was dismissed because\nshe failed to make payments.  Tr. at 58-59.  But, she contends that the 2004 case was dismissed on\nher own motion, to facilitate the sale of a house.  Applicant Brief at 17.  GE 6, U.S. Bankruptcy\nCourt Docket Report at 2-3, demonstrates that both the Trustee in Bankruptcy and Applicant filed\nmotions to dismiss the 2004 Chapter 13 petition.  The Trustee filed the motion due to alleged non-\npayment; no reason is given for Applicant\u2019s motion.  GE 6 further demonstrates that the Bankruptcy\nJudge granted Applicant\u2019s motion.  Therefore, the Judge\u2019s finding regarding the 2004 filing is not\nsupported by the record.  However, examining this error in light of the record as a whole, we\nconclude that, even if it had not occurred, it is unlikely that the Judge would have decided the case\ndifferently.  Therefore, the error is harmless.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 08-07528 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec.\n29, 2009); ISCR Case No. 01-23362 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006).  Other than this, the Judge\u2019s\nmaterial findings of security concern are based upon substantial record evidence.  See  Directive  \u00b6\nE3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d) \nApplicant states that she challenges the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  The Directive\nrequires us to give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  In this\n\ncase, Applicant\u2019s challenge appears to be merely disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nrecord evidence.  Accordingly, we find no basis to conclude that the Judge\u2019s credibility\ndeterminations were in error.  \nApplicant claims that the Judge erred in her application of the pertinent mitigating conditions,\ncontending, inter alia, that Applicant had promised to pay off her delinquent debts once she \u201cclears\nall of the discrepancies found in her credit report.\u201d   See, e.g., Applicant Brief at 11.  However,\npromises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying\ndebts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible way.  See, e. g., ADP Case\nNo. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999).\nWe have considered the Judge\u2019s treatment of the pertinent mitigating conditions and find no error\nin them.  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,\n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The Judge\u2019s adverse decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cAny doubt\nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2(b).   \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

For example, she contends that one of the debts, $345 owed for cell phone services, was previously discharged in bankruptcy, rather than remaining unpaid, as alleged in the SOR and found by the Judge. However, Applicant admitted this SOR allegation, relieving Department Counsel of any further requirement of proof. Moreover, the document which Applicant cites in support of her contention that the debt was discharged does not reference this debt, and Applicant did not show that the debt was scheduled and discharged in 2002. Rather, the document, Government Exhibit (GE) 9, appears to be the result of a Lexis search that lists the dates pertinent to the Chapter 7 bankruptcy but does not actually mention specific debts. Furthermore, even if the debt had been scheduled, its discharge would not have precluded it from being disqualifying under FCDC 19(a) and 19(c), and a discharge, by itself, is not necessarily mitigating under FCMC 20(d). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001). There is no error in the Judge\u2019s finding. Applicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that her two Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings were dismissed due to non-payment. Applicant admits that the 2003 bankruptcy was dismissed because she failed to make payments. Tr. at 58-59. But, she contends that the 2004 case was dismissed on her own motion, to facilitate the sale of a house. Applicant Brief at 17. GE 6, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Docket Report at 2-3, demonstrates that both the Trustee in Bankruptcy and Applicant filed motions to dismiss the 2004 Chapter 13 petition. The Trustee filed the motion due to alleged non- payment; no reason is given for Applicant\u2019s motion. GE 6 further demonstrates that the Bankruptcy Judge granted Applicant\u2019s motion. Therefore, the Judge\u2019s finding regarding the 2004 filing is not supported by the record. However, examining this error in light of the record as a whole, we conclude that, even if it had not occurred, it is unlikely that the Judge would have decided the case differently. Therefore, the error is harmless. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-07528 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009); ISCR Case No. 01-23362 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006). Other than this, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are based upon substantial record evidence. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.

Garcia, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n_______________ \n \nDecision \n________________ \n \n \nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I conclude that \nApplicant failed to rebut or mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. Her eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF-86) \non June 29, 2007. On August 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn September 30, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to \nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nNovember 3, 2009. A Notice of Hearing was issued on November 5, 2009. On \nJanuary 28, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \nNovember 23, 2009, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \n \nThe Government called no witnesses and introduced nine exhibits, which were \nmarked Ex. 1 through Ex. 9 and admitted without objection. Applicant testified on her \nown behalf and called one witness. She introduced two exhibits, which were marked as \nEx. A and Ex. B and admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of \nthe hearing on December 2, 2009.    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains 17 allegations which raised security concerns under AG F, \nFinancial Considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.q.) In her Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted 13 allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c., 1.e. through 1.l., and 1.p. \nthrough 1.q.). The debts that Applicant admitted totaled approximately $19,311. She \ndenied four SOR allegations at \u00b6\u00b6 1.d., 1.m., 1.n., and 1.o. The debts that Applicant \ndenied totaled approximately $3,631.50. Applicant\u2019s admissions are included herein as \nfindings of fact.  (Applicant Answer to SOR.) \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old, divorced, and the parent of a 12-year-old son. She is a \nhigh school graduate and employed as a secretary by a government contractor. She \nhas worked for her present employer since 1996. She has held a security clearance \nsince 2001.  (Ex. 1; Tr. 74.) \n \n \nApplicant and her former husband share joint custody of their son. They are also \njointly responsible for paying their son\u2019s tuition at a private school. Pursuant to a \nconsent order dated September 19, 2008, the ex-husband is obligated to pay Applicant \n$100 each month toward their son\u2019s tuition. Applicant is responsible for paying the \nremaining tuition each month. However, her ex-husband was injured on the job in \nJanuary 2009, and he has been unable to work since that time. He has not paid his \nshare of the son\u2019s tuition during the 2009-2010 school year. Consequently, Applicant \npays $546 in tuition for her son\u2019s education each month. (Ex. 1; Ex. 2 at 39-40; Tr. 67, \n74-77, 82-83.) \n \n \nApplicant and her former husband married in 1995.  They separated in 2005, and \nthey were divorced in 2006. Applicant had significant legal expenses connected with the \ndivorce. In the early years of their marriage, Applicant and her husband incurred a \nnumber of debts. The SOR alleges at \u00b6 1.q. that, in 2001, Applicant petitioned for \nChapter 7 bankruptcy. In September 2002, the bankruptcy court discharged their \ndebts.1 In about January 2003, Applicant petitioned individually for Chapter 13 \n \n1 In an interview with an authorized investigator on July 12, 2001, Applicant stated that she and her \nhusband had filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. At the interview, she provided a financial statement \nshowing that she and her husband had $27,000 in debts and were required to make monthly payments of \n$459 on the Chapter 13 bankruptcy. The record supports a conclusion that Applicant filed for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy in 2001, and the filing then was changed to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which was discharged in \nSeptember 2002.  (Ex. 8 at 1-4; Ex. 9.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \nbankruptcy. Her petition was dismissed in about August 2003 for failure to make the \nrequired payments to the trustee.2 In December 2004, Applicant again petitioned for \nChapter 13 bankruptcy. In October 2005, Applicant\u2019s petition was dismissed for non-\npayment. Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcies are alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.p. The \ngovernment conceded that the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i. and 1.j. were duplicates \nwith the same account number and had been discharged in Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy. (SOR; Ex. 1; Ex. 6 at 3; Ex. 8; Tr. 56-60, 93-94, 97-98.)   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. alleged that Applicant owed a debt of $345 on an account that had \nbeen placed for collection and, as of June 3, 2009, had not been paid. Applicant \nidentified the debt as a cell phone bill. The debt was listed as an unpaid collection \naccount on Applicant\u2019s credit bureau reports of June 3, 2009 and October 14, 2009. \nApplicant failed to provide information establishing that the debt had been paid or \nsettled. (Ex. 2 at 4; Ex. 3; Ex. 4; Tr. 35.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.b. that Applicant owed a $1,480 debt, in collection status, \nto a jewelry store, and, as of June 3, 2009, the debt had not been paid. In her answer to \nDOHA interrogatories, Applicant provided documentation showing that she had made \n11 small payments of $50 and $25 on the debt in 2007. Applicant received notice from \nthe creditor on January 21, 2009, that her account balance was $1,480. She stated that \nshe had made no payments on the debt in 2009 because the creditor would only accept \nlarge payments. The debt remains unresolved.  (Ex. 2 at 54-65; Tr. 35-37.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.c. that Applicant was indebted to a medical creditor on \nan unpaid delinquent debt of $242. Applicant incurred the debt when she had dental \nbraces in 2002 or 2003. She stated that she had paid the debt and intended to dispute \nthe debt with the credit reporting agencies. She failed to provide a record or receipt to \ncorroborate her statement that the debt had been paid, settled, or disputed. (Ex. 3 at 1; \nTr. 37-40.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.d. that Applicant owed a $29 delinquent debt to a \ncreditor and, as of June 3, 2009, the debt had not been paid. In her response to the \nSOR, Applicant denied the debt. The debt appeared on Applicant\u2019s credit bureau \nreports of January and October 2009. At her hearing, Applicant acknowledged the debt, \nsaid she had overlooked it, and stated that she would pay it at a future date. (Ex. 2 at \n107; Ex. 3 at 1; Tr. 40-41.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant was responsible for two delinquent state tax \nliens.  SOR \u00b6 1.e. alleged that in November 2003, a state tax lien of approximately \n$1,539 had been filed against Applicant and remained unsatisfied as of June 3, 2009. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. alleged that in December 2002, a state tax lien of approximately $2,442 had \nbeen filed against Applicant and remained unsatisfied as of June 3, 2009. Applicant \n \n \n2 Applicant admitted that her payments to the trustee were late, but she denied that she failed to make \nthe payments. (Tr. 57.)  \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncontacted the state tax agency in January 2009 about the liens. She lacked the required \nfunds to resolve the liens through the state\u2019s tax amnesty program, and, because of her \nfinancial history, the state would not enter a financial agreement with her for repayment \nof the liens. To satisfy the liens, the state intercepted Applicant\u2019s state tax refunds. The \nstate taxing authority also told Applicant she could send in additional money to satisfy \nthe liens. However, she has not done so. The tax liens remain unresolved. Applicant \nstated she would arrange a payment agreement to satisfy the liens if she received a \nsecurity clearance.  (Tr. 41-45.)      \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.g. that Applicant owed a $1,036 debt, in collection status, \nand, as of June 3, 2009, the debt had not been satisfied. Applicant has not paid the \ndebt. (Tr. 45-47.) \n \n \nThe SOR also alleged at \u00b6 1.h. that Applicant owed a $1,937 debt on an account \nthat had been placed for collection and had not been paid as of June 3, 2009. Applicant \nidentified the debt as an unpaid cell phone account. The debt has not been paid. (Tr. \n47.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.k. that Applicant owed a creditor a debt of $4,174, in \ncollection status, which had not been paid as of June 3, 2009. The debt was incurred \nwhen Applicant had Lasik eye surgery on both eyes in August 2007. Applicant has \nmade no payments to the creditor to satisfy the debt. She claimed that the debt alleged \nat SOR \u00b6 1.m. was the same debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.k. However, Applicant\u2019s credit \nbureau report of October 14, 2009, showed two separate account numbers for the debts \nalleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k. and 1.m. The creditor offered to settle the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 \n1.k. for approximately $1,000, but Applicant declined the settlement because she lacked \nthe necessary funds. (Ex. 3 at 2; Tr. 50-52.) \n \n \n   Applicant purchased an automobile on credit.  She fell behind in her payments \nand owed the creditor $691 on a debt of $5,707. This debt is alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.l. In \nMay 2009, Applicant voluntarily surrendered the vehicle to the creditor. Applicant\u2019s \ncredit report of October 14, 2009, reported that Applicant owed the creditor a deficiency \nbalance of $3,755 on the repossessed automobile. Applicant has made no payments on \nthe debt. (Ex. 3 at 2; Tr. 52-54.) \n \n \nApplicant owes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) approximately $10,400 in \nunpaid federal taxes, interest, and penalties for tax years 2002, 2004, and 2006. The \nSOR alleged at \u00b6 1.n. that Applicant\u2019s wages were being garnished to satisfy the debt. \nApplicant provided documentation to establish that she had entered into a voluntary \npayroll deduction agreement with the IRS. The agreement specifies that $225 will be \ndeducted from Applicant\u2019s pay each month to satisfy the debt. Applicant intends to \nmake the voluntary payments until her federal income tax delinquency is satisfied. (Ex. \nA; Ex. B; Tr. 54-56.)  \n   \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant has consulted with a bankruptcy attorney and two credit counseling \nfirms about her delinquent debts. She has not yet made a decision about how to \nmanage and resolve her delinquencies. (Tr. 62-63.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly salary is $3,160. She and her son share an apartment \nwith her mother. Applicant and her mother divide the monthly apartment rent of $1,650. \nApplicant pays $825 each month, and so does her mother. Applicant helps her mother \nby paying $250 each month toward the mother\u2019s car expenses. Applicant reported the \nfollowing additional monthly fixed expenses: food: $350; clothing: $200; life insurance \nfor herself and her son: $50; school tuition for her son: $546; and utilities, including cell \nphone: $400. She estimated that she also had about $75 to $175 a month in \nmiscellaneous expenses, for a total of approximately $2,700 to $2,800 in total monthly \nexpenses. She estimated that her net monthly remainder was approximately $200. She \nhas about $600 in her 401(k) account and about $200 in savings accounts. She has no \ncredit cards. (Ex. 2 at 7; Tr. 64-72.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother testified as a witness on her behalf. Applicant\u2019s mother stated \nthat she purchased all the food for the household that she shares with her daughter. \nShe estimated that the food expenses were approximately $100 a week. She also \nstated that she and her daughter split the monthly utility, telephone, and cable bills, and \neach paid half. (Tr. 89-93.)     \n \n \n \n                                                             Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \n\n \n6 \n \n \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n7 \n \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns. Under AG & \n19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly \nunder AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security \nconcerns.  \n \nApplicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unable to pay her \ncreditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. If the \nfinancially delinquent behavior \u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(a) might \napply.  If \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(b) might apply.  If \u201cthe person has received or \nis receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(c) might apply.  If \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(d) might apply.  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and \nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence \nof actions to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply. \n \nThe record shows that Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies began several years \nago and continue to this day. Applicant\u2019s current financial delinquencies involve \nsubstantial sums of money in proportion to her income and resources, occurred under \ncircumstances that are likely to recur, and cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nApplicant was divorced in 2006. She incurred significant legal expenses at the \ntime of her divorce. Because of a work-related injury, her ex-husband has been unable \nto pay his share of their son\u2019s private school tuition. Applicant therefore pays \napproximately $550 a month in private school tuition for her son. However, Applicant \nand her son share an apartment with her mother. Applicant\u2019s mother pays half of the \nmonthly rent on the apartment and half of the utility expenses each month. She also \npays for all of the food consumed by Applicant and her son, an expense that Applicant \nand her mother estimate to be $400 a month. The record does not include facts that \nsuggest protracted conditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control that would explain her failure \nover a period of years to meet her financial obligations. She has been steadily \nemployed with her current employer since 1996.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nTo her credit, Applicant entered into a voluntary payroll deduction agreement with \nthe IRS, and she has authorized a deduction of $225 each month to satisfy \napproximately $10,000 in delinquent federal taxes, interest, and penalties. She has \nbegun the process of financial counseling. However, Applicant is also responsible for at \nleast ten other debts that remain unresolved. She remains dependent upon her mother \nfor financial support, and she does not have a plan in place for avoid financial \noverextension in the future. While Applicant\u2019s intention to satisfy some of her creditors in \nthe future is laudable, it is too soon to conclude that she has demonstrated a track \nrecord of financial responsibility. She has not yet demonstrated that she will repay her \ncreditors and avoid future financial delinquencies. While her divorce was a condition \nthat created financial difficulties that may have been beyond her control, she failed to   \npay debts that arose well before her marriage ended, and she did act responsibly under \nthe circumstances. I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c), and 20(e) do not apply to the \nfacts of Applicant\u2019s case. I also conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) apply only in part \nto the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has been steadily \nemployed in her present job since 1996. She is a reliable employee. She is attempting \nto provide her child with a good education.  \n \nApplicant has experienced financial difficulties since at least 2001, and she has \nsought bankruptcy protection three times. Most of the debts alleged in the SOR remain \nunpaid and unresolved. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began when she was a mature \nadult, and she failed to address her delinquent debts for a significant period, a decision \nthat raises concerns about her judgment and reliability. To her credit, she began \n\n \n9 \n \n \nvoluntarily to repay her federal income tax delinquencies through a payroll deduction. \nHowever, she has failed to satisfy other debts and continues to rely upon her mother for \nfinancial assistance. It is not clear at this time that she will accept responsibility for \nmanaging her own financial problems and satisfying her creditors.  \n \nApplicant may find it beneficial to seek professional financial counseling and legal \nadvice about resolving her debts and acquiring financial stability in the near term. She \ncan reapply for a security clearance one year after the date of this decision if her \nemployer will sponsor her. At that time, she can produce new evidence that addresses \nthe Government\u2019s current security concerns.    \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her \nfinancial delinquencies.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n           Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.h.:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i. - 1.j.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.k. - 1.m:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n.:  \n                      For Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.o -1.q.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n                                     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Goldstein, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: James Q. McDermott, Esq.\nJanuary 15, 2010\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on June 12, 2008 (Government Exhibit 1). On March 19, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe security concerns under Guideline F concerning Applicant. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 13, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non June 8, 2009.  This case was assigned to me on June 9, 2009.  DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on June 16, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on July\n28, 2009. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 8, which were\n\n2\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted\nApplicant Exhibits A through P, also without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of\nthe hearing, and the record closed, on August 5, 2009.  Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 49 and married. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks\nto retain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is\nfinancially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Applicant denied the sole allegation in the SOR. \u00b6 1.a. alleges that the\nApplicant owes a mortgage company $51,406 due to a foreclosure on his house.\nIn June 2006, Applicant and his wife decided to buy a house, after renting for\nsome time. They used 100% financing to buy the house for $258,950. They obtained a\nfirst mortgage in the amount of $206,400, and a second mortgage in the amount of\n$51,600. Both loans were from the same lender and were solely used to purchase the\nhouse. Within months of buying the home, the housing bubble burst and the house was\nworth less than what Applicant owed on it. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A; Transcript at 35-38.)\nA more serious event happened just a few months later. In the fall of 2006,\nApplicant\u2019s wife was diagnosed with a large brain tumour after falling in the shower\nduring an epileptic seizure. She underwent major brain surgery in November 2007, and\nwas hospitalized for several days at a hospital 80 miles from their home. Applicant\ndrove to see his wife every day that she was hospitalized. \nAfter returning home, Applicant\u2019s wife suffered from a severe infection that\nrequired her to be hospitalized again for a period of three weeks. Applicant again drove\n160 miles round trip every day to visit his wife when she was in the hospital. For six\nweeks after her release, she stayed with her parents so that she could receive\ncontinued care. This required a 180 mile round trip three to four times a week for\nApplicant. All of this was a financial strain to him. (Applicant Exhibit B; Transcript at 38-\n42.)\nApplicant\u2019s wife has never fully returned to normal after her surgery. She is now\non permanent disability, after a one day attempt to return to the work force in 2007.\n(Applicant Exhibit K; Transcript at 43-44.)\nWith his wife unable to work, it became clear to Applicant by June of 2007, that\nhe would not be able to keep the house. At that time, he informed his employer\u2019s\nsecurity department of this fact. (Applicant Exhibit P; Transcript at 44-46.)\n\n\u00a7508(b), State Civil Code.\n1\n3\nIn order not to have a foreclosure on his record, Applicant attempted to arrange a\nshort sale. Even though he obtained a buyer, Applicant\u2019s mortgage company refused to\naccept a short sale and foreclosed on the property in April 2008. The amount the\nmortgage company received at the foreclosure sale was $143,000. This was more than\n$100,000 less than the purchase price just 22 months before. (Applicant Exhibit D.)\nThe mortgage company first reported to the credit bureaus that Applicant\u2019s\nsecond mortgage was a charge off in the amount of $51,406. (Government Exhibits 5,\n6, and 7; Applicant Exhibit C; Transcript at 46-47.) This was incorrect. Since both of\nApplicant\u2019s mortgages were purchase money loans, they were \u201cwithout recourse\u201d under\napplicable state law.  In other words, after the foreclosure sale Applicant has no\n1\npersonal liability for the loan. \nThe mortgage company confirmed the fact that Applicant had no further personal\nliability in a later communication after he disputed the charge off. In a letter dated April\n3, 2009, they state, \u201cA correction has been sent to the credit bureaus updating to report\nthe loan as a charge off with a zero balance.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit L at 2; Transcript at 47.)\nGovernment Exhibit 8, a credit report dated July 28, 2009, confirms that this was done\nand this loan now shows as a paid charge off with a zero balance.\nSince the foreclosure and his wife\u2019s illness, Applicant has downsized his life.\nThey now live in a $65,000 mobile home, own both of their cars outright, and are current\non all of their normal monthly debts. (Transcript at 48-50, 69-70.) Applicant states, \u201cI\u2019m\nnot going to ever buy anything again that I can\u2019t afford on my salary, and we just are\nmaking sure that we are never going to make any of these mistakes that we\u2019ve learned\nin the last year, two years, will never happen again.\u201d (Transcript at 69.)\nMitigation\nApplicant has worked for his employer for 30 years, rising up from the mailroom.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit O.) He submitted a letter from his supervisor, who has known\nApplicant for over 23 years. In the 15 years that Applicant has worked on the team, the\nsupervisor finds that Applicant is \u201ca dedicated, meticulous employee,\u201d and one who\n\u201crealizes and takes seriously potential security threats and can be trusted to\nconscientiously safeguard information.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit M.)\nApplicant also submitted a letter from the Director of Security at his employer.\nThis person has known Applicant for over 15 years and has knowledge of the\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems. He states, \u201cI speak for my whole department when I say\nthat [Applicant] has never given us cause to question his honesty or integrity.\u201d\n(Applicant Exhibit N.)\n\n4\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision. In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\n\n5\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant, by his own admission, had his house foreclosed on, with\nthe result that a $51,406 second mortgage was wiped out. The evidence is sufficient to\nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose because of the burst in the housing bubble in 2006, as well as\nhis wife\u2019s serious, life-threatening, illness. The evidence is clear that the Applicant has\nlearned from this situation, down-sized his life, and will not get himself in such a\nfinancial condition again. This mitigating condition applies.\nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances.\u201d  As stated above, the serious illness of the Applicant\u2019s wife\nhad a direct influence on his inability to keep his house. He attempted a short sale of his\nhouse, and kept his employer fully informed of his financial situation. This mitigating\ncondition also applies to this case.\nApplicant does not owe any money on his second mortgage. The foreclosure\nsale wiped out the debt legally. The mortgage company acknowledges this. Accordingly,\nAG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable under the particular facts of this case.  \n\n6\nAs fully stated above, Applicant has been forced by his wife\u2019s illness and their\nfinancial condition to change their lives in profound ways. He credibly testified that he\nunderstands how they got into this financial situation, and that he will not get into it\nagain. Under the particular circumstances of this case, I find that \u201cthere are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6\n20(c).\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant, like many other\npeople, wound up with his house being worth less than he owed on it. That fact,\ncombined with his wife\u2019s serious illness, made it impossible for him to retain his house.\nHis spending was not irresponsible, nor were any of his subsequent actions to resolve\nthe debt (AG \u00b6 2(a)(2)). Based on the state of the record, I find that there have been\npermanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). Accordingly, at the present time, I\nfind that there is no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6\n2(a)(8); and that there is no likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nsituation at this time.\nOn balance, I conclude that Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports granting his request for a security clearance.\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Klimaski, Esquire\n \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on January 28, 2009. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline H based on Applicant\u2019s drug involvement.\nJune 11, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR was received on March 3, 2009, and he\nrequested a hearing. The hearing took place as scheduled on May 7, 2009. The\ntranscript (Tr.) was received on May 22, 2009. For the reasons discussed below, this\ncase is decided for Applicant.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Based on the record\nevidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 25-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked as a\ncomputer engineer since July 2008. His duties consist of writing software for his\ncustomer, a federal research laboratory. He has not married and has no children. He is\nseeking to obtain an industrial security clearance for the first time.  \nHe graduated from high school in 2002. He then relocated to another state and\nenrolled at a local community college. In December 2005, he earned an associate in\narts degree. In 2006, he enrolled in a nearby state university, and he earned a B.S. in\ncomputer science in April 2008. He then moved to the state of his current residence, he\nreceived an offer of employment in June 2008, and he started work the following month.\nHe learned of the company\u2019s drug-free workforce policy when he received the job offer,\nand he was required to undergo drug testing as a condition of employment (Exhibit A).\nApplicant admits a history of drug involvement from about July 2000 to April\n2008, all of which occurred when he was a student and before his employment in the\ndefense industry. The record evidence establishes the following:\n\u2022\nHe used marijuana about 10 to 15 times between July 2000 to August 2007;\n\u2022\nHe used cocaine about four times between May 2004 and April 2008; and\n\u2022\nHe misused a narcotic pain medicine one or two times during 2002\u20132003.  \nApplicant used these substances in social settings (parties), and he never purchased\nthe substances as they were provided to him by others. His possession of these\nsubstances was incidental to his use. \nHe disclosed, in detail, his drug involvement when he completed a security-\nclearance application in July 2008 (Exhibit 1\u2013response to Question 24a). He also\nprovided the following additional comments about his drug involvement:\nThere were 1-2 instances of using narcotic pain killers while I was in\ncollege, although I do not remember the dates nor the substance used. My\nuse of marijuana was never continuous; it was only a random social\nactivity among friends. I used cocaine three times between 2004 and 2005\nand then decided to put it behind me. On my birthday in 2008, I had a\nmajor lapse in judgment by deciding to partake in the use of cocaine. The\namount of times I used these drugs were relatively few, as this type of\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n2\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n3\nbehavior is uncharacteristic of me. Being in a college atmosphere,\nexperimenting with drugs seemed trivial, but looking back I recognize the\nseriousness and highly regret ever doing so (Exhibit 1 at 30).  \nIn addition to the security-clearance application, he confirmed and provided\ninformation about his drug involvement in his background interview of August 2008 and\nin response to interrogatories in November 2008 (Exhibits 2 and 3). In both, he\nexpressed an intention not to abuse drugs in the future.  \nIn his hearing testimony, Applicant repeated his intention, as he is now a young\nprofessional who is focused on building his career in computer science, he has no\ndesire to abuse drugs, and it is not something he wants in his life (Tr. 78\u201379). He\nspends his free time indulging in several hobbies, such as reading, cooking, bicycling,\nand jogging. In addition, Applicant signed an affidavit in which he declared an intent to\navoid abusing drugs and he understands any violation of his pledge is grounds for the\nrevocation of any clearance granted to him (Exhibit B). \nApplicant called two witnesses, both long-time employees at the federal research\nlaboratory, who vouched for his good character and trustworthiness. The first witness\nwas Applicant\u2019s older brother who is a research scientist at the lab. Applicant lived with\nthe brother for several months during 2008\u20132009 and now lives nearby in the same\napartment complex. The brother has observed that Applicant has shed his college\nattitude and is now focused on the professional workplace (Tr. 29). Both Applicant and\nhis brother were exposed to marijuana while attending a poker game, and both removed\nthemselves from the situation (Tr. 39). The brother believes that Applicant understands\nthat drug abuse is incompatible with holding a security clearance, and he has observed\nthat Applicant has expressed a good deal of regret during the past year (Tr. 43\u201344). \nThe second witness works as the head or chief of the information technology\nsection of the lab and has supervisory responsibility over Applicant. He opined that\nApplicant has done a \u201cterrific job\u201d and has exceeded his expectations (Tr. 49). He also\nbelieves that Applicant has been very responsible and trustworthy, and he has had no\nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s honesty or truthfulness (Tr. 49\u201350). Overall, the supervisor\nhas been quite pleased with Applicant\u2019s work and supports his application for a security\nclearance. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.2\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n3\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n6\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n10\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n11\n4\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n3\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes\n4\nany existing security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n5\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n6\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n7\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n8\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n9\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.10\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.11\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n12\n Revised Guidelines at 17\u201318 (setting forth the security concern as well as the disqualifying and mitigating\n13\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n14\n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n15\n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n16\n Revised Guidelines at 18. \n17\n5\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n12\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\n1.\nThe Drug Involvement Security Concern\nUnder Guideline H for drug involvement,  the security concern is that \u201cuse of an\n13\nillegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d  The definition of drug abuse is \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal\n14\ndrug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d15\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following conditions raise a\nsecurity concern: Any drug abuse (see above definition).  I considered the other DC\n16\nunder the guideline, but none apply based on the facts and circumstances of this case. \nApplicant\u2019s history of drug abuse raises security concerns because it calls into\nquestion his judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to obey the law. His\nmarijuana use (10 to 15 times) began in high school and spanned a period of years until\nhe ceased in 2007. Most of his cocaine use took place during 2004\u20132005 except for his\nmost recent drug abuse in April 2008. His misuse of pain killers took place several years\nago in 2002\u20132003. Overall, these facts and circumstances show that Applicant was an\nirregular or periodic drug abuser.    \nThe four MC under Guideline H have been considered and one of the four\napplies in Applicant\u2019s favor. The evidence in mitigation establishes a demonstrated\nintent not to abuse drugs in the future based on three main reasons.  First, he no\n17\nlonger socializes with the people he abused drugs with when he was a college student.\nHe graduated from college, relocated to another state, and started the next phase of his\nlife as a young professional who is seeking to excel in his chosen field. Second, his\nmisuse of pain killers took place several years ago and is dated, his abuse of marijuana\n\n Revised Guidelines at 1\u20132. \n18\n6\nended in 2007, and his last abuse of cocaine took place in April 2008, before he\naccepted the offer of employment and before he completed the security-clearance\napplication. These circumstances demonstrate a period of abstinence of about 13\nmonths. Third, he also demonstrated his intent via his affidavit wherein he agreed to the\nrevocation of clearance for any violation (Exhibit B). Taken together, these three\nreasons or circumstances amount to substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s intent not to\nabuse any drugs in the future. \n2.\nThe Whole-Person Concept \nUnder the Directive, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant facts and circumstances. This analysis includes nine\nadjudicative factors:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n18\nI considered all nine factors as well as the favorable testimony from Applicant\u2019s\nwitnesses. For the first factor, I considered the circumstance that Applicant\u2019s drug abuse\nwent beyond the youthful use of marijuana and extended to cocaine, which is a far more\nserious drug. In this regard, I considered the reports from the National Institute on Drug\nAbuse on drug abuse and addiction, cocaine, marijuana, and prescription medications\n(Exhibits 4, 5, 6, and 7). For the second factor, I considered the circumstance that\nApplicant\u2019s drug abuse occurred when he was a high-school or college student and that\nis no longer the case. He is now a young adult with far more responsibilities. For the\nthird factor, I considered the irregular or periodic nature of Applicant\u2019s drug abuse as\nwell as his abuse of cocaine about 13 months ago. For the fourth factor, I considered\nApplicant\u2019s age and maturity and conclude that he was young-and-dumb when he\nengaged in drug abuse. Certainly, Applicant is not the first (nor will he be the last)\nperson to engage in foolish misbehavior while in college and subsequently regret it.\n  \nIn addition, I considered the circumstance that Applicant disclosed his drug\nabuse when he completed his security-clearance application, during his background\ninterview, and in response to interrogatories. He deserves credit for reporting adverse\ninformation, and it comes into play for the eighth and ninth factors. His disclosure\nreduces the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. Likewise, his\n\n See ISCR Case No. 07-13082 (Jun. 27, 2008) (deciding case against a 24-year-old software engineer who\n19\nused marijuana about 200 times over a period of years, including using it in violation of his company\u2019s drug-\nfree workforce policy). \n7\ndisclosure, when combined with the other favorable evidence, reduces the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence of drug abuse.\nThis case presents both unfavorable and favorable evidence, which requires\nthoughtful balancing in light of the clearly-consistent standard. I have considered the\ntotality of facts and circumstances and conclude that the favorable evidence is\npersuasive. I am persuaded that Applicant\u2019s drug abuse is a thing of the past and he will\nnot abuse drugs in the future. It is likely that I would have reached the opposite\nconclusion, however, had Applicant\u2019s drug abuse been more frequent or if he had\nengaged in drug abuse in violation of his company\u2019s drug-free workplace policy or after\nsubmitting his security-clearance application.  Applicant would be well advised to bear\n19\nthis in mind. \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the drug involvement security concerns, and Applicant met his ultimate\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for\nApplicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:\n \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.  \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant\u2019s credit union account (Ex. E) shows a $3,000 \npayment having been made on March 9, 2009. The collection agency\u2019s letter states the \noriginal creditor was the bank listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($8,136). The collection agency is also \ncollecting the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.g ($1,261), which originated with Sears. Applicant \nasserts this debt was paid to another creditor and he was waiting for a receipt. (Ex. A) \n \n \nApplicant owes the creditor listed in SOR \u00b6 1. h ($1,382). He asserts, now that \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1c has been paid, he has begun a payment plan for the $1,382 debt. \nNo documentation supporting his assertion was provided. Applicant asserts, but fails to \nprovide documtation, that the $161 medical debt listed SOR \u00b6 1.b. has been paid. He \nstates he is waiting for the receipt showing payment. (Ex. A)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s August 2008 CBR (Items 5) indicates Applicant is paying as agreed \non his six student loans. Applicant owed $2,700 on the loans, which orginially totaled \nmore than $12,000.  \n \n \nA summary of the SOR debts follows: \n \n \nCreditor \nAmount Current Status \n1.a Medical debt. \n$158 \nPaid.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \n \n4\n\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. The SOR listed eight debts which had been placed for collection or charged \noff, which totaled approximately $39,000. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability \n \n \n \n5\n\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), Applicant=s financial problems were contributed to by his \ndivorce and his ex-wife failing to pay her child support obligation for their two daughters. \nAdditionally, he was laid off from work and when he again found work it was at a \nsubstantially lower income. He has been with his current employer since January 2003. \nHe has paid four of the debts and an additional debt was transferred to one of the \ncollection agencies that was paid. These five debts total approximately $36,000. AG \u00b6 \n20(c), clear indication the problem is being resolved, and AG \u00b6 20(d), good faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors, applies. \n \nApplicant asserts, but provided no documentation, he has a repayment plan \npaying SOR \u00b6 1.h ($1,382) and has paid two additional debts, SOR \u00b6 1.b ($161) and \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($1,251), for which he is awaiting receipts. Normally undocumented asserts \nhave little probative value. However, Applicant has paid $36,000 of his debt and the \nremaining three debts, which he asserts have been paid or he is making payment, totals \nless than $3,000.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s CBR indicates his six student loans are being paid \u201cas agreed.\u201d He \nhas reduced the balance on these student loans from more than $12,000 to less than \n \n \n \n6\n\n$3,000. Paying one set of obligations often provides insight as to the likelihood an \napplicant will pay other debt. Having paid his student loan obligation as agreed and \naddressed $44,000 of debt, not all of which was listed as being of concern in the SOR. I \nbelieve Applicant when he says he has paid two additional debts and is waiting for a \nreceipt and has started a payment plan on the final debt.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The debts incurred after Applicant \nwas laid off and took a job at substantially less income before securing his current job. \nSince getting his current job he has paid his past due obligations.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, financial considerations: \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.g: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n7\n\n \n \n \n8\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 25, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On January 8, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.1 The SOR alleges security \n \n1On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \nMay 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nconcerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement), E (Personal Conduct), and J \n(Criminal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn March 5, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the \nfile of relevant material (FORM), dated March 26, 2009, was provided to him, and he \nwas afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.2 Applicant did submit information within the 30-day time \nperiod after receiving a copy of the FORM. The case was assigned to an administrative \njudge on May 5, 2009, and was reassigned to me on May 11, 2009 due to caseload \nconsiderations. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied or partially denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 2.a., 2.b., 3.d., admitted SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 3.a., 3.b, and neither admitted or denied SOR \u00b6 3.c. His admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old self-employed contractor for a defense contractor. He \nwas awarded a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in May 2001. Applicant has never married and has \nno dependents.3 \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation included a review of his February 2008 e-\nQIP, his March 2008 FBI Record Report, his November 2008 Response to \nInterrogatories, and his March 2009 Response to SOR.4 \n \nDrug Involvement/Personal Conduct/Criminal Conduct \n \nThe Government established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and/or evidence \npresented that from about 1989 to about 2005 he used marijuana on average \napproximately three to four times per month. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) \n \n \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n2 DOHA transmittal letter is dated March 26, 2009; and Applicant received the FORM on April 28, \n2009. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after his receipt to file \nobjections, or to supply additional information. Applicant timely submitted a letter dated April 23, 2009, \nwhich was within the 30-day time period after receipt of FORM. \n3 Applicant\u2019s background information was derived from his e-QIP, Item 5, unless otherwise stated. \n \n4 Items 5, 7, 6, and 4, respectively. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nApplicant admits he used marijuana during the time period alleged from about \n1989 to about 2005. He denies, however, using marijuana on average three to four \ntimes per month during that time period. Applicant says in his Response to SOR that he \nused marijuana once in 1989, approximately three times in 1996, and \u201con occasion\u201d \napproximately three to four times per month in the months he used marijuana during the \ntime period 2000 to approximately December 2004.5 This version is markedly different \nthan what Applicant disclosed when he was interviewed by an Office of Personnel \n(OPM) investigator in July 2008, when he said he \u201csmoked marijuana about three times \nper month from 1989/1990 to 1995\u201d and \u201cfrom 1996 \u2013 2005\u201d his use of marijuana \n\u201cincreased to about once per week.\u201d6 Applicant also admitted to the investigator that \nwhen he completed his e-QIP, he \u201cminimized the number of times he used marijuana \nand the time frame he used marijuana for fear that he would look like a habitual drug \nuser.\u201d7 \n \nThe information Applicant provided in his Response to SOR is also markedly \ndifferent than the information he provided when responding to Interrogatories \nConcerning Drugs in November 2008, in which he said \u201cprior to Jan. 2006, before I \nstarted truck driving school, I smoked aprox (sic) once per week with friends socially.\u201d8 \nThis statement more closely aligns or parallels with another statement Applicant made \nearlier to the OPM investigator, when he told the investigator he enrolled in truck \ndriver\u2019s school in January 2006 and \u201cdecided that as a truck driver, he shouldn\u2019t use \nmarijuana.\u201d9 Applicant in his Response to SOR appears to minimize his extended \nhistory and frequency of illegal drug use. I find his earlier disclosures to an OPM \ninvestigator establishing a more accurate and clearer picture of that use and to be more \ncredible because they result from an in-person interview by an investigator. Moreover, \nthey are in closer temporal proximity to the drug use. \n \nThe Government established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and/or evidence \npresented that he falsified material facts on his February 2008 e-QIP, in response to \nSection 23 of his e-QIP inquiring whether he had ever been charged with or convicted of \nany felony offense; and Section 24 of his e-QIP inquiring since the age of 16 or in the \nlast 7 years, whichever is shorter, had he illegally used any controlled substance.  (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.) \n \nApplicant admitted he was charged in 1995 with the offense of Criminal Sexual \nConduct III.

Spent 3 days in jail, placed on 6 months\u2019 probation, paid $250.00 \nfine.\u201d11 \n \nIn his Response to SOR, Applicant says he \u201cmade the mistake of thinking that \nthe honest answer to the question was the conviction of Gross Indecency \u2013 not the \noriginal charge\u201d and \u201ctotally made a mistake if I stated that I only spent 3 days in jail and \nwas placed on 6 months probation, paid $250.00 fine.\u201d \n \nApplicant also has provided differing factual accounts of his illegal drug use \nhistory. Notably, Applicant\u2019s admission to the OPM investigator that he deliberately \n\u201cminimized\u201d information he provided in his e-QIP in responding to questions regarding \nhis illegal drug use and drug activity, out of \u201cfear he would look like a habitual drug user\u201d \nhad he honestly disclosed accurate information.12 Applicant provided a more accurate \naccount of his illegal drug use during his OPM interview and in his Response to \nInterrogatories Concerning Drugs.13 Record evidence clearly establishes that Applicant \nused illegal drugs much more frequently than the \u201c15-20 times total\u201d he disclosed in his \ne-QIP, and as he admitted to the OPM investigator, provided that false information in a \ndeliberate attempt to \u201cminimize\u201d the true frequency and extent of his illegal drug use.14 \n \nDespite Applicant\u2019s denials in his Response to SOR, there is sufficient record \nevidence to support findings that he deliberately falsified his responses to his e-QIP as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b. \n \nThe Government established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and/or evidence \npresented that in May 1995, he was charged with Criminal Sexual Conduct III, a felony, \nand Gross Indecency. In November 1995, he pled guilty to the charge of Gross \nIndecency, and served about nine months in jail, followed by about two and a half years \non probation, and paid fines and fees of approximately $4,500.00. (SOR \u00b6 3.a.) Further \nestablished is that in about 1998, Applicant was cited for possession of marijuana, and \nattended a drug treatment program as part of an agreement to have the citation \nremoved from his criminal record.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d15 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).16 \n \n15 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something \nless than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the \nevidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. \nFederal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but \nless than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n16 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline H, the Government\u2019s concern is: \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG \u00b6 24. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides two potentially Disqualifying Conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of paraphernalia. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admitted drug abuse and possession over an extended period of \ntime, evidenced by his own disclosures and especially his OPM interview warrant \napplication of these two Disqualifying Conditions. \n \nAG \u00b6 26  provides four potential Mitigating Conditions under this concern: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for \nany violation; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admitted illegal drug use occurred over multiple years and at least as \nrecently as 2005. Although there is record evidence to support possible application of \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and (b), Applicant has not produced sufficient evidence to warrant their \napplication in this case. In considering the possible application of these Mitigating \nConditions, it is fair and reasonable to consider that there is record evidence to support \na conclusion that Applicant\u2019s admitted illegal drug use was substantial and occurred well \ninto his adult years, and such use cannot be fairly or accurately attributed to youthful \nindiscretion. After considering all available evidence, I am unable to apply any of the \nMitigating Conditions under this concern. \nPersonal Conduct \n \nUnder Guideline E, the Government\u2019s concern is: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two Disqualifying Conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and, \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. 17 \n \nBecause Applicant\u2019s e-QIP response contains very specific and admittedly false \ninformation that minimizes to a significant extent the true and serious nature of \nhis actual charges and punishment, Applicant\u2019s explanation that he simply made \na \u201cmistake\u201d in his e-QIP response lacks credibility. Despite his denials in his \nResponse to SOR, the evidence supports findings that he deliberately falsified \nhis e-QIP answers. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) both apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven Mitigating Conditions under this concern: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n17The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)).  \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations.  \n \nAdditionally, there is credible evidence to support a conclusion that Applicant has \nagain, and recently, attempted to minimize his history of illegal drug use in his \nResponse to SOR. This conclusion is further evidenced by Applicant\u2019s statement in his \nResponse to SOR regarding his 1998 citation for marijuana possession: \u201cPlease note \nthat I had not been using, there were three other people in my car (a few had been \nusing). I was the driver of the car so the legal responsibility was mine.\u201d18 \n \nThis statement conflicts with Applicant\u2019s earlier account of the citation that he \nmade to the OPM investigator: \nSubject stated that the only incident he had with any authorities regarding \nmarijuana was in approximately 1998 when he was driving with a couple \nof friends in [location]. One of the friends had a marijuana cigarette and \nthey were passing the marijuana cigarette around while they were driving. \nWhile subject was taking a puff from the cigarette, a [name]. County \nControl Officer pulled up beside Subject and observed him. Subject was \nstopped and issued a citation for the drug use.19 \nNone of the Mitigating Conditions fully apply. Applicant deliberately falsified \ninformation in his e-QIP, raising significant concerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to comply with rules and regulations. It is clear \nfrom Applicant\u2019s Response to SOR that he still attempts to minimize or change facts, \nincluding facts he previously admitted or provided, and that he does not accept full \nresponsibility for his conduct. \n \n \n \n \n18 Item 4. \n \n19 Item 6 at 6. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nCriminal Conduct \n \nUnder Guideline J, the Government\u2019s concern is: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two potentially Disqualifying Conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct includes his 1995 Criminal Sexual Conduct III and Gross \nIndecency charges, his 1998 marijuana citation, his marijuana usage from 1989 to \n2005, and his 2008 e-QIP falsification warranting application of AGs \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c). \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four potential Mitigating Conditions: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nBased on record evidence, and for the reasons discussed supra, I am unable to apply \nany of the Mitigating Conditions under this guideline. \n \nLastly, it is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, \nfictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation or knowingly make or use a false \nwriting in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of \nthe United States. 18 U.S.C. ' 1001. Security clearances are within the jurisdiction of \nthe executive branch of the Government of the United States. See Egan, 484 U.S. at \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n527. Applicant deliberately provided false information on his February 2008 e-QIP, \nwhich is a serious felony and recent, as discussed supra.20 \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nThe Government must be able to repose a high degree of trust in those to whom \nit grants access to sensitive information.21 Applicant\u2019s drug involvement, criminal \nconduct, and falsification creates doubts about his eligibility for a security clearance. \nAbsent significant evidence of mitigation or extenuation, those doubts must be resolved \nagainst the Applicant.22  \n \nThe comments in the Analysis section of this decision are incorporated in the \nWhole Person Concept. Record evidence establishes that Applicant\u2019s unlawful conduct \ncommenced in 1989 with drug use and continued until he falsified his e-QIP in 2008. He \npresented little or no mitigating evidence. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \n \n20Deliberate and materially false answers on a security clearance application may violate 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1001. The Supreme Court defined \u201cmateriality\u201d in United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 512 \n(1995): as a statement having a \u201cnatural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing, the decision \nmaking body to which it is addressed.\u201d See also United States v. McLaughlin, 386 F.3d 547, 553 (3d Cir. \n2004). If Applicant had provided accurate answers on his security clearance applications, his accurate \nanswers are capable of influencing the government to deny his security clearance. His criminal offenses \nare sufficiently serious to potentially jeopardize approval of his security clearance. Making a false \nstatement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious crime, a felony (the maximum potential sentence includes \nconfinement for five years and a $10,000 fine). In light of my ultimate decision, and the absence to \nalleged a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 in the SOR, it is unnecessary for me to decide whether or not \nApplicant actually violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. \n \n21 Snepp v.

Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 8, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On July 24, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason\n\nREDACTED.  \n1\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s\nfactual findings were supported by substantial record evidence; whether the Judge\u2019s application of\nthe pertinent mitigating conditions was erroneous; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis\nwas erroneous.  Finding error, we reverse.\nThe Judge found as follows: Applicant is a 53 year-old engineer working for a federal\ncontractor.  He became a U.S. citizen in the early 1990s.  Applicant\u2019s parents live in Nigeria, where\nthey are retired.  Applicant\u2019s brother (A) is a high-level official in the Nigerian government.   He has\n1\nanother brother and a sister who are employed by a state government in Nigeria.  Applicant speaks\nwith these siblings every two weeks by telephone.\nNigeria is a nation with a poor human rights record.  It has experienced periodic armed\nconflicts among religious, political and ethnic factions.  The current president is working to restore\npeace and security to Nigeria.  The previous U.S. administration considered Nigeria an important\npartner in the war on terror.\nDepartment Counsel has challenged the Judge\u2019s findings concerning Applicant\u2019s brother A.\nSpecifically, he contends that the Judge\u2019s finding that A exercises no policy-making authority is\nwithout foundation in the record.\nThe Appeal Board  reviews the Judge\u2019s findings of facts to determine if they are supported\nby substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620\n(1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we defer to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nIn the Findings section of the decision, the Judge quoted Applicant\u2019s testimony to the effect\nthat A works in a strictly technical position.  Although the findings do not mention policy per se, the\nimplication of the quoted testimony is that A is not involved in formulating policy for the Nigerian\ngovernment.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument that this finding does not take into account contrary\nrecord evidence is persuasive.  In addition to the portion quoted by the Judge, Applicant testified\nelsewhere concerning his brother.  He described A as being similar to a  \u201cCEO,\u201d that he travels\nfrequently to the U.S., and is involved in \u201cthe policy of organizations\u201d that are addressing matters\n\nof national importance. Although the record does not go into great detail as to the nature of A\u2019s\nwork, it is reasonable to believe that a government official such as A would exercise responsibility\nat the policy-making level.  Applicant did not provide anything to corroborate his statement to the\nJudge that A\u2019s position is a purely technical one.  Applicant did not provide information about the\norganization with which A is affiliated, though it is likely that such information would have been\nreadily available.  The decision does not analyze Applicant\u2019s testimony or attempt to explain why\nthe Judge found the quoted portion of Applicant\u2019s testimony to be a definitive statement of the nature\nA\u2019s duties.  Neither does it address Applicant\u2019s own use of the word \u201cpolicy\u201d in describing A\u2019s\nactivities.  Therefore, to the extent that the Judge\u2019s use of the quoted portion of Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony reasonably implies a finding that A is involved in purely technical matters, this finding\nis unsupported by the record evidence viewed as a whole.\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s contacts in Nigeria raised Guideline B security\nconcerns.  However, he further concluded that Applicant had demonstrated mitigation under Foreign\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.8(b).\n2\nInfluence Mitigating Condition (FIMC) 8(b).   This provision mitigates security concerns when an\n2\napplicant\u2019s ties to the foreign contact are minimal or his ties to the U.S. are so deep and\nlongstanding, that he can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\nThe Judge stated that, insofar as Applicant\u2019s brother occupies a technical position in government,\none that does not involve security or financial matters, he is not likely to become a means through\nwhich Applicant could be pressured to compromise classified information.  Department Counsel\npersuasively argues that the Judge\u2019s analysis is not supported by the record evidence.\nDespite our conclusion that the Judge erred in his finding about A\u2019s responsibilities, the\nBoard is not convinced that the distinction between a technical position and a policy-making one is\nmeaningful in a security clearance context, especially under the facts of this case.  Applicant\u2019s\ncontentions in this regard appear to have been an effort to demonstrate that A is not in a position to\nhave sanctioned or have participated in human rights violations.  However, there is nothing in the\nrecord to suggest that he has engaged in such activity and the Board is not basing its decision on such\na supposition.  Rather, the security concern is rooted in A\u2019s prominence in a highly-sensitive field\nthat could draw him to the attention of parties interested in acquiring U.S. technology.  This concern\napplies regardless of whether A actually formulates policy or simply advises those who do.\nAs stated above, A has a high-level position and enjoys a reputation beyond the Nigerian\nborders.  Applicant has testified that he speaks to his brother frequently and serves as a surrogate\nuncle for A\u2019s children who live in the U. S.  Given those facts, it is foreseeable that he could become\na means through which parties within or outside of Nigeria could attempt to exert pressure on\nApplicant.  The record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that, given the possibility of such\na situation, Applicant\u2019s obligation to the U.S. would necessarily outweigh his ties to his brother or\nto his other relatives in Nigeria.  Application of the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s\npatriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways when faced\nwith choices that could be important to a loved-one, such as a family member.  \u201cAny doubt\nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2(b).  \nThe record does not support a reasonable conclusion that Applicant has met his burden of\npersuasion, either under the mitigating conditions or the whole-person factors.  The Judge\u2019s decision\ndoes not consider an important aspect of the case and offers an explanation that runs contrary to the\nweight of the record evidence.  ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).\nAccordingly, in light of the record and considering the Egan standard, the Judge\u2019s favorable decision\nis not sustainable.  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security\u2019\u201d).\n\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006. \nJuly 24, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on February 23, 2009. DOHA issued\na notice of hearing on March 20, 2009, and the hearing was held on April 8, 2009.\nAt the hearing, the government submitted four exhibits (GE 1 through 4).\nApplicant objected to GE 2 and GE 4 (Tr. 13-20), contending that there was inaccurate\ninformation about his passport in the exhibits that had been mitigated. I overruled his\nobjection, explaining that the Guideline C issues had been mitigated, and the only\nissues for hearing were those arising from Guideline B. \nApplicant testified at the hearing, and presented four exhibits (AE A through AE\nD) that were received in evidence without objection. AE E and AE F were submitted\nfollowing the hearing and have been received in evidence. The two exhibits include\nperformance evaluations, and a letter of compelling need. \nAdministrative notice was also taken of several United States Government\nagency publications that describe the government of Nigeria, its human rights record,\nand various problems U.S. citizens face in traveling to the country.

Neither his father nor\nmother knows how Applicant is employed; they do not ask about his work (Id.).\nApplicant\u2019s telephonic contact with his mother is weekly (answer to SOR; GE 2). \nApplicant\u2019s brother \u201cF,\u201d a resident citizen of Nigeria, is 50 years old (SOR 1.c.).\nHe is an engineer (GE 4). He has worked as the Director-General of the Nigerian\nAtomic Energy Commission since April 2006 (Tr. 49). The Commission is an agency of\nthe Nigerian federal government (Tr. 53). The agency is trying to build a nuclear facility\nto generate power for the country (Tr. 36). When asked whether brother F is employed\nin a high position in the Nigerian government, Applicant testified:\nNot administrative, I mean, basically it is a scientific body - - in pursuit of\nbeing able to use nuclear energy. That is involving security or any financial\ntype of decisions of the Nigerian government so he\u2019s not part of the\nfunctionaries that would be involved in human rights abuse or in financial\nmatters. It is strictly a very technical position (Tr. 49-50).\nApplicant subsequently testified that his brother is \u201cpretty well\u201d known all over the\nworld, not just in Nigeria (Id.), and noted that brother F reports to the Minister of Science\nand Technology, a cabinet level position (Tr. 51). Brother F\u2019s wife is employed as a high\nlevel, civil servant in one of the state governments of Nigeria (Id.). Applicant has\ntelephonic contact with brother F every two weeks (GE 2; Tr. 52). Brother F relies on\nApplicant to periodically check on the welfare of brother F\u2019s three children in American\ncolleges. (Tr. 36). \nApplicant\u2019s brother \u201cS\u201d is 41 years old, and employed as an accountant for one of\nthe state governments of Nigeria (Tr. 52; GE 2). The wife of brother S is a teacher in the\nschool system controlled by one of the state governments (Tr. 54). As with brother F,\nApplicant\u2019s contact with brother S is every two weeks by telephone (GE 2).\nApplicant\u2019s sister \u201cD\u201d is 60 years old. She is employed as a school administrator\nfor one of the state governments of Nigeria (GE 4). Sister D\u2019s husband is a minister (Tr.\n55). Applicant\u2019s next oldest sister \u201cL\u201d is 57 years old (Tr. 38; GE 4). Sister L\u2019s husband\nis a lawyer with his own practice (Id.). She also works as a school administrator.\nApplicant\u2019s youngest sister \u201cB\u201d is 46 years old and is employed as a catering officer for\none of the state governments (Id.). Sister B\u2019s husband is an employee at a private\ncement company (Id.). Applicant contacts his sisters by telephone every month or every\ntwo months by telephone (Tr. 39).\nApplicant has no financial interests in Nigeria (Tr. 39; GE 1), and has no\ninheritance interests in the country (Tr. 56). All his assets are located in the U.S. (Tr.\n39). He owns his own home valued at approximately $340,000, and, in addition to\n\n Applicant did not indicate the value of his stock. \n1\n4\nstocks,  his retirement account amounts to about $240,000 (Tr.41). His wife inherited a\n1\nhouse worth about $100,000, in addition to a time-share unit worth $60,000 (Tr. 42),\nboth in the U.S. Since 1996, he has been active with a charitable organization, cooking\nand feeding the needy (T. 60). His wife participates in similar community-assistance\ncauses targeting the elderly and impoverished.\nApplicant has never voted in a Nigerian election since immigrating to the U.S.,\nand has always voted in U.S. elections (Tr. 45, 59). His documentary exhibits include\nhis statement that he will renounce his Nigerian citizenship if asked by the U.S.\ngovernment (AE A). In AE C, Applicant\u2019s security manager advised that he was holding\nApplicant\u2019s passport. Applicant provided two foreign contact forms identifying the foreign\ncontact and detailing the extent of his contact with non-U.S. citizens.\nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations for 2006 through 2008 (AE E) show he is a\nhigh contributor. AE F, a one-page document, entitled \u201cLetter of Compelling Need,\u201d was\nalso admitted in evidence. The letter describes Applicant\u2019s educational background, his\nexpertise, and his foreign relatives listed in the SOR. The last paragraph of the letter\ncontains a request for waiver of the \u201cSAPCO Governing Eligibility for Access to SAP\n(special access programs).\u201d The letter, marked unclassified, is unsigned by the\n\u201cContractor Program Security Officer\u201d and the \u201cProgram Manager.\u201d I have no authority\nto entertain this request for waiver. The only authority I have (as set forth in the\ndefinitions section of DoD Directive 5220.6 at 3.2.) is to determine whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance. Even if I had the\nauthority, I would reject the request as the exhibit is unsigned by the security officer and\nthe program manager. \nAdministrative Notice\nI have taken administrative notice of facts contained in the administrative notice\ndocuments provided by the government. The administrative notice documents are:\nU.S. Department of State, Background Note: Nigeria, dated December 2008;\nU.S. Department of State, Country Specific Information, Nigeria, dated June 2,\n2008;\nU.S. Department of State, Travel Warning: Nigeria, dated December 2, 2008;\nU.S. Department of State, 2008 Human Rights Report, February 25, 2009;\n\n5\nCongressional Research Service, CRS Report for Congress, Nigeria: Current\nIssues, dated January 30, 2008 (Congressional Research Service Report); \nU.S. Diplomatic Mission to Nigeria, Warden Message, March 16, 2009.\nNigeria, since gaining its independence in 1960, has been controlled more by\nmilitary rulers than democratically elected civilian rulers. Even though the government\nreturned to civilian rule in 1999, the government continues to have a poor human rights\nrecord. The lack of law and order in various areas of the country results in internal,\nperiodic armed conflicts between religious, political and ethnic factions, and external\nconflicts with travelers to the country, particularly in the Niger Delta region. Also,\nNigerian government officials continue to engage in torture, arbitrary arrests, and\njudicial corruption. Recognizing the troubling problems in the Niger Delta region, i.e., the\nrash of abductions since January 2008, the current president, elected in May 2007, has\npledged to restore peace and security to the region, while instilling long-term, electoral\nreform throughout the country. President Bush considered Nigeria an important partner\nin the war on terror. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). The\nadjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions,\nand are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nIn reaching a decision under the Directive, the administrative judge must\nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable, in making a decision. The administrative judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative\ngoal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision that incorporates a number of\nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration in every\ndecision. AG \u00b6 2.(b) recommends that any reasonable doubt concerning personnel\nbeing considered for access to classified information should be resolved in favor of\nnational security. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are\nreasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have\navoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n6\nAnalysis\nForeign Influence\n\u00b6 6. The Concern. \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if\nthe individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target U.S.\ncitizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d\nThe two conditions that create security concerns are:\nForeign Influence (FI) disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 7.a. (contact with a\nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other\nperson who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact\ncreates \na \nheightened \nrisk \nof \nforeign \nexploitation, \ninducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion); and \nFI DC \u00b6 7.b. (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s\nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing\nthat information)\nHaving family ties in a foreign country is not automatically disqualifying under the\nforeign influence guideline. However, when an applicant has contact with his relative(s)\nin a foreign country, that contact is sufficient to raise the potential for foreign influence.\nApplicant\u2019s regular contact with his parents, two brothers, and three sisters, all resident\ncitizens of Nigeria, raises a heightened risk of foreign pressure and manipulation. Even\nthough they are not agents of a foreign power, two of his sisters are school\nadministrators in state governments of Nigeria, while the third sister is a catering officer\nfor one of the state governments. Brother S is an accountant for a state government.\nFinally, brother F is employed by the federal government as the Director-General of the\nNigerian Atomic Energy Commission. \nIn addition to the foreign influence concerns triggered by Applicant\u2019s contact with\nhis relatives, the last sentence of the FI guideline states that, \u201cAdjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether\nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with the risk of terrorism.\u201d The administrative notice\ndocuments disclose facts that law and order problems still plague parts of Nigeria,\nnotwithstanding the government\u2019s ongoing campaign for stability and security\n\n7\nthroughout the country. Although there is no evidence that the Nigerian government\ntargets U.S. citizens to obtain protected information, the government\u2019s poor record of\nhuman rights abuses, coupled with its misconduct and corruption record, impedes\nmeaningful efforts at long-term reform. \nUnder FI DC \u00b6 7.a., Applicant\u2019s contacts with his relatives in Nigeria, together\nwith the security problems that exist in the country, create a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation and pressure against Applicant. Under FI DC \u00b6 7.b., his contacts with his\nrelatives also raise the potential for conflict of interest between his security obligations\nand his desire to help his relatives. The foreign influence concerns require Applicant to\npresent evidence in mitigation to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.\nThe three conditions that could mitigate foreign influence concerns are:\nFI MC \u00b6 8.a. (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the position or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will\nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.); \nFI MC \u00b6 8.b. (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is minimal, or the individual has such deep and long-lasting\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected\nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest);\n FI MC \u00b6 8.c. (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual\nand infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for\nforeign influence or exploitation)\nApplicant receives no mitigation under FI MC \u00b6 8.a. or FI MC \u00b6 8.c. His weekly\ncontacts with his parents, and bi-weekly to monthly contacts with his siblings continue to\nraise the remote possibility that the Nigerian government or criminal factions within the\ncountry could apply pressure through his relatives to Applicant. \nHowever, based on the magnitude of Applicant\u2019s firm ties to the U.S., he receives\nsubstantial mitigation under FI MC \u00b6 8.b. Applicant\u2019s mother is retired and his father is\noperating a fishing business during his retirement. Four of his five siblings work for one\nof the state governments in Nigeria, either as accountant or as administrators. There is\nno evidence that any of the siblings or their spouses exercise any policy functions for\nthe state or federal government of Nigeria. Brother F is employed as the Deputy-\nGeneral of the country\u2019s Atomic Energy Commission. Even though employed at the\nfederal level of the Nigerian government, and reporting to the Minister of Science and\nTechnology, Applicant\u2019s brother holds a technical position with the scientific objective of\n\n8\nsupplying power for the country. He is not involved in any security or financial decisions\nof the Nigerian government. In addition, given the friendly relations between the country\nand the U.S. since transition to civilian rule in 1999, it is unlikely the Nigerian\ngovernment would want to jeopardize the relationship by exerting pressure or influence\non brother F, or any other family member, to cause Applicant to have choose between\nNigeria and the U.S. government.  \nApplicant\u2019s strong relationship with the U.S. convinces me he can be counted on\nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. government. This relationship\nstarted in 1978 when he immigrated to this country for advanced education. He married\nhis U.S.-born wife in August 1981. He successfully completed his college education in\n1982, and his master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 1986. He has been a U.S.\ncitizen since 1991. He was hired by his current U.S. employer in 1996, and has held a\nsecurity clearance since 1998, without any security violations. His substantial U.S.\nassets include a home worth about $340,000, stocks, and a retirement account of about\n$240,000. His wife owns a house worth $100,000 and a time-share unit valued at\n$60,000. He has no property or other financial interests in Nigeria.\nApplicant is fully aware of his reporting requirements when interfacing with non-\nU.S. officials. His performance between 2006 and 2008 has been exemplary.\nConsidering the evidence as a whole, I find the FI guideline for Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nMy finding for Applicant under the FI guideline must still be evaluated in the\ncontext of nine variables known as the whole person concept. In evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the administrative judge should consider the\nfollowing factors at \u00b6 2.(a) of the AG: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which the participation was\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nApplicant is 53 years old. He has been in this country since 1978. He has been\nmarried to a U.S. citizen since 1981, and has been a U.S. citizen since 1991. He has\nbeen employed by the same employer since 1996, and enjoys very good performance\nevaluations over the past two years. He has held a security clearance since 1998, with\nno security miscues. Since 1996, Applicant has been active with a national charitable\norganization, preparing and serving meals to the destitute. His wife is involved in similar\ncauses designed to provide help to those that are elderly or less fortunate. Should\nApplicant find himself in a future position of having to choose between a family member\nand U.S. interests, I believe he will select the U.S. Accordingly, I find for Applicant under\nthe FI guideline. \n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Foreign Influence, Guideline B):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On \nJune 17, 2009, I was assigned the case. On July 7, 2009, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing scheduling the hearing which was held on August 5, 2009.  \n \n \nThe government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 6, which were admitted into \nevidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through EE, \nwhich were admitted into evidence. The record was held open to allow additional \ninformation from Applicant. On August 6, 2009, additional material was submitted. \nDepartment Counsel had no objection to the material, which was admitted into the \nrecord as Ex. FF and Ex. GG.

After a thorough review of the \nrecord, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old computer support technician who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since 2002, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. His annual \nsalary is $58,549. (Ex. GG) His monthly net pay is approximately $3,000. (Tr. 58) Since \n1992, Applicant has an additional part-time job working as a security guard. He currently \nworks 21 hours a week from which his take-home pay is almost $400 per week. (Ex. \nEE) Applicant has $2,584 in his company\u2019s retirement plan. (Ex. FF) \n \n \nFrom February 1997 to April 1992, Applicant was on active duty in the U.S. Air \nForce. He retired with an honorable discharge at the grade of E-6. He received a \nmilitary retirement, but the funds go to his ex-wife. (Tr. 66) \n \n \nIn 1998, Applicant purchased a home, which was later turned into rental property. \nHe incurred debts when he had to make repairs due to mold damage. He was unable to \nrent the home until February 2009. (Tr. 45, 71) He pays $1,625 on his first and second \nmortgage and receives net income of $1,380, which leaves a $245 monthly deficit. (Tr. \n59) That monthly amount is offset by his tax saving he receives on the rental property. \n(Tr. 74)  \n \n \n \nPrior to 2008, Applicant\u2019s finances were good. In 2008, he incurred repair debts \nto his rental property, his daughter separated from her husband resulting in Applicant \n \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmaking a number of the monthly payments on her mobile home, and his sister needed \nhis assistance with her financial problems. (Tr. 65, 70)  \n  \n \n \nThe $9,111 debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a was incurred due to home repairs, car \nrepairs, and a combination of credit card purchases. (Tr. 43) The debt has been paid. \n(Ex. S) He made two payments of $1,675. (Ex. T, U, V) At the time the debt was \nincurred, Applicant\u2019s home had a fair market value of $380,000 on which he owed \napproximately $150,000. (Tr. 44) Applicant owed $1,107 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) on a charged off \naccount, which has been paid. (Tr. 46, Ex. X) Applicant paid $720 to settle the debt. \n(Ex. W)  \n \n \nApplicant is making monthly payments on the $10,572 credit card debt (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c). (Ex. N, O) In December 2008, Applicant opened a bank account so he could make \nautomatic, monthly, direct payments on his debts. He is paying $375 monthly on one \ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant has paid the $4,229 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) credit card debt. (Tr. 48, \nEx. C) Payment was made to a collection agency. (Ex. D through H) Applicant was at \none time past due on an account (SOR \u00b6 1.e, $175) with this same creditor. He makes \n$200 monthly payments on this account and the account is current. (Ex.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant owed six charged off, past due, or placed for collection accounts, \nwhich totaled in excess of $32,000. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n6 \n \n \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and, \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant has paid or is currently paying all six of the SOR debts. Even though \nApplicant=s financial problems are recent and there were six debts, AG \u00b6 20(a) partially \napplies because Applicant has sufficient funds to meet his financial obligations and his \nfinancial problems are unlikely to recur.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), Applicant did not experience loss of employment, unexpected \nmedical emergency, death, divorce, or separation, but he helped his adult daughter \nmake her monthly mobile home payments when she experienced separation and \ndivorce. Additionally, his sister unexpectedly looked to him for help in meeting her \nfinancial problems. Because of mold problems, unexpected repairs had to be made to \nhis home. Applicant was unable to rent this property until February 2009. These are \nfactors beyond his control. More importantly, Applicant has acted responsibly by paying \nhis debts, contacting his creditors, and establishing a separate account in order to make \ndirect payments on his remaining debts. AG & 20(b) applies. \n \nAG & 20(c) applies for there are clear indications Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties \nare under control. He is living within his means, paying his debts, meeting his monthly \nobligations, and funding a retirement account. AG & 20(d) applies to all of his debts.  He \nhas paid three of the SOR debts and is making monthly payments on the remaining \nthree debts, which constitutes a good-faith effort to address his past due debts.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n7 \n \n \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The debts incurred were not the \ntype that indicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules \nand regulations. Money was not spent frivolously. The debts listed in the SOR were not \nincurred on luxuries. \n \nApplicant has paid three debts and is making monthly payment on the three \nremaining debts. These debts cannot be a source of improper pressure or duress. Of \ncourse, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are paid or are being paid\u2014it is \nwhether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security \nclearance. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, financial considerations: \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a\u20141.g: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n_____________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Denny Holloway, Esquire \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), on April 10, 2008. On February 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn February 25, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on March \n11, 2009. The case was assigned to me on March 20, 2009. On March 31, 2009, a \nNotice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for April 22, 2009. The hearing \nwas held, as scheduled. The Government offered three exhibits which were admitted as \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov) 1 - 3 without objection. The Applicant testified, and offered \nthree exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 C without objection. \nJune 3, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nThe transcript was received on May 7, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the SOR allegations.   \n \nApplicant is a 68-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking to maintain his security clearance.  He is a program manager and has been \nemployed with his company for over 20 years. Prior to his employment with the \ncompany, Applicant served 30 years on active duty with the United States Army. He \nretired as a Command Sergeant Major. He has held a security clearance for over 50 \nyears. He is divorced and has two adult daughters. (Tr at 12-13, 20, 29, 49; Gov 1)   \n \nApplicant started drinking alcohol when he was 20 years-old. He drank beer and \nhad an occasional cocktail. His alcohol use never made him late for work. He has never \nsuffered from blackouts or hallucinations because of his alcohol use. He has never \nsuffered from alcohol withdrawal symptoms. (Tr at 20-21) \n \nIn 2006, Applicant was divorced from his second wife. He describes the following \ntwo years as a low point in his life. He started drinking more alcohol than he should. He \nwould drink approximately eight beers at his heaviest level of drinking. (Tr at 13, 25-26)  \n \nOn November 7, 2006, Applicant was drinking at a bar with some friends/co-\nworkers. They were celebrating because they had been awarded a contract. He admits \nthat he had too much alcohol to drink. The bar where he was drinking was \napproximately two to three miles from his home. He lives in a rural area. He was \nstopped at a traffic stop. The police officer noticed that he smelled like alcohol. He was \ngiven and failed a field sobriety test and was subsequently arrested for Driving Under \nthe Influence of Alcohol. A blood alcohol content (B.A.C.) test taken at the police station \nindicated a 0.18 alcohol level in Applicant\u2019s system. (Tr at 18) On April 11, 2007, he \npled not guilty to the offense but was found guilty and sentenced to a $1,000 fine, \n$142.50 in court costs, 365 days jail (suspended) and two years probation. He appealed \nthe conviction. The appeal is still pending. (Tr at 38; Gov 2; Gov 3) \n \nOn February 9, 2008, Applicant was drinking in a local bar with friends between 2 \npm and 7 pm. He drank approximately 8-9 beers during that time period. He was driving \nhome when he was pulled over by a state police officer for speeding. The police officer \nnoticed the smell of alcohol on Applicant\u2019s breath. He was arrested and charged with \nDriving Under the Influence of Alcohol, Reckless Driving, and Speeding.  A B.A.C. taken \nat the station registered at 0.21. On April 29, 2008, Applicant pled not guilty to Driving \nUnder the Influence and Reckless Driving. He pled guilty to Speeding. He was found \nguilty of Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol and Reckless Driving.  His sentence \nconsisted of fines, court costs, 365 days in jail (suspended) and he was ordered to \nattend an alcohol awareness program. His license was suspended. He appealed his \n\n \n3 \n \n \nconvictions for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol and Reckless Driving. His appeal \nwas denied in early April 2009. (Tr at 19, 34-38; Gov 3) \n \nOn May 10, 2008, Applicant was cited for Driving While his License was \nSuspended. On that day, Applicant drove to a convenience store located down the road \nfrom his house.  The state trooper who arrested him for DUI pulled into the parking lot \nand recognized him and cited him for Driving While his License was Suspended. (Tr at \n41-42)  \n \nAfter both of his arrests, Applicant occasionally drank alcohol. He does not \nbelieve that he has a drinking problem. His normal drinking patterns was four to six \nbeers on Fridays or Saturdays. He describes an alcoholic as someone who physically \ndepends on alcohol. He does not need alcohol. On the advice of his attorney, he \nenrolled in a court referral program and attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. He \nstopped drinking alcohol in early March 2009 because it was a condition of the program. \nHe enrolled in the court referral program on his own because he knew he would \neventually have to attend the program. The program began about six weeks ago. He \nbegan to attend AA meetings three weeks prior to the hearing. He has attended two \nmeetings. (Tr at 21-27) \n \nA defendant progress report from the Court Referral Officer Program indicates \nthat Applicant is in compliance with the recommendations of the program. He has \ncompleted three of nine monitoring sessions. (AE A) He has not received a diagnosis of \nalcohol abuse or alcohol dependence from a duly qualified medical professional (e.g. \nphysician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) or from a licensed clinical social worker. \n \nThe Senior Vice President of Applicant\u2019s company wrote a letter on Applicant\u2019s \nbehalf. He has known Applicant for over 20 years. He states during those 20 years \nApplicant has accepted increasing roles of management responsibility and authority. He \nhas always excelled. He can attest to Applicant\u2019s great integrity, credibility, and \ntrustworthy values. He notes Applicant is a true leader in the company. (AE C) \n \nThe Vice President of Applicant\u2019s division and his direct supervisor for the past \nfour years states that Applicant accomplishes his duties in an outstanding manner. His \nabilities and management skills are truly exemplary and set the example for the sixty \nemployees he supervises on a daily basis. He states Applicant is a very talented, hard \nworking individual. His character and credibility are beyond reproach.  He indicates \nApplicant works in a job where security is of paramount importance. He ensures that all \nemployees are aware of the security aspects of their positions. Applicant\u2019s supervisor \nhas complete confidence in Applicant\u2019s judgment and character. He has been in the \nbusiness for over thirty years and Applicant is a truly exceptional individual and \nemployee. (AE B)  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG & 21:       \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. The following disqualifying conditions are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nAlcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (AC DC) \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related \nincidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or \nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) applies. \nApplicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence on two occasions. \nThe first arrest occurred on November 7, 2006. The second arrest occurred on February \n9, 2008.  \n \nAC DC &22(c) (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the person is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or \nalcohol dependent) applies. Applicant admits that he was drinking heavier than usual \nbetween 2006 to 2008. He usually drank on the weekends. He drank up to eight beers \nin one sitting at his heaviest level of consumption. Drinking this amount of alcohol in one \nsitting can impair a person\u2019s judgment.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from alcohol consumption. \n \nAlcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) \u00b6 23(a) (so much time has \npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. While serious concerns \nare raised pertaining to Applicant\u2019s two arrests for Driving Under the Influence in \nNovember 2006 and February 2008, he has not had any alcohol-related issues in over \n14 months.  He never had any alcohol-related issues during his 30 years of active duty \nin the United States Army. These two arrests were the only alcohol-related issues that \noccurred during his twenty years of employment with a defense contractor. There is no \nrecord evidence that indicates he is alcohol dependent. His alcohol use has not affected \nhis employment performance. These alcohol arrests are the product of Applicant\u2019s \ndifficulty adapting after his 2006 divorce as opposed to a chronic alcohol problem.   \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nAC MC & 23(b) (the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of \nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an \nalcohol abuser) applies.  Applicant admits that he consumed a heavy amount of alcohol \nin the recent past. However, he decreased his alcohol consumption and completely \nstopped drinking when he enrolled in the Court Referral Officer Program because it was \na requirement of the program.  He does not need to consume alcohol. He has attended \ntwo AA meetings but only in anticipation of future court requirements.  After his divorce, \nhe underwent a period where his alcohol use was a concern. Applicant\u2019s issues with \nalcohol have stabilized.  \n \nAC MC \u00b6 23 (c) (the individual is a current employee who is participating in a \ncounseling or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and \nis making satisfactory progress) applies. Applicant is making satisfactory progress in the \nCourt Referral Officer Program. He has no previous history of alcohol treatment or \nrelapse.  His 30-year track record of military service and lengthy favorable employment \nhistory indicate the issues related to alcohol consumption were a departure from his \nusual standard of conduct.  \n \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised under alcohol consumption. \nGuideline G is found for Applicant.  \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern raised under the criminal conduct guideline is set forth in \u00b6 \n30 of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines: \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \n \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \n \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThere are two Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) which apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case, CC DC \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and \nCC DC \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted). Applicant was arrested \nand convicted for Driving Under the Influence on two occasions. Driving Under the \nInfluence is a serious criminal offense.  Although the appeal of his November 2006 is \npending, Applicant admitted that his B.A.C. was over the legal limit on the night of his \narrest.  He was also cited in May 2008 for Driving on a Suspended License.   \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence by way of exhibits and testimony \nto raise CC DC \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c). The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns (Directive \u00b6E3.1.15). An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. \nSeptember 22, 2005.)   \n\n \n7 \n \n \n  The following Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) are relevant to \nApplicant\u2019s case: \n \nCC MC \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. \nMore than 14 months have passed since Applicant\u2019s second DUI offense. He has no \nalcohol-related incidents since that time. While he showed poor judgment when he \ndecided to drive while his license was suspended in May 2008, the incident occurred \nover a year ago and did not involve alcohol.  He has had no subsequent arrests.  \nApplicant went through a rough period after his divorce and has learned a difficult \nlesson as a result of his past drinking and driving. It is unlikely that he will repeat similar \nbehavior again. His past conduct, while serious, no longer casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness or good judgment.  \n \nCC MC \u00b6 33(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement) applies. More than one year has passed since Applicant\u2019s last \noffense. He is making satisfactory progress in the Court Referral Officer Program which \nhe enrolled in before the court ordered him to do so. His job performance has not \nsuffered as a result of his arrests. While Applicant is still on probation, it is likely he will \nsuccessfully complete the terms of his probation. Applicant appeared to be honest and \nstraight-forward during the hearing. He made no excuse for his past actions. He has an \nexcellent employment record. Applicant has mitigated the criminal conduct concern. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s thirty years \nof active duty service in the United States Army and his twenty years of employment \nwith a Department of Defense contractor. While Applicant\u2019s two DUIs within the past \n\n \n8 \n \n \nthree years raise serious issues about his alcohol consumption, I also considered the \nimpact of Applicant\u2019s 2006 divorce. Applicant proactively entered the Court Referral \nOfficer Program in anticipation of the court requiring him to attend the program. He is \nmaking satisfactory progress in the program.  Applicant was forthright and honest during \nhis testimony and acknowledges the error of his ways. More than one year has passed \nsince his last offense. The letters from his superiors indicate that his alcohol use never \naffected his job performance. His alcohol use never raised a concern during his 30 \nyears of active duty military service nor during his 20-year career with a defense \ncontractor. He is taking steps to get his life back on track. The two Driving Under the \nInfluence arrests appear to be an exception to an otherwise stellar career. Although \nApplicant has not completed the terms of his probation, the likelihood that he will \nsuccessfully complete probation is high. There is substantial evidence to conclude that \nApplicant mitigated the concerns related to his alcohol use.  He is aware that future \nproblems with alcohol use could jeopardize his ability to maintain a security clearance. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption, and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, are found for \nApplicant.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 7, 2012, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline \nG, alcohol consumption. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 2, 2012, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 22, 2012. DOHA issued \na notice of hearing on July 10, 2012, scheduling the hearing for August 7, 2012. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9 were \n10/02/2012\n\n \n2 \n \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, called a witness, and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were admitted without objection. \nThe record was held open until September 17, 2012, and then extended to October 1, \n2012, for Applicant to submit additional information. He submitted a two-page document \nthat was marked AE E and admitted without objection. Correspondence about the \nadditional exhibit is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on August 15, 2012.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 1999. He seeks to retain his security clearance, which he \nhas held since about 2000. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree.

The allegation was apparently based on the SF 86, which listed the \nwrong year for Applicant\u2019s DUI. I find that Applicant was arrested for DUI in November \n2002, as addressed above, but he was not arrested for DUI in 2001.  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in July 2005 and charged with DUI extreme with blood \nalcohol concentration (BAC) of .15% or more, first offense; DUI with BAC of .08% or \nmore, first offense; DUI, first offense; and failure to stop for red light. He pleaded guilty \nto DUI extreme with BAC of .15% or more, first offense, and the other charges were \ndismissed. He was sentenced to 180 days in jail, with 170 days suspended upon \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 38-39; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 37; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 7. \n \n3 Tr. at 37; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 4. \n \n4 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1. \n\n \n3 \n \nsuccessful completion of alcohol evaluation and counseling; supervised probation for \ntwo years; and fines and fees of about $2,900. Conditions of his probation included \nattendance at a victim impact panel, suspended driver\u2019s license for one year, and an \nignition interlock was placed on his car for one year.5 \n \n \nThe day after his last arrest, Applicant voluntarily checked himself into an \ninpatient alcohol treatment program at a hospital. He was in the hospital for about five \ndays. While in the program, he was diagnosed by a doctor with alcohol dependence, \ngeneral anxiety disorder, and depression disorder not otherwise specified.6  \n \n \nApplicant continued at an outpatient substance abuse treatment program from \nAugust 2005 through November 2005. Medical records from the program were not \nintroduced. If there was a diagnosis, it is not apparent from the evidence.7  \n \n \nApplicant was assessed by a licensed professional counselor (LPC) in December \n2006, January 2007, and November 2011. In December 2006, he was administered the \nSubstance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory (SASSI). The scale scores of the SASSI \nmet the \u201ccriteria for classifying [Applicant] as having a high probability of being \nsubstance dependent.\u201d The LPC noted that \u201c[i]n addition to test results, supplemental \nclinical information is required to meet the accepted standards for a DSM-IV diagnosis \nof a Substance Abuse Disorder.\u201d8   \n \n \nApplicant was assessed by another LPC at DOHA\u2019s request in January 2009. \nThe LPC did not specifically address alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse. She \nrecommended Applicant for a security clearance, noting: \n \nIt is my professional opinion that the 2005 incident was a culmination of \nstress. That it was in the past, he has learned from it and will never be \nrepeated. He has a strong sense of responsibility to self, family and his \nprofession. He knows the signs of stress and he now has healthy skills to \nuse to relieve the stress so that the 2005 incident will never be repeated.9 \n \n \nThe first LPC assessed Applicant again in November 2011. She reported that \n\u201c[b]oth the standard instruments and [her] interview with [Applicant] indicated a history \nof alcohol abuse, which he reported most often took the form of intermittent binge \ndrinking.\u201d He also reported that he \u201chas been drinking only moderately, i.e., not to the \npoint of intoxication.\u201d10 The LPC further noted: \n                                                          \n5 Tr. at 23, 37; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 4, 7. \n \n6 Tr. at 23-24; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 9. \n \n7 Tr. at 24, 39; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 4, 7. \n \n8 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 8. \n \n9 GE 6. \n \n10 Tr. at 36; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 8. \n\n \n4 \n \nOn all occasions that I met with him, [Applicant] showed no signs of acute \nintoxication or withdrawal and presented as a very cooperative, pleasant \ngentleman. I was struck by the high level of insight he demonstrated and \nthe willingness to admit, rather than deny, the negative effect of his \nalcohol abuse. He was also able to report many positive aspects of \nsobriety or limiting his drinking, which is generally a very good prognostic \nindicator. As indicated above, however, I have a very limited history with \nhim and \u2013 as with all cases of substance abuse \u2013 there is always a risk of \nrelapse, and whether it will or will not occur is impossible to predict. At this \ntime, however, I would say that my prognosis is fairly good and his past \nalcohol abuse and current moderate use of alcohol are not interfering with \nhis employment.11 \n \n \nApplicant still drinks alcohol, but he stated that he only drinks responsibly. He \nbelieves he has learned from his past mistakes and they will not be repeated. He was \nevaluated at an outpatient substance abuse recovery center on September 19, 2012. \nThe qualifications of the individual who made the evaluation are unclear, but the person \nreporting the evaluation is identified as the \u201cAdmin Director,\u201d and the treatment plan is \nsigned by a person identified as a \u201cClinician.\u201d The report noted that the evaluation was \n\u201c[b]ased on state standard SASSI and MAST (Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test)12 \ntesting as well as assessment interview.\u201d A diagnosis was not provided, but it was \ndetermined that no substance abuse treatment was required. The short-term goal was \nto not drink and drive. The long-term goal was to develop a plan to deal with ongoing \nstress and to continue to attend \u201cChurch Group.\u201d13 \n \nApplicant submitted a number of letters and documents, and a witness attested \nto Applicant\u2019s excellent job performance, trustworthiness, dedication, work ethic, and \nintegrity.14 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \n                                                          \n11 GE 8. \n \n12 See, e.g., http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1960508/. \n \n13 Tr. at 25-31, 36-40; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4, 7; AE E. \n \n14 Tr. at 15-22; AE C, D. \n\n \n5 \n \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21:   \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \n\n \n6 \n \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;  \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent;  \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence;  \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program; and \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program. \n \n \nApplicant has a number of alcohol-related arrests, including three arrests for \nDUIs. He admits that he drank alcohol to excess and to the point of intoxication. While \nin an inpatient alcohol treatment program at a hospital in 2005, he was diagnosed by a \ndoctor with alcohol dependence. In December 2006, the scale scores of the SASSI met \nthe \u201ccriteria for classifying [Applicant] as having a high probability of being substance \ndependent.\u201d In 2011, an LPC reported that Applicant had a history of alcohol abuse. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(c), 22(d), and 22(e) are applicable. There is no evidence that Applicant \nreturned to uncontrolled drinking after completion of the alcohol treatment program. AG \n\u00b6 22(f) is not applicable. \n \n \nApplicant was arrested three times for DUI, but he was not arrested the fourth \ntime alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. That allegation is concluded for Applicant.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); and  \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \n\n \n7 \n \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last alcohol-related arrest was in July 2005. He completed inpatient \nand outpatient alcohol treatment. He still drinks alcohol, but he stated that he only drinks \nresponsibly. There is contradictory evidence as to whether Applicant is alcohol \ndependent or an alcohol abuser. I give the recent evaluations the most weight. He \nreceived favorable endorsements from two LPCs and an \u201cAdmin Director\u201d of an \noutpatient substance abuse recovery center in January 2009, November 2011, and \nSeptember 2012. I find that Applicant has established a pattern of responsible alcohol \nuse and that uncontrolled drinking is unlikely to recur. His current alcohol consumption \ndoes not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), \n23(b), and 23(d) are applicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline G in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence and work record. Applicant \nhad a problematic history with alcohol, including three DUI arrests, but he has not had \nan alcoholic-related arrest in more than seven years. He currently drinks responsibly \nand in moderation. He received favorable endorsements from two LPCs and an \u201cAdmin \nDirector\u201d of an outpatient substance abuse recovery center. I am convinced Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \nhas control over his alcohol use and that there is little likelihood of recurrence of alcohol \nproblems. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated alcohol consumption security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

On February 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security\nconcerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 30, 2009. He answered\nthe SOR in writing through counsel on March 31, 2009, and requested a hearing before\nJuly 17, 2009\n\nGE 1; Tr. 28-30.\n1\nGE 1; Tr. 31-34, 37.\n2\n2\nan administrative judge. DOHA received the request on April 1, 2009. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on April 24, 2009, and I received the case\nassignment on April 27, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 8, 2009, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on June 9, 2009. The government offered five\nexhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He submitted seven exhibits (AE) A\nthrough G, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 16, 2009. I held the record open until\nJune 23, 2009, for Applicant to submit additional matters. On June 16, 2009, he\nsubmitted five exhibits, AE H through AE L, without objection. The record closed on\nJune 16, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel advised that the debt amount in allegation \u00b6 1.d of the SOR\nwas incorrect. Department Counsel indicated that the debt amount should be $631, not\n$1,631 and asked that the SOR be corrected. Applicant\u2019s counsel did not object.\nAllegation \u00b6 1.d of the SOR is corrected to reflect a debt of $631.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d\nand 1.e of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the remaining factual allegations of\nthe SOR. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for\na security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 51 years old, works for a Department of Defense contractor as\nan electronics technician. He has worked for this company for many years. Applicant\ngraduated from high school, then completed a four-year apprenticeship in navigational\nsystems.  The federal government granted him a security clearance in 1970 or 1971. He\nhas held a security clearance continuously since this time without any violations of the\nrules and regulations for handling classified information. Applicant is not married and\nhas no children.1\nApplicant worked for his company or its predecessor for 18 years in the East. In\n2002, he accepted a work transfer offered by his company and moved west. In 2004,\nthe government contract held by his company came up for bid. To retain his\nemployment through the contract bidding process, his company transferred him to the\nMidwest. His company lost the contract bid and Applicant remained in the Midwest for\nnearly three years.2\n\nTr. 30-36.\n3\nId. at 37.\n4\nGE 2 (Credit report, dated October 7, 2008); GE 3 (Credit report, dated June 12, 2008); AE E (Credit report,\n5\ndated June 8, 2009); AE F (Credit report, dated March 29, 2009).\n3\nApplicant did not have financial problems until he moved to the Midwest at his\nown expense and took a $30,000 pay cut. He exhausted his savings paying bills, and\nhe curtailed his expenses, including cancelling his cable TV service and internet access\nat home. While living in the Midwest, family emergencies required him to fly East\nseveral times. As a result, he incurred additional expenses beyond his budget. He met\nwith a financial counseling service and retained the company when he still lived in the\nMidwest. He later discovered that this company was not paying his usual bills, such as\nhis car payment, as he had expected. He discontinued this company\u2019s services and\nworked on his own to resolve his debt issues.  \n3\nIn June 2007, Applicant transferred to the East and received a substantial\nincrease in salary. Once he settled into his new job and home, Applicant contacted his\ncreditors and started paying his debts.4\nAfter reviewing the credit reports dated June 12, 2008, October 7, 2008, March\n29, 2009, June 8, 2009, and the SOR, I have compiled a list of the total debts owed,\nexcluding any duplicate entries. I find that Applicant\u2019s actual debts are as follows:5\nSOR \u00b6\nTYPE OF DEBT\nAMOUNT\nSTATUS\nEVIDENCE\n1.a\nUtility bill\n$     205.00\nPaid\nAE F, page 37\n1.b\nCredit card\n$  3,311.00\nPaying $200 month,\nBalance $1,310\nAE D; Tr. 37\n1.c\nLoan account\n$14,711.00\nDisputes balance;\nPaying $200 month\nAE G; AE H; AE\nI; AE K; Tr. 46-50\n1.d\nCredit card\n$     631.00\nUnpaid; Creditor\nhas no record of\ndebt\nTr. 50-51\n1.e\nCredit account\n$  1,325.00\nPaid\nAE E; AE G; AE\nH; AE I; Tr. 51-52\n1.f\nCollection\naccount\n$     986.00\nSettled for $600;\nPaid $400; Balance\nto be paid in June\n2009\nAE I; Tr. 54-56 \n\nGE 4 (Response to interrogatories with attachments); AE A; Tr. 93.\n6\nTr. 50-51, 70, 73-75.\n7\nTr. 67-69.\n8\n4\n1.g\nCollection\naccount\n$  1,720.00\nPaying $100 month,\nBalance $1,120\nAE I; Tr. 58-60\n1.h\nCollection\naccount \n$     779.00\nSettled and Paid\nAE J; Tr. 60-61\n1.i\nCollection\naccount\n$     100.00\nPaid\nTr. 61-62\n1.j\nStore Account\n$     601.00\nPaid\nGE 4; AE C; Tr.\n62-63\nApplicant currently earns $69,500 a year. His gross monthly income totals $5,795\nand his net monthly income totals $3,837. His usual monthly expenses include rent,\nfood, utilities, automobile expenses, car payment, and insurance, for a total of $1,848.\nHe uses his remaining income to repay his old debts. He pays three creditors a total of\n$500 each month, and he also pays smaller loans. His landlord verified he timely pays\nhis rent.  \n6\nApplicant acknowledged the debts in allegations 1.c and 1.d. He borrowed up to\n$3,000 from the creditor identified in 1.d when he lived in the West and Midwest, not the\namount listed in his credit reports. He filed a dispute with the credit reporting company,\nchallenging the balance of this debt. Concerning the credit card debt in 1.c, Applicant\ncontacted the creditor, who has no record of an account in his name. The creditor\nadvised the account had been sold, but could not provide any information about who\ncurrently owns the account. As no other information exists on this account, Applicant\ncannot resolve this debt.   \n7\nIn February 2009, Applicant suffered a stroke, received hospital treatment and\nunderwent physical therapy. During his illness, Applicant paid all his bills, including his\ndebt repayment. He has also paid all his medical bills. Applicant developed a plan for\nfinancial recovery and followed it.8\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n5\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\n\n6\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt following a significant\ndecrease in income. He was unable to pay some obligations for a period of time. The\nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ This mitigating\ncondition is not applicable. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant accepted a job\ntransfer in 2002 and a second job transfer in 2004. He moved in 2004 to preserve his\nemployment. The move, however, cost him $30,000 in income loss and resulted in debt\naccumulation. Applicant eventually obtained a better paying job. Once he settled in his\nnew location, he contacted his creditors and began repaying his debts. He acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances. This mitigating condition applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant retained a counseling service several years ago, but\ndiscontinued the service when he learned this company was not paying his bills\nproperly. This decision shows sound judgment on his part. Once his financial\ncircumstances improved, he contacted his creditors and began the long process of\npaying his delinquent debts. He has resolved many of his delinquent debts, either by\npayment or settlement. He pays the remaining debts through monthly payment plans.\nHe is now financially sound. I conclude these mitigating conditions apply.\nFinally, an applicant may mitigate security concerns under AG \u00b6 20 (e) if \u201cthe\nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is\nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of\nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d Applicant disputed the\n\n7\ndebt listed in SOR allegation \u00b6 1.c as he believed the balance on this account is\nincorrect. He acknowledged owing money to this creditor; but, he believed the balance\nwas excessive. His decision to dispute this debt is reasonable based on his knowledge\nof the actual amount of money borrowed from the creditor. The credit reporting agency\nhas not responded to his notice of dispute nor resolved the conflict in information about\nthis debt. This mitigating condition has some applicability to this one debt.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant incurred delinquent debts\nwhen he accepted a much lower paying job in order to continue working. He initially\nbelieved this position would be temporary, but it lasted three years and significantly\nimpacted his ability to pay his monthly expenses. He decided to find better paying\nemployment, which he obtained in 2007. His new job again required him to move a\nsignificant distance. Once he settled in his new job and new location, he initiated\ncontacts with his creditors about repayment of his debts. He developed a plan to resolve\nhis debts and has followed his plan.\nOver the last five years, Applicant has exercised good judgment in the\nmanagement of his financial resources, especially during difficult circumstances. He\ndiscontinued his internet access and cable television when his bills became\nunmanageable. He looked for ways to pay his debts on his reduced income, including\nretaining a debt counseling service. When this service failed to properly manage his\nfinances, he stopped it and assumed full responsibility for his debt repayment. He is a\nresponsible individual who found himself in circumstances beyond his control. He\ndeveloped a track record for resolving his old debt. Most significantly, he has taken\naffirmative action to pay or resolve most of the delinquent debts raising security\n\n8\nconcerns. (See AG & 2(a)(6).) His debts cannot be a source of improper pressure or\nduress. Of importance in this case is the fact that he has held a security clearance for\nnearly 40 years without incident. Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts\nare paid----it is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to\nhold a security clearance. While some debts remain unpaid, the debts are insufficient to\nraise security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for her current employer since 2006. She seeks to retain a security clearance she has held for more than 20 years. She is a high school graduate. She was married for more than 25 years, but she is currently divorced. She has an adult child.1 Applicant was born in another country. She came to the United States more than 30 years ago, and she became a U.S. citizen in the mid-1980s. English is her third language, as she learned a second language in her country of origin. Applicant worked for her former employer from 2004 to 2006.2 Applicant maintained two notebooks while working for her former employer. She wrote in the notebooks in her native language, which has a different alphabet and characters than English. She also wrote some words in English, if the words did not properly translate to the foreign language. She intended to use one of the notebooks to train her replacement. At some point, Applicant copied confidential frequencies into one of the books. The two pages with the confidential frequencies were eventually covered by other paper that was taped to the pages.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 24, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines K (Handling Protected Information) and E (Personal Conduct). The action \nwas taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nthe Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 6, 2010, and on April 30, 2010, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nOctober 29, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \nJune 14, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 13, 2010, and the hearing was \nconvened as scheduled on August 11, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 5, which were received without objection. Applicant testified and called two \nwitnesses but did not submit any documentary evidence. The record was held open for \nApplicant to submit additional information. Applicant submitted a letter that was marked \nExhibit (AE) A and admitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s attorney\u2019s letter is marked \nHearing Exhibit (HE) I; Department Counsel\u2019s memorandum is marked HE II. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 19, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer since 2006. She seeks to retain a security clearance she has held \nfor more than 20 years. She is a high school graduate. She was married for more than \n25 years, but she is currently divorced. She has an adult child.1  \n \n \nApplicant was born in another country. She came to the United States more than \n30 years ago, and she became a U.S. citizen in the mid-1980s. English is her third \nlanguage, as she learned a second language in her country of origin. Applicant worked \nfor her former employer from 2004 to 2006.2   \n \n \nApplicant maintained two notebooks while working for her former employer. She \nwrote in the notebooks in her native language, which has a different alphabet and \ncharacters than English. She also wrote some words in English, if the words did not \nproperly translate to the foreign language. She intended to use one of the notebooks to \ntrain her replacement. At some point, Applicant copied confidential frequencies into one \nof the books. The two pages with the confidential frequencies were eventually covered \nby other paper that was taped to the pages. Applicant left the notebooks in her desk \ndrawer when she left the company.3 \n \n \nThe notebooks were discovered in the desk drawer by another employee and \nwere brought to the attention of the company\u2019s facility security officer (FSO), about \nseven weeks after Applicant left the company. The FSO was concerned that the \nnotebooks could contain classified information. The FSO determined that the \nnotebooks, except for the two pages with the confidential frequencies that were covered \nwith the taped paper, did not contain any additional classified information. The FSO \nnoted that the notebooks were unsecured in the desk.4 The FSO does not believe that \nthe notebooks were read, nor classified information compromised, for three reasons: \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 25-26, 43-46, 57-58; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 44, 58; GE 1, 2. \n \n3 Tr. at 22-39, 50-54; Applicant\u2019s responses to SOR; GE 2, 3. \n \n4 GE 3. \n\n \n3 \n \n[T]hey were written in [foreign language], no one else in the group of \ntechnicians spoke [foreign language], and the frequencies had been \ncovered by other pages taped and stapled over them. Regardless, the \npossibility of compromise cannot be eliminated.5 \n \n \nApplicant testified that she has learned from this incident and would not repeat \nsuch behavior. She has not had a security infraction since the incident. She attended \nher current employer\u2019s required annual security refresher training in July 2010, and she \npassed the quiz the FSO gave at the end of the training. In August 2010, the FSO gave \nApplicant individualized training on the company\u2019s standard initial security briefing. This \nis the same briefing that is provided to all new employees the first time they are granted \na security clearance.6 As prescribed in the National Industrial Security Program \nOperating Manual (NISPOM), the initial security briefing includes: \n \na. A threat awareness briefing. \nb. A defensive security briefing. \nc. An overview of the security classification system. \nd. Employee reporting obligations and requirements. \ne. Security procedures and duties applicable to the employee\u2019s job.7 \n \nThe FSO certified it was his observation that Applicant understood everything that was \ncovered in the security briefing.8 \n \nTwo witnesses appeared on Applicant\u2019s behalf. They testified she is dedicated, \nhardworking, takes pride in her work, a perfectionist, conscientious, and she \u201cstrives to \ndo the best she can.\u201d9   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \n                                                          \n5 Id. \n \n6 Tr. at 33, 39-41, 58-59, 66; AE A. \n \n7 AE A. \n \n8 Id. \n \n9 Tr. at 61-82. \n\n \n4 \n \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \n \n \nThe security concern for Handling Protected Information is set out in AG \u00b6 33: \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nprotecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an \nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 34 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(b) collecting or storing classified or other protected information at home or \nin any other unauthorized location;  \n \n(e) copying classified or other protected information in a manner designed \nto conceal or remove classification or other document control markings; \nand \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \nsensitive information.  \n \n \nApplicant copied classified information into a notebook without authorization, and \nfailed to ensure that it was properly safeguarded. The evidence raises all the above \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate Handling Protected Information security concerns \nare provided under AG \u00b6 35. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s security violations occurred more than four years ago. Her actions \nwere not discovered until she left employment at her previous job in 2006. She has lived \nin the United States for more than three decades, and she has held a security clearance \nfor more than 20 years. However, English is her third language. I believe a language \nbarrier may have played some role in her actions. She has not had any security \ninfractions at her new job. She received her annual training and passed a quiz. She \nreceived individual training from her FSO, who stated he believed Applicant understood \neverything that was covered in the briefing. After listening to her testimony, hearing her \nwitnesses, and reviewing all other evidence, I am convinced that Applicant is remorseful \nfor her actions, and she will not repeat the behavior. She possesses a positive attitude \ntoward the discharge of her security responsibilities. I find both mitigating conditions to \nbe applicable.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct was alleged under the Handling Protected Information \nguideline, as addressed above. It constitutes credible adverse information in another \nadjudicative issue area that may not be sufficient for an adverse determination under \nany other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It also constitutes personal conduct \nthat could create a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) \nand 16(e) have been raised as disqualifying conditions. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nThe discussion under the guideline for Handling Protected Information is equally \nappropriate for this guideline. Additionally, Applicant has been open and honest about \nthe conduct which has reduced any potential vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, \nand duress. The above mitigating conditions are applicable.  \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines K and E in this whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant committed security violations by improperly copying classified \ninformation into a notebook and not properly safeguarding the notebook. This occurred \nbefore she left her former job in 2006. Security violations are one of the strongest \npossible reasons for denying or revoking access to classified information, as they raise \nvery serious questions about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified \ninformation. Once it is established that an applicant has committed a security violation, \nhe or she has a very heavy burden of demonstrating that he or she should be entrusted \nwith classified information. Because security violations strike at the very heart of the \nindustrial security program, an administrative judge must give any claims of reform and \nrehabilitation strict scrutiny. In many security clearance cases, applicants are denied a \nclearance for having an indicator of a risk that they might commit a security violation \n(e.g., alcohol abuse, delinquent debts, or drug use). Security violation cases reveal \nmore than simply an indicator of risk.10 The frequency and duration of the security \nviolations are also aggravating factors.11  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence along with all the other \nevidence. This incident appears to be an isolated incident and out of character for \n                                                          \n10 ISCR Case No. 03-26888 (App. Bd. Oct. 5, 2006). \n \n11 ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 5 (App. Bd. July 14, 1998). \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nApplicant. I believe it was at least partially caused by a language barrier. I further \nbelieve the discovery of the notebook and the experience of going through the \nadjudicative process had an additional value, in that Applicant is more cognizant that \nshe must ensure that she completely understands all that is required of someone \nresponsible for maintaining and safeguarding classified information. Applicant has met \nher heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto continue her security clearance.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated Handling Protected Information and Personal Conduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 47 and married. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F, Financial Considerations The Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Applicant admits all of the allegations under Paragraph 1 of the SOR. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact. Applicant testified about his financial situation. He stated that his family\u2019s financial difficulties began when they were remodeling their house, and his contractor abandoned the work when it was only partially completed. Applicant began using his own funds to complete the work, which eventually got to be more than he and his wife could pay. As of the time of the hearing, the Applicant was in the midst of completing a short sale for the house. (Transcript at 48-54, 66-69.) In order to resolve the debt, Applicant signed on with a debt relief company in January 2008. He gave the company $8,000 over approximately six months, and they did nothing for him.

(Government Exhibit 1.) On July 27, 2009, the Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines F and E concerning Applicant. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted Answers to the SOR on August 20 and December 8, 2009,\nand requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge.

DOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 16, 2009, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on January 27, 2010. The Government offered Government\nExhibits 1 through 9, which were received without objection. The Applicant testified on\n\n2\nhis own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through M, also received without\nobjection.  The record was left open at the Applicant\u2019s request for the submission of\nadditional documentation. The Applicant submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit N on February 9,\n2010.

He submitted character reference letters from\nhis Director, as well as two co-workers. Applicant is described as being \u201ctrustworthy,\u201d\n\u201ccommitted, loyal,\u201d and \u201ca dependable and reliable employee.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit A.) He\nhas also received written commendations from his employers. (Applicant Exhibit C.) \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision. In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his or her own\ncommon sense, as well as knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\n\n5\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant, by his own admission, and supported by the documentary\nevidence, had $158,163 in past-due debts, all of which have been due and owing for\n\n6\nseveral years. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying\nconditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose primarily because of the money it cost to remodel his house.\nOnce Applicant and his wife realized the extent of their indebtedness, they began\nworking to try and resolve it. He has paid off three of the past due debts, completed\nnegotiations to pay off his remaining past due indebtedness, has made payments to all\nof his creditors, and his current financial situation is stable. This mitigating condition\napplies to this case. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances.\u201d  As stated above, the Applicant\u2019s debt situation was brought\nabout primarily by the bad faith of his contractor, a situation that will not be repeated.\nThis mitigating condition also applies.\nApplicant has initiated a good-faith effort to pay off his creditors. Through\nnegotiation and payment, Applicant has reduced his indebtedness to $102,947.\nAccordingly, AG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable.  \nApplicant is over $100,000 in debt. However, the record is clear that he is not\nrunning up new debt. Indeed, he is paying his debts in a responsible manner. Under the\nparticular circumstances of this case, I find that \u201cthere are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c).\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\n\n7\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The discussion under\nGuideline F, above, applies here as well. Applicant, with the best of intentions, wound\nup in financial straits. However, he has a well-thought-out and reasonable plan, which\nhe is carrying out. His current financial condition is stable. Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), I find that\nthere have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). Accordingly, at the\npresent time, I find that there is little to no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation,\nor duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)); and that there is no likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nsituation. Accordingly, the evidence supports granting his request for a security\nclearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.j.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nWITHDRAWN\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nWithdrawn\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  Eligibility\nfor access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact2 In Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, except he updated the status of his probation and the criminal convictions (Item 3). He also explained why he believed he was not a security risk. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 56-year-old employee of a defense contractor.3 He has approximately 18 months of college education. He married in 1980 and divorced in 2002. He remarried in 2008. His children were born in 1971 and 1981. He has been a consultant to a defense contractor since 2001. He has never served in the U.S. military. In 2000, he quit his job after being told he was going to be fired. The 2000 termination of employment resulted from Applicant\u2019s disclosure of his being charged with sexual offenses involving children. Aside from the sexual offenses at issue, his file does not contain any other adverse information relating to police involvement. For example, he has never been charged with any other felonies, any firearms or explosives offense(s), and does not have any currently pending charges. He has never been charged with any offense related to alcohol or drugs. There is no evidence that he has abused alcohol or drugs. There is no evidence of civil court actions or financial delinquencies. 1The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated May 21, 2009; and App",

This conduct shows such extremely poor \njudgment that more time without conduct raising security concerns is needed. Applicant \nfailed to mitigate sexual behavior concerns. Criminal conduct security concerns are \nmitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 31, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF-86) (Item 4). \nOn March 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated \nby the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nJuly 16, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines D (Sexual Behavior) and J \n(Criminal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn April 3, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 3). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated May 20, 2009, was provided to him, \nand he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.1 Applicant responded to the FORM on June 16, 2009. The \ncase was assigned to me on July 7, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, \nexcept he updated the status of his probation and the criminal convictions (Item 3). He \nalso explained why he believed he was not a security risk. His admissions are accepted \nas findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I \nmake the following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old employee of a defense contractor.3 He has \napproximately 18 months of college education. He married in 1980 and divorced in \n2002. He remarried in 2008. His children were born in 1971 and 1981. He has been a \nconsultant to a defense contractor since 2001. He has never served in the U.S. military. \nIn 2000, he quit his job after being told he was going to be fired. The 2000 termination of \nemployment resulted from Applicant\u2019s disclosure of his being charged with sexual \noffenses involving children. Aside from the sexual offenses at issue, his file does not \ncontain any other adverse information relating to police involvement. For example, he \nhas never been charged with any other felonies, any firearms or explosives offense(s), \nand does not have any currently pending charges. He has never been charged with any \noffense related to alcohol or drugs. There is no evidence that he has abused alcohol or \ndrugs. There is no evidence of civil court actions or financial delinquencies.   \n \n \n \n1The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated May 21, 2009; \nand Applicant\u2019s receipt is dated May 26, 2009. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he \nhad 30 days after his receipt to submit information. \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n  \n3The facts in this paragraph are from Applicant\u2019s July 31, 2007, security clearance application \n(Item 4). \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nSexual Behavior and Criminal Conduct4 \n \n \nApplicant admitted in his March 14, 2008, affidavit (Item 6) to the following \nrelevant conduct in this paragraph and the next two paragraphs: \n \n[Applicant] has a long history of sexual deviancy. Since the early 1970\u2019s \nwhen [he] was in his 20\u2019s, [he has] looked at women in dressing rooms or \n[through] their bedroom windows. This happened almost weekly in the \nyears leading to 2000. During the summers,5 [he] would expose [his] \ngenitals to young girls or women at least monthly.  \n \nIn August 2000, Applicant went to an elementary school parking lot and \napproached two girls, who were ages nine or ten. He engaged them in conversation \nabout whether they had reached puberty. Applicant grabbed one of the girl\u2019s shorts and \npulled her shorts towards him so that he could look inside her shorts. She pulled away \nfrom him, and Applicant released her. Applicant\u2019s fly was down so that the girls could \nsee Applicant\u2019s genitals. \n \nApplicant also noted in his affidavit that his sex offender treating therapist, \n\u201cbelieves [he] will always be at risk for repeated [sexually deviant] behavior, and \n[Applicant] agree[s] with this assessment].\u201d6      \n \nApplicant was charged with two counts of Attempted Sexual Assault of a Child, \ntwo counts of Indecent Exposure to Minors Under 15, and four counts of harassment \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a; Item 3). In July 2001, Applicant pleaded guilty to Counts 1-4, and Counts 5-\n8 were dismissed. He received a four-year deferred judgment and sentence as to \nCounts 1 and 2 (both are Class 5 felony-level Attempt to Commit Sexual Assault on a \nChild charges). He received concurrent probation as to Counts 3 and 4 (both are Class \n2 misdemeanor-level Indecent Exposure charges).  \n \nApplicant was also sentenced to sixty days in jail (he served 37 days of \nconfinement), ordered to attend counseling and register as a sex offender. The court \nordered probation for ten years. \n \n \nIn January 2006, the District Attorney\u2019s office notified the court that Applicant had \nsuccessfully completed sex offender specific treatment as required by the terms of his \ndeferred judgment and sentence. In January 2006, the District Attorney\u2019s office filed a \nmotion to dismiss Counts 1 and 2, and to terminate probation as to Counts 3 and 4.  \n \n4Unless stated otherwise, the source for the facts in this section is Applicant\u2019s FORM response, \nespecially the Chief Deputy District Attorney\u2019s court filing in June 2009. \n \n5Applicant lives in a part of the United States where the temperature in the non-summer seasons \nis low. \n \n6Applicant concedes in his FORM response that he understands through his therapy, \u201csex \noffenders are always at risk of re-offense.\u201d However, he believes his concession is a positive, \nrehabilitative development, and argues he is at very-low risk of committing more sexual offenses.    \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nThe court failed to issue an order responding to the District Attorney\u2019s January 2006, \nmotion. \n \n \nIn June 2009, the District Attorney\u2019s office asked the court to dismiss Counts 1 \nand 2 retroactive to January 2006, and to reflect he has completed his probationary \nsentence as to Counts 3 and 4. The District Attorney\u2019s office indicated the misdemeanor \nconvictions for Counts 3 and 4 remain. In June 2009, the court granted the District \nAttorney\u2019s office\u2019s requests.  \n \n \nSex-offender treatment7 \n \n \nApplicant received sex-offender treatment from November 2000 to January 26, \n2006 (FORM response). Applicant admitted his sexual misconduct and understands \nthat there is a possibility he can re-offend. His acknowledgement of the possibility that \nhe will re-offend is a positive development because it enhances his commitment to \nrecovery. He demonstrated sincerity and empathy. He is constantly on guard to avoid \nrelapsing into sexually inappropriate conduct. His therapist evaluated him under three \nsystems for risk of re-offense and determined him to be of LOW to MEDIUM-LOW risk. \nHis therapist thought he had less than a 20% risk for re-offense within ten years. His \nrisk for re-offense will be reduced if he \u201ccontinues a program and path of recovery.\u201d \nApplicant married last year and \u201cis surrounded by a healthy support system, which can \nalso lower re-offense rates.\u201d There is no evidence that he is currently in a therapy \nprogram for sex offenders. \n   \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \n7The source for the information about Applicant\u2019s sex-offender treatment is a letter, dated June \n22, 2009, from his primary therapist, which is part of his FORM response. \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines D (Sexual Behavior) and J (Criminal Conduct).  \n \nSexual Behavior, Guideline D \n \nAG \u00b6 12 describes the concern about sexual behavior stating: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual. \n \nAG \u00b6 13 provides four conditions relating to sexual behavior that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior \nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a \npersonality disorder; \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment. \n \nApplicant admitted that he viewed women in dressing rooms and through an \nexterior window, while they were in their bedrooms on hundreds of occasions from the \nearly 1970s until 2000. During the summers of those years, he exposed his genitals to \nyoung girls or women at least monthly or approximately 50-100 times. In 2000, he was \narrested for assaulting two children in a school parking lot. His conduct constitutes \nnumerous criminal offenses and they were public to the extent that the offenses \noccurred in public areas. His sexual misbehavior violates important civil and criminal \nrules in our society, and a lengthy history of indecent exposure and voyeurism, \nculminating in attempted sexual assault on two children is conduct a person might wish \nto conceal, as it adversely affects a person\u2019s professional and community standing. \nSuch conduct also makes him vulnerable to coercion. He has a lengthy pattern of \ndeviant sexual behavior with numerous offenses over many years. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(c) \nand 13(d) apply. AG \u00b6 13(b) does not apply because Applicant has stopped his sexually \ndeviant behavior since August 2000, and there is no record evidence establishing he \nhas a personality disorder. \n \nAG \u00b6 14 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \n \n \nIn August 2000, Applicant committed his most recent offense. At that time, he \nattempted to sexually assault two minors, and exposed his genitals to them. In August \n2000, he was 47 years old and a mature adult. AG \u00b6 14(a) does not apply. He has \nserved his incarceration and received six years of sex-offense therapy (2000 to 2006). \nHowever, Applicant described years of sexually-deviant, criminal behavior. He \ncommitted sexual crimes on hundreds of occasions. Because of this long history of \nsexual offenses, there is still a significant possibility of recurrence and AG \u00b6 14(b) can \nonly be partially applied. However, Applicant\u2019s sexual misbehavior no longer serves as \na basis for coercion, exploitation or duress because police and security officials are well \naware of his conviction for attempted sexual abuse of two children. AG \u00b6 14(c) applies \nto mitigate AG \u00b6 13(c). Over the last 25 years, he repeatedly viewed women in dressing \nrooms and their bedrooms without their consent and he exposed his genitals to adults \nand children. The minors and adults subjected to his exposure of his genitals did not \nconsent to his sexually-deviant, criminal activity and these offenses likely occurred in \npublic areas, such as an elementary school parking lot. AG \u00b6 14(d) does not apply. \n \nCriminal Conduct, Guideline J \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes six conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; \n \n(b) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces under dishonorable \nconditions;  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; \n \n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation; \n \n(e) violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated \nrehabilitation program; and \n \n(f) conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a \ncrime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and \nincarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than a year.  \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c) apply. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(b), 31(d), 31(e), and 31(f) do not apply. \nApplicant committed numerous misdemeanor-level offenses, when he exposed himself \nto female adults and children, and when he viewed women in dressing rooms and their \nbedrooms without their consent. He admitted that he committed these offenses. He \ncompleted his probation and other court-mandated rehabilitation programs. He was \nsentenced to 60 days of imprisonment, which is substantially less than one year.  He \ncurrently only has two misdemeanor-level convictions. \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(b) and 32(c) clearly do not \napply because he admitted the offenses and no one pressured him into committing the \noffenses. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are similar and partially applicable. Applicant's last \noffense occurred in August 2000, almost nine years ago. He served his sentence to \nincarceration and paid his fines. He presented strong evidence of remorse, job training, \nand a good employment record. A lengthy period has elapsed to contemplate his poor \njudgment and to respond to therapy. The six years of therapy he received is particularly \nnoteworthy. This significant amount of therapy and counseling has had a powerful \nsalutary effect. He should understand his criminal offenses have had an adverse impact \non his lifestyle, family and career as well as on his victims. His demonstrated intent not \nto commit future crimes is encompassed in these two mitigating conditions. He \naccepted responsibility and declared his culpability. He has demonstrated significant \nprogress and improved reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment; however, more \nprogress is necessary to assure and safeguard classified information.  \n \n \nNevertheless, Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is best adjudicated under the Sexual \nBehavior Guideline. It specifically addresses his sexually-deviant behavior, including its \ncriminal nature. In contrast to this Guideline\u2019s emphasis on sexual misconduct, the \nCriminal Conduct Guideline encompasses numerous criminal offenses, such as crimes \nagainst property, crimes against persons, drug crimes, and crimes involving breaches of \nintegrity (most crimes in criminal codes are unrelated to sexual misconduct). Even \nthough his long-history of criminal conduct disqualifies him from holding a security \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nclearance, I will find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d under the Criminal Conduct Guideline to avoid \nduplicative findings.       \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance or public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guidelines D and J in my whole person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some \nwarrant additional comment. \n \nThere is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s access to classified \ninformation. He completed his probation and other court-mandated rehabilitation \nprograms. He served 37 days of imprisonment and paid his fines. He frankly and \ncandidly admitted his numerous sexually-deviant acts of criminal conduct. He admitted \nhis sexual offenses on his SF-86. He married last year and his spouse supports his \nefforts at rehabilitation. He knows the consequences of being convicted of such \noffenses. He has received six years of counseling and therapy, providing important \nmitigation of his sexual offenses. Aside from the sexual offenses at issue, his file does \nnot contain any other adverse information relating to police or judicial involvement. He \nhas never been charged with any other felonies (aside from the sexual offenses \ndiscussed previously) or any firearms or explosives offense(s). He does not have any \ncurrently pending charges. He has never been charged with any offense related to \nalcohol or drugs. There is no evidence that he has abused alcohol or drugs. There is no \nevidence of other civil court actions or financial delinquencies. Applicant contributes to \nhis company and the Department of Defense. There is no evidence at work of any \ndisciplinary problems. There is no evidence of disloyalty or that he would intentionally \nviolate national security. His character and work performance show substantial \nresponsibility, rehabilitation and mitigation.    \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nApplicant committed numerous misdemeanor-level, sexually-deviant offenses, when he \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nexposed himself to female adults and children, and when he viewed women in dressing \nrooms and their bedrooms, without their consent. He admitted that he committed these \noffenses. He attempted to sexually assault two children in a school parking lot, and he \nexposed his genitals to them. He has only been held accountable for his crimes \ncommitted in August 2000, and has not been prosecuted for his numerous previous \nsexual offenses. His sexually-deviant criminal offenses were knowledgeable, voluntary, \nand intentional. He was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct. These \noffenses show a lack of judgment and a failure to abide by the law. Such conduct raises \na serious security concern, and access to classified information is not warranted at this \ntime. I conclude he has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to his sexual \nbehavior; however, his criminal conduct is mitigated because it is better addressed \nunder the Sexual Behavior Guideline.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d8 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n \n8See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 18, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On September 28, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Joan Caton\nAnthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact: Applicant is 34 years old and is\nmarried with four children.  In 2003, Applicant purchased a home.  In 2005, Applicant purchased\na second home and moved into it with his family, intending to pay the mortgage on the first home\nwith rent from a tenant.  When the tenant fell behind on her rent, Applicant fell behind on his\nmortgage payments for both houses.  The house in which Applicant was living went through\nforeclosure, and Applicant now rents a home.  Applicant still owes over $90,000 to the holders of\nthe first and second mortgages on the second home.  Applicant sold the first home to an investor,\nwho brought the mortgage payments up to date.  The investor currently makes the mortgage\npayments, but the mortgage debt will remain in Applicant\u2019s name until the property is sold.\nApplicant testified that he is behind on current bills.  Applicant has considered filing for bankruptcy.\nApplicant\u2019s father appeared as a character witness, and a family friend described the financial\ndifficulties that Applicant experienced due to the downturn in the housing market.\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2014\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).\nIn his appeal, Applicant describes the cause of his financial circumstances and his efforts to\nimprove the situation.  To the extent that the information was not in the record below, it is new\nevidence, which the Board cannot consider on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  The submission of\nnew evidence does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-\n00184 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).\nApplicant objects to some of the Judge\u2019s statements concerning his financial situation.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s objections are based at least in part on new evidence which was not before\nthe Judge.  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings are\nbased on substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be\ndrawn from the record.  The statements are therefore sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-24013\nat 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 4, 2008).\nApplicant also contends that the Judge did not give adequate weight to his evidence of\nmitigation.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether\nthe favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement\nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2\n(May 23, 2008).\n\nApplicant requests that he be allowed time to satisfy his debts while maintaining a security\nclearance.  This request could be construed as either (a) a request for a conditional security clearance,\nor (b) an argument that the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision should not be affirmed because it will result\nin adverse financial consequences for Applicant.  Under the Directive, there is no authority for a\nHearing Office Judge or the Board to grant a conditional security clearance.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 03-08107 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2005).  Moreover, the possible effect a security clearance\ndecision could have on an applicant\u2019s economic situation is not relevant or material to whether a\nJudge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.
