Loughran \ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. The Government appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nOn appeal, the Government contends that the Judge failed to properly consider all available \nevidence, misapplied the Guideline G mitigating conditions, and misapplied Guideline I \ndisqualifying condition AG \u00b6 28(a), rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. Consistent with the following, we remand the decision to address errors in the \nJudge\u2019s Guideline I analysis. Other issues raised by the Government are not ripe for discussion at \nthis time. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nThe Judge\u2019s findings and analysis are summarized and quoted in pertinent part below. \nApplicant is in his early thirties and is a non-commissioned officer in the military. He has \nserved since 2011. He had a series of mental health, disciplinary, and criminal incidents, some of \nwhich involved alcohol. In 2014, he had a \u201cpanic attack\u201d and stabbed himself repeatedly in the \nthigh with a pen and was treated in an emergency room. In 2017, 2019, and 2021, Applicant was \ninvolved in alcohol-related incidents for which he was directed to attend military-sponsored \nalcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment programs. \nA DoD psychologist evaluated Applicant in March 2022. She reported that Applicant had \nremained sober since July 2021. The psychologist concluded that Applicant did \u201cnot meet criteria \nfor any current mental health disorders but has a history of mental health diagnoses including \nadjustment disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression\u201d dating back to 2014 or earlier. \nDecision at 3. Although the psychologist did not diagnose Applicant with an alcohol use disorder, \nshe noted that he met the criteria for mild alcohol use disorder in 2017, that ranged to severe in \n2019 and 2021. His past repeated alcohol use issues along with emotional and self-harming \nbehaviors are evidence of a material deficit in judgment, reliability, and stability. She said that \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cminimization of alcohol use and the severity of alcohol related incidents and his \navoidance of discussing self-harm behaviors until asked . . . indicate a material defect in \ntrustworthiness.\u201d Id. at 4. \nUnder Guideline I, the Judge analyzed potentially disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a), \n(b), (c), and (d). In particular, he found disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 28(a) applicable to \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cpanic attack\u201d in 2014 and stabbing himself in the thigh with a pen; however, he found \nthe remaining alcohol-related conduct was covered under Guideline G and, \u201cby definition, cannot \nbe \u2018behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness, \nnot covered under any other guideline.\u2019\u201d Id. at 10 (emphasis in original). The Judge also found \nthat Applicant\u2019s suicidal ideations, with no actual attempts, are not contemplated by AG \u00b6 28(a) \nbecause \u201c[t]houghts are not behavior.\u201d Id. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge noted that \u201cApplicant has mental-health issues in addition to his alcohol abuse \ndisorder,\u201d but ultimately held that mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a), (d), and (e) were \u201cpartially \nor completely applicable and sufficient to alleviate any psychological conditions security \nconcerns.\u201d Id. at 12. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, we consider the Government\u2019s contention that the Judge erred by not applying \ndisqualifying condition AG \u00b6 28(a) to Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related conduct and suicidal ideations. \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the decision \nto determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory \nexplanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to \nconsider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary \nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of \nopinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0184 at 5, n.3 (App. Bd. Jun. 16, 1998) (citing Motor Vehicle \nMfr. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). \nApplicant\u2019s psychological concerns long predate his alcohol consumption concerns. He \nbegan having suicidal ideations in approximately 2007 and last had such thoughts as recently as \nSeptember 2021. Tr. at 31-33. In 2014, with no apparent alcohol consumption, Applicant \nexperienced a \u201cpanic attack\u201d after receiving a Letter of Reprimand issued for smoking during \ntraining and repeatedly stabbed himself in the thigh with a pen, requiring emergency room \ntreatment. Decision at 2; Government Exhibit (GE) 3 at 2. In 2019, after consuming an unknown \namount alcohol, Applicant had an incident wherein he, feeling dissatisfied with his personal \nprogress in his career and life, became aggressive, broke a table, punched a wall, head-butted a \nsteel structure, and made suicidal comments. Decision at 2; GE 3 at 2; Tr. at 23-24. In 2021, after \nreportedly consuming two beers, Applicant\u2019s military superior realized that Applicant was under \nthe influence and indicated that he was going to take the rest of Applicant\u2019s alcohol away. Tr. at \n41-42. When the two arrived at Applicant\u2019s residence, Applicant responded by smashing the \nalcohol bottles, slamming his head into the wall, punching the wall, and repeatedly stating that his \n\u201clife was over.\u201d Decision at 3; GE 2 at 1. At hearing, the Judge appeared to acknowledge that this \nlatest incident, which occurred after Applicant purportedly consumed only two beers, presented \nmore of a mental health concern than an alcohol consumption concern: \nJUDGE: Do you think that was an alcohol-related incident or a \nmental health incident, because clearly something went wrong? \n. . . \nAPPLICANT: Your Honor, the [military] quantifies any related \nincident that a member has consumed alcohol as an alcohol-related \nincident. So, in the eyes of the [military], it was an alcohol-related \nincident. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJUDGE: I\u2019m asking in your eyes. Do you think it was caused by \nyour drinking, or by your mental health issues? Or both? Because if \nit wasn\u2019t drinking, then something\u2019s wrong. Right? Because it \nwasn\u2019t normal behavior for somebody who\u2019s not drinking. \nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir. Excuse me. Yes, Your Honor. Alcohol at the \ntime brought out negative feelings that I had internally, that I had \nunresolved trauma that I had not worked through, and the meeting I \nhad with my supervisor at the time . . . triggered an emotional \nresponse, as I felt that he was shaming me for something that I \nthought had been accepted by those around me in my leadership \nchain structure, Your Honor. [Tr. at 42-43.] \nIn March 2022, a Government-approved psychologist opined that Applicant\u2019s \u201cemotional \nlability and self-harming behavior in particular demonstrates problems with stability and \njudgment.\u201d GE 3 at 2. The psychologist noted that Applicant has previously been diagnosed with \nadjustment disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression, but did \u201cnot appear to meet \ncriteria for any current mental health disorders.\u201d GE 3 at 1. Still, the psychologist determined that \nApplicant\u2019s prognosis is guarded and concluded that, \u201c[w]hile alcohol contributes to [Applicant\u2019s] \npoor decision-making, he also has demonstrated self-harm with no indications of alcohol use,\u201d \nand that \u201c[t]here is a high possibility that outside of treatment, [Applicant] could decompensate \nsignificantly.\u201d GE 3 at 3 (emphasis added). Aside from medications to address anxiety and \ninsomnia, which are prescribed by his general practitioner, Applicant does not participate in mental \nhealth treatment. Tr. at 53-54. \nDespite the foregoing and as a result of his interpretation of disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 \n28(a), the Judge\u2019s analysis focused primarily on the alcohol-related elements of Applicant\u2019s \nconduct without fully addressing the significance of Applicant\u2019s mental health history. AG \u00b6 28(a) \ncontemplates disqualification for \u201cbehavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may indicate an \nemotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not limited to, irresponsible, violent, \nself-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or \nbizarre behaviors.\u201d For the following reasons, the Judge\u2019s failure to analyze Applicant\u2019s 2019 and \n2021 incidents and suicidal ideations under AG \u00b6 28(a) was in error.1 \n1 In arguing that the Judge erred by failing to apply AG \u00b6 28(a), the Government contends that this condition is a \n\u201ccatch-all\u201d provision for Guideline I and should be construed similarly to AG \u00b6 16(d), the Guideline E catch-all \nprovision. Appeal Brief at 15. We decline to adopt this interpretation. The language of these two disqualifying \nconditions is not only tailored to their specific Guideline but is also linguistically distinct \u2013 AG \u00b6 28(a) considers \nbehavior \u201cnot covered under any other guideline and that may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality disorder,\u201d \nwhile AG \u00b6 16(d) considers information \u201cnot explicitly covered under any other guideline.\u201d (Emphasis added). \nMoreover, the language of AG \u00b6 16(d) is inclusive in nature and provides a basis to allege information that \u201cmay not \nbe sufficient by itself for an adverse determination.\u201d As discussed further herein, the language of AG \u00b6 28(a) is \ndesigned to exclude allegations of conduct, which are otherwise fully addressed elsewhere in the Guidelines, and \nprevent unnecessary duplication. \nThe Government also argues that if AG \u00b6 28(a) was \u201climited to conduct that could not be alleged under any other \nguideline, it would effectively cease to exist.\u201d Appeal Brief at 17. As demonstrated by the Judge\u2019s appropriate \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to Apply AG \u00b6 28(a) to Alcohol-Related Incidents \nThe Judge held that AG \u00b6 28(a) could not be used as a disqualifying condition to analyze \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related incidents in 2019 and 2021 because that provision only applied to \nbehavior \u201cnot covered under any other guideline.\u201d In other words, the Judge held that, because the \n2019 and 2021 incidents had alcohol components that were addressed under Guideline G, the \nincidents were precluded from analysis under Guideline I\u2019s AG \u00b6 28(a). This narrow interpretation \nis problematic. \nThe Judge\u2019s interpretation of AG \u00b6 28(a) effectively prohibits the condition\u2019s application \nwhen an element of certain conduct can be analyzed under another Guideline, in this case \nGuideline G. There are certainly some types of conduct that fall squarely under Guideline G \nanalysis, such as plain Driving Under the Influence. But other types of conduct are multifaceted \nand not fully covered under other Guidelines, such as when an individual consumes alcohol and \nalso exhibits \u201cviolent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, \ndeceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors.\u201d \nTo highlight its potential impact, the Judge\u2019s narrow interpretation of AG \u00b6 28(a) would \nbar application of the disqualifying condition to the following incidents simply because the \nindividual had consumed alcohol beforehand: self-mutilating; attempting suicide; seeing \napparitions; running in the streets and entering the homes of strangers without permission; having \na reciprocated conversation with an inanimate object. To withhold application of AG \u00b6 28(a) to \nsuch multifaceted behaviors simply because there was an alcohol component (or some other \nelement covered by another Guideline) could result in a judge overlooking significant \npsychological concerns. Such an interpretation and related potential result would undermine the \neffectiveness of the industrial security program in protecting the national security, which the Board \nwill not abide. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-24356 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Feb. 26, 2003) (citation \nomitted). See also DISCR Case No. 87-2107 at 7 (App. Bd. Oct. 25, 1990) (In construing the \nDirective, the Board will give \u201cbroad and liberal construction in order to effectuate [its] essential \npurpose vis-\u00e0-vis protecting and safeguarding classified information.\u201d). \nTo be \u201ccovered\u201d by another Guideline, the security concerns arising from the behavior at \nissue must be fully addressed by that other Guideline. If not, then psychological security concerns \nmay go unexamined when Guideline I is not applied to that behavior, which would undermine the \neffectiveness of the industrial security program.  \nHere, Applicant\u2019s violent, self-harming, and bizarre behaviors during the 2019 and 2021 \nincidents raised security concerns about his mental stability that go beyond the concerns arising \nfrom his alcohol consumption. In her evaluation, the psychologist also raised concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s mental stability based on his mental health history. An analysis of Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior during the 2019 and 2021 incidents solely under Guideline G did not \u201ccover\u201d the \nGuideline I mental stability security concerns arising from those incidents. Those mental stability \nsecurity concerns should not go unaddressed. Based on the facts of this case, we conclude the \nJudge erred in not applying AG \u00b6 28(a) to Applicant\u2019s 2019 and 2021 incidents. \napplication of AG \u00b6 28(a) to the 2014 incident, and by our analysis of AG \u00b6 28(a) herein, this argument is without \nmerit. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to Apply AG \u00b6 28(a) to Suicidal Ideations \nThe Judge also held that Applicant\u2019s history of suicidal ideations is not disqualifying under \nAG \u00b6 28(a) because \u201cthoughts are not behaviors.\u201d Decision at 10. Without making a ruling directly \nregarding this statement, we note it is potentially problematic. Such a restrictive reading would \nrender a host of thoughts \u2013 such as homicidal ideations, delusions (hearing voices to turn over \nclassified information to a foreign adversary), bizarre beliefs (thinking one can control the weather \nwith his mind), etc. \u2013 immune from Guideline I disqualification. The potential to overlook security \nconcerns of that nature simply because they are thoughts undercuts such a narrow interpretation of \nAG \u00b6 28(a). \nHere, Applicant experienced suicidal ideations for about 14 years and also repeatedly \nengaged in self-harming behavior, which, when viewed in totality, elevated his ideations beyond \nmere \u201cthoughts.\u201d The Judge\u2019s decision to withhold application of AG \u00b6 28(a) to Applicant\u2019s history \nof recurrent suicidal ideations simply because \u201cthoughts are not behaviors\u201d resulted in him \noverlooking behaviors of potential significant psychological concern and was in error. \nConclusion \nThe Government has demonstrated error that warrants remand. Pursuant to Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.33.2, the Board remands the case to the Judge with instruction to issue a new decision, \nconsistent with the requirements of Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35, after correction of the errors identified, \nabove, and reconsideration of the record as a whole. \nOrder \nThe decision is REMANDED. \nSigned: James F.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nChristopher Snowden, Esq. \nOn January 2, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \npursuant to DoD Manual 5200.02 (Apr. 3, 2017, as amended) (DoDM 5200.02) advising Applicant \nthat her behavior and circumstances raised security concerns under Guideline I (Psychological \nConditions) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017). In an undated document, Applicant \nsubmitted a reply to the SOR. \nOn November 16, 2022, the DoD Consolidated Adjudication Services revoked Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information, and she appealed that revocation under the \nprovisions of DoDM 5200.02. On December 2, 2022, Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence \n& Security) Ronald Moultrie issued a memorandum requiring that DoD civilian or military \npersonnel whose clearance eligibility was revoked or denied between September 30, 2022, and the \ndate of that memorandum be provided the opportunity to pursue the hearing and appeal process \nset forth in DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAs a result of Secretary Moultrie\u2019s memo, Applicant was given the opportunity to receive \nthe process set forth in the Directive, and she elected that process. On March 31, 2023, after \nconducting a hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge \nLeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nOn appeal, Applicant contends that the Judge improperly applied factual findings that were \nunsupported by the record and that he failed to properly consider all available evidence and \nmisapplied the mitigating conditions, rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant serves on active duty in the military. Married and divorced twice, she has two \nminor children. She earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2018 and is working on a bachelor\u2019s degree. \nShe has submitted letters from current and former military personnel supporting reinstatement of \nher security clearance. \nApplicant has experienced trauma and difficult circumstances. These include sexual \nmolestation as a child by a relative, sexual exploitation as an adolescent, two abusive marriages, \nseparation from her children while serving in the military, a suspected sexual assault while serving \noverseas, and insensitive racial comments by a military superior.  \nWhile serving overseas in November 2018, Applicant voluntarily sought treatment for \ndepression and anxiety and was treated with psychotropic drugs. In the summer of 2019, she \nreceived nonjudicial punishment for a six-hour unauthorized absence. About that time, she was \nvoluntarily admitted for three days to a psychiatric hospital for depression. During that treatment, \nshe admitted to tying a stocking around her neck, denied it was a suicide attempt, but rather claimed \nit was a cry for help.  \n[Applicant] also disclosed . . . that she had thoughts of hanging her children so that \nshe could \u201cstop the cycle of pain.\u201d (Tr. 55-60) She attributed her depression to \nbeing away from her children for two years of overseas duty and sea duty. She was \ndiagnosed with adjustment disorder with depressed mood and major depressive \ndisorder (MDD), single episode, moderate, by history. (GX [Government Exhibit] \n5) [Decision at 3.] \nShortly thereafter, Applicant was transferred to a military medical facility in the United \nStates where she was diagnosed with MDD and placed on limited duty. In November 2019, she \nreturned to full duty and was later reassigned to another installation.  \nIn October 2020, Applicant had a confrontation with her division officer. She interpreted \nhis reference to her as the \u201celephant in the room\u201d as being racial in nature. Decision at 4, citing \nApplicant Exhibit (AX) N. During that month, Applicant was evaluated and determined to be not \npsychologically fit for duty.

She submitted a complaint with the Inspector \nGeneral that a mental health provider abused her position by retaliating against her for seeking \nassistance regarding her divorce. A month later, Applicant\u2019s squadron reported to the DoD \nConsolidation Adjudication Facility (CAF) that her security clearance was suspended.  DoD CAF \nrequested Applicant undergo a medical evaluation. \n[On July 16, 2021,] Applicant was evaluated as having MDD and suspected trauma \ndisorder secondary to childhood abuse. She was found to have a borderline \npersonality disorder that requires a substantial amount of psychotherapy and \nwillingness to commit to treatment. The evaluator observed that she does not have \ngood insight into her behaviors, indicating a poor prognosis and high likelihood \nthat she will continue to experience psychological decompensation in response to \nstressors. The evaluator concluded that her psychological condition suggested an \nimpairment in her ability to properly safeguard classified information and perform \nsensitive duties. [Decision at 4, citing GX 5, emphasis added.] \nIn September 2021, Applicant was assigned to sea duty. About a month later, her \ncommanding officer requested that she be evaluated. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress \ndisorder (PTSD), found not to be psychiatrically fit for full duty, and recommended for continued \noutpatient treatment.  In January 2022, she was referred to a physical evaluation board (PEB).  \nFollowing a physical confrontation with her sister in February 2022, Applicant locked \nherself in a bathroom and used a razor blade to make three horizontal lacerations on her wrist. The \npolice had to remove the bathroom doorknob to reach her. She was hospitalized but determined \nto be at a low risk for suicide.  \n[Applicant\u2019s] long-term risk was determined to be elevated because of her chronic \ninability to cope with psychosocial stressors. The evaluator noted, \u201csuicide risk \nlevel is not static and can change based on changes in psychosocial variables.\u201d \nApplicant was diagnosed with Other Personality Disorder (mixed narcissistic and \nborderline features), with PTSD and MDD by history. Medical personnel found no \nevidence of other clinical depression, mania, anxiety, psychosis, or other major \npsychiatric disorders.  [Decision at 5, citing GX 6 at 4, 6.] \nIn October 2022, a psychiatrist diagnosed Applicant with PTSD, MDD, and borderline \npersonality disorder. In March 2023, the PEB entered an informal finding that Applicant was unfit \nfor duty because of PTSD. She did not accept the informal finding and requested a formal PEB \nhearing.  \nSince her hospitalization in February 2022, Applicant has been compliant with her \ntreatment regimen, but her medical records do not reflect a favorable prognosis. While she has \nnot engaged recently in any violent or self-destructive behavior, she has been in a controlled \nenvironment and has not been confronted with the type of stressors that contributed to her \npsychological problems. \u201cShe presented evidence of her progress in overcoming her psychological \nconditions, but not enough to overcome the security concerns.\u201d  Decision at 10. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nApplicant\u2019s Most Recent Psychiatric Evaluation \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in his analysis of her most recent psychiatric \nevaluation. This evaluation was conducted by Dr. C in February 2023. \nFirst, Applicant notes the Judge erred in finding that this evaluation was conducted in \nFebruary 2022.  This error, however, was harmless because it did not likely affect the outcome of \nthe case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020).  \nSecond, Applicant repeatedly highlights in her brief that Dr. C rated her low on the scales \nfor depression, anxiety, and PTSD. \nDr. C\u2019s evaluation contains the following chart and \ninformation: \nRATING SCALES: \nDATE \nPHQ-9 (Depression) \nGAD7 (anxiety) \nPCL-5 (PTSD) \n10/20/21 \n4 \n15 \n69 \n12/14/21 \n27 \n21 \n76 \n1/12/22 \n14 \n-\n-\n2/8/22 \n17 \n19 \n72 \n2/24/22 \n17 \n11 \n47 \n3/17/22 \n11 \n11 \n41 \n4/29/22 \n15 \n13 \n48 \n5/13/22 \n6 \n5 \n16 \n6/14/22 \n12 \n19 \n-\n2/21/23 \n0 \n1 \n3 \nKey \n5 = Mild \n10 = Moderate \n15 = Moderate to \nSevere \n20 = Severe \n5 = Mild \n10 = Moderate \n15 = Severe \n38 + = Significant \n2/21/23 C-SSRS [Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale] = 0 [AX F at 1-2.] \nDr. C\u2019s evaluation further states that the rating scales \u201cwere all in the subclinical range which was \nconsistent with [Applicant\u2019s] conditions being resolved or in full remission.\u201d Id. at 2. However, \nthe long-term significance of these ratings was not explained. Given the fluctuation of her ratings \nover the 16-month period reported, we find no error in the Judge\u2019s reluctance to rely on that data. \nThird, Applicant argues that the Judge failed to consider Dr. C\u2019s favorable prognosis in \napplying certain mitigating conditions. Specifically, she asserts: \n[T]he month prior to her evaluation, her \u201ctherapist transitioned her to follow-up \nonly as needed.\u201d  This prognosis was never even considered by the Administrative \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge.  In fact, this prognosis doesn\u2019t even make it into the Administrative Judge\u2019s \nfindings of fact.  [Appeal Brief at 11, emphasis in original.] \n* * * \nDr. [C] opined that [Applicant] was fit to return to shore duties and that her PTSD \nand MDD were both in remission. Dr. [C] opined that [Applicant\u2019s] \u201crisk to harm \nself or others in the near future is low\u201d and that \u201cshe has the capacity to make \nmedical decisions and to seek help if her condition worsens.\u201d The Administrative \nJudge inexplicably leaves this favorable recent prognosis from his analysis.  \n[Appeal Brief at 12, underlined emphasis added.] \nWe note that Dr. C\u2019s evaluation does not contain any section or statement designated as a \n\u201cprognosis.\u201d While the Directive does not define the term \u201cprognosis,\u201d it is generally defined as \n\u201cthe prospect of recovery as anticipated from the usual course of disease or peculiarities of the \ncase.\u201d See https://merrian-webster.com/dictionary/prognosis. In other words, a prognosis is a \nprediction or forecast of the likely outcome of a medical condition by a medical professional and \noften uses descriptive terms such as \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cfair,\u201d \u201cguarded,\u201d \u201cpoor,\u201d or \u201cgrave.\u201d We do not \ninterpret the portions of Dr. C\u2019s evaluation that Applicant cites as a prognosis of the likely outcome \nof her diagnosed conditions. Said differently, Applicant has not established that the Judge erred \nin concluding that her medical records do not reflect a favorable prognosis. \nFinally, regarding Dr. C\u2019s evaluation, we note the Judge correctly found that: \n[Applicant] was diagnosed with PTSD and MDD, both in remission. \nThe \npsychiatrist opined that she was fit for duty in a shore-based environment where \nshe has close support from family and access to mental health care, but that she \nwould be a risk for recurrence of symptoms if placed in a high-stress environment \nwith limited social support. The psychiatrist recommended that she not be assigned \nto sea duty or unaccompanied overseas duty due to the risk of symptom recurrence. \n[Decision at 5.] \nThese findings support the Judge\u2019s key conclusion that, while Applicant has shown progress in \novercoming her psychological conditions, this progress is not enough to overcome the alleged \nsecurity concerns. \nAdjudicative Desk Reference (ADR) \nApplicant\u2019s brief relies upon provisions in the ADR to support her arguments. These \narguments are not persuasive. DOHA judges are required to decide cases by using the Directive \nand Adjudicative Guidelines, not the ADR. The ADR itself states that \u201cit is not U.S. Government \npolicy and may not be cited as authority for denial or revocation of access\u201d to classified \ninformation.

Relying on AG \u00b6 27, which provides, in part, that \u201c[n]o negative \ninference concerning the standards in [Guideline I] may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling\u201d (emphasis added), Applicant also argues the Judge drew an impermissible, \nnegative inference that she is \u201cstill a \u2018current problem\u2019\u201d because she is \u201cstill using counseling.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 13. These arguments are frivolous. The Judge found that, based on Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and other evidence, three disqualifying conditions were established. These are AG \u00b6 \n28(a) \u201cbehavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness . . . that may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but \nnot limited, to irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal . . . behaviors;\u201d AG \u00b6 28(b) \u201can opinion \nby a duly qualified mental health professional that the individual has a condition that may impair \njudgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness;\u201d and AG \u00b6 28(c) \u201cvoluntary or involuntary \ninpatient hospitalization[.]\u201d \nThe evidence established that Applicant engaged in suicidal gestures or attempts; that she \nhad homicidal thoughts; that her commanding officer referred her for a mental health evaluation; \nthat a licensed psychologist diagnosed her in mid-2021 with mental health conditions that suggest \nan impairment of her ability to properly safeguard classified information and opined her prognosis \nwas poor; that she was hospitalized more than once for mental health conditions; that she \napparently is not currently deployable due to her mental health conditions; and that she is going \nthrough the PEB process to determine whether she is fit to remain on active duty in the military. \nSuch evidence raises doubts about Applicant\u2019s stability, reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness.  \nThe Judge did not draw a negative inference solely because Applicant sought mental health \ncounseling. From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions of a \nsecurity concern are based on substantial evidence. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1, setting forth the \nsubstantial evidence standard. \nApplicant\u2019s remaining arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of \nthe evidence. As the Board has noted in the past, an ability to argue for a different interpretation \nof the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached \nconclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016). In short, none of Applicant\u2019s arguments are sufficient to \nrebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the \nJudge\u2019s analysis of the evidence contravened the requirements of the Directive. We find no reason \nto disturb the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant failed to meet her burden to mitigate the alleged \nsecurity concerns.  \nConclusion \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that she should \nbe granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision.  The decision is sustainable on the record.  \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDepartment of the Navy v.

    "summary": "analysis. Decision at 5, 6. On appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he used marijuana through May 2022 and after completing his SCA in April 2022. In support of his position, he reiterates that he informed the investigator that he had stopped smoking marijuana and had switched to using federally legal CBD for pain relief. This argument merits consideration as two issues arise from the Judge\u2019s finding about post-SCA marijuana use: 1) the evidence regarding this matter is conflicting and the Judge\u2019s decision should have discussed how he resolved said conflicts; and 2) there is no evidence that, even if reasonably established, Applicant\u2019s post-SCA marijuana use was done with notice of its security significance. With respect to the first issue, the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant continued to use marijuana after completing his SCA was drawn from the May 2022 interview summary, wherein the investigator recorded, generally, that Applicant \u201coccasionally uses marijuana throughout the week on as a needed basis to help with pain management.\u201d FORM Item 5 at 3.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nFebruary 6, 2023, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) (SEAD 4) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). On September 15, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge Robert E. Coacher denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For reasons stated below, we \nremand the Judge\u2019s decision. \nApplicant, 25, has worked for his federal contractor employer since March 2022. He \nsubmitted a security clearance application (SCA) in April 2022, wherein he disclosed that he began \nusing marijuana in 2015 in lieu of medication for pain relief due to a fractured vertebra and nerve \ndamage in his back, and that he continued using the drug until March 2022, the month prior. As of \nhis SCA, Applicant described his marijuana use frequency as \u201c[n]ightly or on weekends only.\u201d \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) Item 4 at 32.

Applicant responded to the SOR by admitting that he used marijuana beginning in 2015 but \naverred that he stopped using the drug in March 2022 once he understood he would be undergoing \na security clearance investigation. He further denied that he used marijuana after completing his \nSCA. With respect to the conflicting usage end date recorded by the investigator, Applicant \nexplained, \u201cI honestly thought she was asking me about the use of marijuana as for what I stated \non the [SCA].\u201d FORM Item 3. \nThe Judge found against Applicant only on the allegation concerning marijuana use \ngenerally, concluding that insufficient time had passed to mitigate the alleged security concern. \nWith respect to the concern that Applicant used marijuana after completing his SCA, the Judge \nfound that Applicant used marijuana through May 2022, but ultimately ruled in Applicant\u2019s favor \non the allegation itself because \u201cit does not create a separate disqualifying condition under the \nAGs.\u201d Decision at 4. Still, the Judge considered his finding that Applicant used marijuana after \ncompleting the April 2022 SCA to note that such use \u201ccasts doubt upon [Applicant\u2019s] current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment,\u201d and for purposes of conducting the whole-person \nanalysis. Decision at 5, 6. \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he used marijuana through May \n2022 and after completing his SCA in April 2022. In support of his position, he reiterates that he \ninformed the investigator that he had stopped smoking marijuana and had switched to using \nfederally legal CBD for pain relief. This argument merits consideration as two issues arise from \nthe Judge\u2019s finding about post-SCA marijuana use: 1) the evidence regarding this matter is \nconflicting and the Judge\u2019s decision should have discussed how he resolved said conflicts; and 2) \nthere is no evidence that, even if reasonably established, Applicant\u2019s post-SCA marijuana use was \ndone with notice of its security significance. \nWith respect to the first issue, the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant continued to use marijuana \nafter completing his SCA was drawn from the May 2022 interview summary, wherein the \ninvestigator recorded, generally, that Applicant \u201coccasionally uses marijuana throughout the week \non as a needed basis to help with pain management.\u201d FORM Item 5 at 3. Notably, the investigator \nmade no specific notation about the timing of Applicant\u2019s last marijuana use. This timing differs \nfrom that self-reported by Applicant\u2019s in his April 2022 SCA and March 2023 SOR Response, \nboth of which consistently reported that Applicant stopped using marijuana in March 2022, before \nsubmitting his SCA. \nWhen conflicts exist within the record, a judge must weigh the evidence and resolve such \nconflicts based upon a careful evaluation of factors such as the evidence\u2019s \u201ccomparative reliability, \nplausibility and ultimate truthfulness.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-06723 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2007). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, inconsistencies in record evidence can be credited to an applicant\u2019s intentional \nomission or changing reports during a clearance investigation where motive to do so is apparent. \nIn very rare situations, however, important evidentiary inconsistencies may be the result of faulty \ninterview reporting, and resolution of the inconsistencies must be done in consideration of the \nreliability of the evidence as a whole. Here, the investigator\u2019s summary contains other \ninconsistencies from the information provided by Applicant in his SCA, such as the frequency of \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use as of his clearance processing. In his April 2022 SCA, Applicant \naffirmatively stated that he used marijuana on the weekends, yet the interview summary from one \nmonth later reflected that Applicant had not used marijuana on the weekends since 2020. There is \nno apparent reason for Applicant to have provided such conflicting information between his initial \nvoluntary SCA disclosure and the subsequent interview, which lends to the possibility that the \ninterview notes were misrecorded or inaccurate. In light of the foregoing, Applicant\u2019s explanation \nfor the inconsistency and repetition of his March 2022 marijuana cessation date throughout his \nself-reported investigation materials support the credibility of his timing, and the Judge erred by \nnot explaining why he found one piece of evidence more credible than the other. \nTurning to the issue of notice, the Appeal Board has \u201clong held that applicants who use \nmarijuana after having been placed on notice of the security significance of such conduct may be \nlacking in the judgment and reliability expected of those with access to classified information.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 20-01772 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 14, 2021). We have recently clarified, however, that \nthe effective timing of such notice is fact dependent and must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. \nSee ISCR Case No. 22-02132 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2023). Here, Applicant\u2019s potential marijuana \nuse after completing his SCA is only relevant to the whole-person analysis if the evidence \nestablishes that he understood the security significance of further marijuana use after initiating the \nclearance process and that he demonstrated a disregard of the security clearance eligibility \nstandards by continuing such use. Even if the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant used marijuana after \nsubmitting his SCA represented a reasonable weighing of conflicting record evidence, there is no \nevidence in the record that Applicant understood such post-SCA use to be problematic at the time \nand therefore should not have been considered under the Whole-Person Concept. \nIn this regard, it bears noting that, while marijuana use remains prohibited under Federal \nlaw, in response to the increase in the number of state and local governments legalizing or \ndecriminalizing such use, in December 2021 the Security Executive Agent issued a Clarifying \nGuidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (SecEA \nClarifying Guidance). The Guidance instructs, among other things, that \u201cprior recreational \nmarijuana use by an individual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative,\u201d and \nreiterates the requirement that agencies utilize the Whole-Person Concept \u201cto carefully weigh a \nnumber of variables in an individual\u2019s life to determine whether that individual\u2019s behavior raises \na security concern, if at all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination.\u201d SecEA Clarifying Guidance at 2. \nConsidering the foregoing, we are unable to conclude that the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant used \nmarijuana after submitting his SCA did not likely affect the outcome of the case. Notably, the \nJudge did not reference the Guidance in conducting his analysis. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWe conclude that the best resolution of this case is to remand the case to the Judge to \ncorrect the above-identified harmful error and for further processing consistent with the Directive. \nUpon remand, a Judge is required to issue a new decision.

He has been a civilian employee of the \nmilitary since late 2021. The SOR alleged concerns stemming from Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol \nuse. Specifically, Applicant was arrested in 2010, 2017, and 2018 for charges including \nDischarging a Weapon in City Limits, Injury to Property, Possession of a Firearm While \nIntoxicated, Assault, Harassment, Crimes Against Person, Making a False Report, Trespassing, \nBurglary, and public order crimes, all of which occurred while he was intoxicated. Additionally, \nApplicant was terminated from his employment as a defense contractor in 2017 following an \nincident that also occurred while he was intoxicated. In consideration of the foregoing and in \nconjunction with his request for security clearance, Applicant participated in a mental health \nevaluation in July 2022. The evaluating psychologist opined that, based on discrepancies between \nhis self-reporting and available records, Applicant was not candid with information regarding his \nalcohol use history. Applicant\u2019s medical records reflected a history of alcohol use and \npsychological issues, including suicidal ideations and behaviors, and diagnoses of Alcohol Use \nDisorders and Depressive Disorder. When questioned about the inconsistencies, the psychologist \nfound that Applicant provided insufficient information to clarify or explain the discrepancies and \ndownplayed the significance of past events. \nThe Judge held that the record clearly evinced \u201cApplicant\u2019s succession of abusive drinking \nincidents in 2017 and 2018\u201d and lacked any corroborating support for his claims to have abstained \nfrom alcohol since 2020. Decision at 10. Moreover, the record contained insufficient evidence \nregarding Applicant\u2019s pre-2017 drinking practices to assess his risks of recurrence. The Judge \nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s track record of alcohol-related incidents creates continuing security \nconcerns over risks of recurrence, which remain despite Applicant being \u201ccredited with continuing \nsobriety by his own substance abuse counselor and the director of his church support group.\u201d Id. \nAdditionally, the lack of favorable mental health evidence, such as an updated diagnosis and \nprognosis or documented follow-up counseling with a credentialed mental health professional, \nweakened Applicant\u2019s claims of improvement. The Judge found against Applicant on all \nallegations and, for the reasons stated below, we affirm. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant largely reiterates the same arguments and explanations he already \noffered regarding his criminal charges, alcohol consumption, and mental health evaluation. For \nexample, he argues that the 2022 mental health evaluation included incorrect information, namely \nthat Applicant had a \u201chistory of recurrent suicidal ideations [and] suicidal behaviors.\u201d Government \nExhibit 3 at 1. The psychologist relied on Applicant\u2019s Veterans Affairs treatment records to reach \nthis finding for the evaluation. Id. Applicant avers, however, that the only incident that could be \ninterpreted as a suicidal gesture occurred in 2011, that he discussed that lone incident with the \npsychologist, and that he has never otherwise expressed or acted on an intention to commit suicide. \nApplicant previously addressed this disagreement with the psychologist\u2019s finding in his response \nto the SOR and again at hearing. See Tr. at 31-33. There is a presumption that the Judge considered \nall of the record evidence, which would include Applicant\u2019s rebuttal to the psychologist\u2019s finding, \nand Applicant\u2019s belief that the Judge should have weighed the evidence differently is not sufficient \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto overcome or rebut that presumption on appeal. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-01642, 2002 WL \n32114497 at *3 (App. Bd. Jun. 14, 2002). \nApplicant next challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he failed to corroborate his sobriety. \nAppeal Brief at 2. The Judge found that, \u201cWith two years of claimed sobriety (inclusive of the \nthree months he has been enrolled in his church group), [Applicant] asked for simple reliance on \nhis word that he has maintained his sobriety sans any corroborating support.\u201d Decision at 6. \nContrary to Applicant\u2019s argument, the Judge acknowledged his participation in a ministry support \ngroup beginning in late 2022 but found the record evidence lacking to corroborate Applicant\u2019s \npurported sobriety dating back to 2020. Applicant\u2019s argument in this regard amounts again to a \ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of evidence, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that \nthe Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, \nor contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, and the record \nevidence supports that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe general standard \nis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nOn July 11, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \npursuant to DoD Manual 5200.02 (Apr. 3, 2017, as amended) (DoDM 5200.02) advising Applicant \nthat his conduct raised security concerns under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) and Guideline J \n(Criminal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective Jun. 8, 2017) (SEAD 4). On September 9, 2022, \nApplicant answered the SOR. \nOn October 26, 2022, DoD Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) revoked \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, and he appealed that revocation under the provisions of \nDoDM 5200.02. On December 2, 2022, Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence & Security) \nRonald Moultrie issued a memorandum requiring that DoD civilian or military personnel whose \nclearance eligibility was revoked or denied between September 30, 2022, and the date of that \nmemorandum be provided the opportunity to pursue the hearing and appeal process set forth in \nDoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). In accordance with Secretary \nMoultrie\u2019s memo, Applicant was given that option, and he elected the adjudication process in the \nDirective.

Applicant responded to those allegations on March 9, 2023.  At \na hearing session held on April 5, 2023, the Government moved to add two new Guideline E \nallegations, and that motion was granted. On April 26, 2023, the hearing reconvened to provide \nApplicant the opportunity to submit evidence regarding those new SOR allegations. \nOn May 31, 2023, after close of the record, DOHA Administrative Judge Robert E. \nCoacher denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. Consistent with the following, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nThe Decision: The Judge\u2019s pertinent findings of fact and conclusions are summarized or \nquoted below. \nApplicant, who is in his fifties, is a civilian employee of a defense agency. For many years, \nhe has worked as a security manager or personnel security specialist for Federal entities. He served \nin the miliary for about ten years and received an honorable discharge in 1999. He has a 100% \ndisability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs due to injures incurred while serving in \nAfghanistan. He holds multiple degrees, including a master\u2019s degree. He has held a security \nclearance since 1992. \nApplicant is twice divorced. The Guideline D and J allegations involve stepdaughters from \neach marriage. One stepdaughter (SD1) is from his first marriage (1993-2012) and the other (SD2) \nis from his second marriage (2014-2017). \nDuring an interview with a criminal investigator in 2017, SD2 detailed alleged sexual \nmisconduct committed by Applicant, including that he touched her genitalia to examine her for \nbody piercings, that over a four-year period he spanked her on the buttocks with a belt and his \nhands while she was naked, and that he digitally penetrated her vagina under the guise of checking \nto see if she was a virgin. Following SD2\u2019s allegations, Applicant was issued protective orders, \nreassigned, and barred from an overseas military base. \nDuring the hearing testimony, Applicant admitted that he checked SD2 for body \npiercings, but denied that he touched her vagina while doing so. He claimed that \nhe was concerned about her health. He states that she was topless and in her panties \nduring this viewing. He had her lay down and he claimed: \u201cI grabbed the top of \nher panties and I just looked at it and that was it.\u201d He admitted telling his boss, Mr. \nC, that he viewed her genital area.  [Decision at 4.] \nIn March 2018, SD1 also accused Applicant of sexual abuse, which allegedly occurred \nbetween 2003 and 2008. Applicant was subsequently indicted for conduct stemming from these \nallegations and arrested. Applicant was released from custody on bond and is required to wear an \nankle monitor.  His trial on the criminal charges is scheduled for later this year.  \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe original SOR was in a narrative format. At hearing, the Judge requested that \nDepartment Counsel state the specific allegations in the original SOR so that he could make precise \nfindings of fact, which she did both on the record and in writing. See Hearing Exhibit V. \nThereafter, the Judge noted: \nUnder Guideline D, [the SOR] alleged that in or around November 2016 and April \n2017, while stationed at an overseas military location (ML-1), Applicant engaged \nin criminal sexual behavior when he sexually abused and/or made sexually abusive \ncontacts with his stepdaughter (SD2) (SOR 1.a). Under Guideline J, it is alleged \nthat Applicant was arrested and indicted on October 14, 2021, in U.S. District Court \non two counts of engaging or attempting to engage in sexual contact with SD1 and \nSD2 (SOR 2.a); the original indictment was voided by a superseding indictment \nfiled on June 9, 2022. The superseding indictment charged Applicant with four \ncounts of sexual contacts or sexual acts against SD2 at ML-1 and against SD1 \n(when she was between the ages of 12 and 16, while residing at an overseas military \nlocation (ML-2) (SOR 2.b).  [Decision at 3.] \nThe Judge found against Applicant on the Guideline D and J allegations. In his Guideline \nD analysis, the Judge stated: \nApplicant denied the allegations. His denials are not credible in light of his \nadmissions of looking at his 18-year-old stepdaughter\u2019s vaginal area to see if she \nhad a piercing, his admission that he queried her on her virginity, and his admission \nthat he used corporal punishment on SD2 by spanking her with her pants and \nunderwear pulled down. I did not find his explanation about why he engaged in \nthese actions with SD2 rather than her mother, W2, credible.  [Decision at 10.] \nThe SOR, as twice amended, also alleges nine security clearance application (SCA) \nfalsifications under Guideline E. These asserted that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose \nunfavorable employment information in response to questions on SCAs submitted in 2011, 2013, \nand 2019. Applicant denied these allegations. The Judge found against Applicant on all but one \nof the Guideline E allegations, noting, \u201c[w]ith this background [as a personnel security specialist], \nhe was fully aware of his responsibilities to provide truthful, non-misleading information when \nanswering questions about his previous work experiences.\u201d  Decision at 12. \nAppeal Issues \nThere is no presumption of error below. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.19-01689 at 3 (App. Bd. \nJun. 8, 2020). The appealing party has the burden of raising and establishing that the Judge \ncommitted harmful factual or legal error. Id. In his appeal brief, Applicant raises due process \nissues and challenges some of the Judge\u2019s conclusions. \nElection of Security Clearance Adjudication under the Directive \nOn appeal, Applicant first raises related due process issues regarding his adjudication \nelection under Secretary Moultrie\u2019s memo. He contends that the DOHA hearing and appeal \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nprocess under the Directive \u201cwas not thoroughly explained\u201d to him and also asserts that he was \n\u201cgiven no opportunity to utilize [his] agency\u2019s security management office (SMO) for guidance\u201d \nunder the Directive\u2019s process. Appeal Brief at 1-2. He further states that he regrets electing the \nDOHA hearing and appeal process.  Id. at 1. We find no merit in these assertions. \nApplicant is raising these issues for the first time on appeal.1 His contentions are refuted \nby the record and the Government\u2019s Reply Brief, which include the following: \na. The Reply Brief contains documents showing that Applicant was provided adequate \ninformation about the adjudication processes. 2 These include (1) a DOHA document dated \nFebruary 10, 2023, explaining the difference between the DoDM 5200.02 appeal process and the \nDirective hearing and appeal process, and (2) the disclosure letter sent to Applicant on February \n23, 2023, providing information about the Directive hearing process and copies of the exhibits the \nGovernment intended to offer into evidence at the hearing. \nb. In his adjudication process election, Applicant stated: \nOf the options that were provided to me on February 10, 2023, I would like to select \nthe process under the 5220.6 process. Your memorandum states that this process \nprovided an opportunity for a hearing prior to denial or revocation of a clearance. \nPrior to the hearing you would be provided with a copy of any evidence that an \nattorney representing the Government planned to present to the Administrative \nJudge at the hearing. The hearing is conducted in the same manner under either \nprocess [i.e., compared to a personal appearance under DoDM 5200.02], however \nunder the 5220.6 process the Administrative Judge would issue a decision which is \nfinal unless appealed to DOHA\u2019s independent three-judge Appeal Board by the \nlosing party, be that the Government or you. \nI would like the process under DoD 5220.6. [Hearing Exhibit IV.] \nThis election reflects that Applicant had a good understanding of the hearing and appeal process \nunder the Directive and of the major difference between the two DoD hearing processes. \nc. Prior to the hearing, Applicant was sent a Notice of Hearing that scheduled the \nproceeding. The notice contained two documents issued by the DOHA Chief Judge, i.e., (1) a \nmemorandum, dated January 10, 2023, explaining the options provided in Secretary Moultrie\u2019s \nmemo, and (2) the Prehearing Guidance for DOHA Industrial Security Clearance (ISCR) Hearings \n1 Although there is a sufficient basis to conclude that Applicant forfeited or waived some issues by failing raise them \nin a timely manner in the proceeding below, we will address those issues. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-23356 at 7, \nn. 11 (App. Bd. Nov. 24, 2003) (issues may be waived even though the Directive does not address waivers) and DISCR \nOSD Case No. 88-1198 at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 1992) (waiver of objection to a motion to amend the SOR by failing \nto raise it at the hearing). \n2 The Appeal Board is generally prohibited from considering new evidence. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. The Board, however, \ncan consider new evidence when examining threshold issues, such as jurisdiction and due process. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 14-00812 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 8, 2015). In this case, we can consider the documents attached to the \nGovernment\u2019s Reply Brief because they pertain to due process issues that Applicant raises on appeal. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nand Trustworthiness (ADP) Hearings, dated January 15, 2019. This latter three-page document \ndetailed the basic hearing procedures and directed applicants or their representatives to consult the \nDirective for further guidance. In the Government\u2019s disclosure letter, Applicant was provided a \ncopy of the Directive. Furthermore, because Applicant has worked as a personnel security \nspecialist for many years, including at DOHA for a period (Decision at 2), it would not have been \nunreasonable for the Judge to conclude that Applicant was familiar with the Directive and the \nadjudicative guidelines. \nd. At the beginning of the hearing, the Judge asked Applicant whether he understood \u201cthat \nunder the Directive [he had] the right to be represented by an attorney or personal representative \nat [his] own expense[.]\u201d Tr. at 7. Applicant responded in the affirmative. Id. Regarding \nApplicant\u2019s assertion that he was not given the opportunity to consult with his agency\u2019s security \noffice, we note that no provision in the Directive restricts him from seeking assistance from his \nsecurity office in preparing for the hearing. Nor has he cited anything that either Department \nCounsel or the Judge may have said that would have caused him to believe he was prohibited from \nconsulting with his security office before the hearing.   \ne. At the beginning of the hearing, the Judge also explained the basic hearing procedures \nand process.  Tr. at 6-30. The Judge further stated: \nDuring these proceedings, unless you indicate otherwise, I will assume you \nunderstand what\u2019s happening and don\u2019t have any questions or concerns.  If you do \nhave any questions at any time, just let me know and we\u2019ll address them at that \ntime.  [Tr. at 8.] \nAt the hearing, Applicant did not raise any questions or concerns of that nature. While the Judge \ndid stop Applicant at times, such as during his opening statement to tell him that certain matters \nbeing raised were not relevant or that he was repeating himself (see, e.g., Tr. at 40, 42), none of \nthose stoppages would have led a reasonable person to conclude that Applicant\u2019s understanding of \npertinent matters was so deficient that he was not capable of representing himself in this \nadministrative proceeding. \nBased on our review, we conclude that Applicant was provided timely and adequate \ninformation about the DOHA hearing and appeal process and that he knowingly elected to have \nhis case adjudicated under that process. His assertion that the process was not thoroughly \nexplained to him fails to establish that he was denied any due process rights afforded him under \nthe Directive. Furthermore, the fact that Applicant is dissatisfied with the Judge\u2019s decision and \nnow regrets his election of a clearance adjudication under the Directive is not a legitimate basis \nfor vacating that election or for granting him any relief on appeal. \nSOR Amendments \nApplicant asserts that the Government amended the SOR without consulting with his \nagency or the CAS.

The [original] SOR details \nwere laid out to me on July 11, 2022, and I was given 60 days to respond at that \ntime to the SOR, the [second] amended SOR provided me 21. Two separate sets \nof amendments were granted by AJ Coacher and I was not given an adequate \namount of time to submit a detailed and proper response therefore I responded \npoorly due to the time constraints placed upon me by the Administrative Judge . . . \nbetween hearings.  [Appeal Brief at 2-3.] \nTo the extent that Applicant is contending that an error occurred by amending the SOR \nwithout consulting the CAS or his agency, this argument lacks merit. Applicant cites no authority \nsupporting this contention. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.17 addresses a motion to amend the SOR at the \nhearing and provides: \nThe SOR may be amended at the hearing by the Administrative Judge on his or her \nown motion, or upon motion by Department Counsel or the applicant, so as to \nrender it in conformity with the evidence admitted or for other good cause. When \nsuch amendments are made, the Administrative Judge may grant either party\u2019s \nrequest for such additional time as the Administrative Judge may deem appropriate \nfor further preparation or other good cause. \nThere is no Directive provision that addresses amending the SOR prior to the hearing. Whether \nSORs are amended before or during the hearings, there is no requirement for the Government or \nthe Judge to consult with the CAS or an applicant\u2019s employer before or after such an amendment. \nSuch a consultation with an employer in an industrial case would likely result in a Privacy Act \nviolation. We also note that Section 10 (Appeal Process) of DoDM 5200.02 does not address SOR \namendments in personal appearances. In short, no procedural error occurred by not consulting \nwith Applicant\u2019s agency or the CAS about the SOR amendments. \nSeventy-one days passed between the issuance of the first SOR amendment and the \ncommencement of the hearing and 21 days transpired between the second SOR amendment and \nthe reconvening of the hearing. At the first session of the hearing, the Judge granted the \nGovernment\u2019s motion permitting the second SOR amendment and, sua sponte, indicated that he \nintended to give Applicant 15 days to further prepare regarding that amendment (Tr. at 156), which \nalso happens to be the minimum period an applicant is entitled between receiving the notice of \nhearing and the commencement of a hearing. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8. Applicant responded that \nhe would take the 15 days and did not indicate that he needed more time to prepare. Tr. at 156\u00ad\n159. However, shortly thereafter, the Judge decided to reconvene the hearing 21 days later, which \nalso happens to be one day more than the period an applicant is entitled in responding to an original \nSOR following its receipt. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.4. Applicant asserted no objection to reconvening \nthe hearing on that proposed date.  When the hearing reconvened, Applicant did not assert that he \nwas unprepared or that he needed additional time to prepare. At the second hearing session, \nApplicant testified and offered additional exhibits.  His appeal brief does not assert that, if he had \nbeen giving additional time, he would have proceeded in any different manner. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \nApplicant failed to establish that he requested additional time to prepare either prior to or \nat the hearing. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.17 does not specify the length of time that an applicant must be \ngiven to prepare after the SOR is amended. In the absence of a specified period, the Judge\u2019s \ndetermination regarding how much time an applicant should be given to prepare is reviewed under \nthe abuse of discretion standard. In this case, we find no reason to conclude the Judge abused his \ndiscretion in providing Applicant 21 days following the second amendment. In short, Applicant \nfailed to establish that he did not receive fair notice of, and a reasonable opportunity to respond to, \nthe SOR amendments. \nPending Criminal Charges \nApplicant\u2019s brief states: \nWith regards to the SOR issued on July 11, 2022; my criminal defense attorney \nprovided me with specific responses to the SOR. Under my attorney\u2019s advice, I \nwas to respond to each allegation in written form before the request for a hearing. \nEssentially, \u201cNO COMMENT\u201d was the response to the allegations until after the \ntrial which is scheduled to be held [later this year]. During the DOHA hearings, AJ \nCoacher did not object to the government attorneys questioning me again regarding \nthe July 11, 2022, SOR.  The government attorneys continued to ask the questions \nthat were laid out on the written SOR in the hopes of getting a different answer after \nthey were fully aware of the fact my initial responses were: \u201cI contest these \nallegations, and I have pled \u201cnot guilty\u201d to them, and legally I am innocent of these \nallegations, however, given the ongoing nature of the litigation, I have been advised \nby counsel not to specifically detail all the reasons the alleged victim\u2019s statements \nare untrustworthy and factually inaccurate.\u201d [Appeal Brief at 3, quoting SOR \nResponse.] \nApplicant further stated that he was placed in an awkward position about what he could and could \nnot say about the SOR allegations. To the extent that he is contending that his right to remain \nsilent was infringed, we do not find that argument persuasive. Regarding this issue, we first note \nthat Applicant\u2019s comments about the advice he received from the attorney representing him in the \ncriminal proceeding constitutes new evidence that the Appeal Board cannot consider.  Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.29. \nApplicants may exercise their right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment \nof the U.S. Constitution when responding to SOR allegations or questions that call for answers \nthat might expose them to potential criminal prosecution. See, e.g., DISCR OSD Case No. 90\u00ad\n0721 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 1992) (noting Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination can \nbe invoked in industrial security clearance cases).3 As an initial matter, Applicant did not ever \n3 Directive \u00b6 6.1 also provides: \nAn applicant is required to give, and to authorize others to give, full, frank, and truthful answers to \nrelevant and material questions needed by the DOHA to reach a clearance decision and to otherwise \ncomply with the procedures authorized by this Directive. The applicant may elect on constitutional \nor other grounds not to comply; but refusal or failure to furnish or authorize the providing of relevant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n \n \nexplicitly exercise his right against self-incrimination. At no time before or during the hearing did \nhe object to a question or refuse to respond because the response could potentially incriminate him. \nHis statement in the SOR Response that he was told by his \u201ccounsel not to specifically detail all \nthe reasons the alleged victim\u2019s statements are untrustworthy and factually inaccurate\u201d was not \nraised as a Fifth Amendment privilege issue at the hearing. Since Applicant was representing \nhimself in this proceeding, it was his responsibility, not the Judge or Department Counsel, to \nprotect and invoke his rights. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02196 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 27, 2018) \n(although pro se applicants cannot be expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely, \nreasonable steps to protect their rights) and ADP Case No. 18-00329 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2018) \n(Judges and Department Counsel have no authority to provide advice to applicants concerning \nwhat rights they should exercise). Applicant has not established that his right against self-\nincrimination was infringed during the processing of his case. \nAdditionally, Applicant contends that, even though the criminal charges against him are \nstill pending, Department Counsel and the Judge \u201chave already deemed the case against me as \nvalid, and guilt is assumed in the ruling on this matter.\u201d Appeal Brief at 3. This argument lacks \nmerit. DOHA proceedings and criminal trials are very different. Of note, DOHA proceedings \napply a much lower standard of proof (substantial evidence) than criminal trials (beyond a \nreasonable doubt). See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1, setting forth the substantial evidence standard. In \nDOHA proceedings, a Judge can make findings that an applicant engaged in criminal conduct even \nif the applicant has not been charged with or convicted of that criminal conduct or even if the \napplicant has been acquitted of that criminal conduct. A disqualifying condition that applies in \nthis case highlights this point. Under Disqualifying Condition 13(a), a security concern could arise \nfrom \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 13(a) (emphasis added). In this case, the Judge\u2019s determination that Applicant committed \nthe alleged offenses is merely an administrative conclusion that substantial evidence exists in the \nrecord to establish Applicant engaged in security-significant conduct. Applicant failed to establish \nthat the Judge acted beyond the authority provided him in the Directive when he concluded \nApplicant engaged in the alleged sexual/criminal conduct. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02018 at \n4 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2021). \nApplicant further requests that his security clearance revocation be suspended until after \nthe criminal proceedings and that he be given an appropriate amount of time to respond to the \namended SOR. Appeal Brief at 4. Applicant is essentially requesting that the proceeding be \ndelayed so that he can develop additional evidence. The Board has no authority to grant that \nrequest. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 12, 2014) (an applicant is not \nentitled to a delayed or deferred adjudication and the Board has no authority to grant an applicant \nan extension for the purpose obtaining more evidence). Furthermore, Applicant has not established \nthat he merits the granting of any exception under Appendix C of SEAD 4. \nand material information or otherwise cooperate at, any stage in the investigation or adjudicative \nprocess may prevent the DOHA from making a clearance decision. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nImpact of Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) Settlement Agreement on Falsification \nAllegations \nSeven of the nine falsification allegations concern Applicant\u2019s responses to questions in \n2011 and 2013 SCAs. These responses involve a position that Applicant held at a Federal agency \nfrom 2009 to 2011. More specifically, the questions asked the reason why Applicant left that \nposition; whether he had been fired, quit, or left a position by mutual agreement following charges \nor misconduct in the last seven years; and whether he had been officially reprimanded, suspended, \nor disciplined for workplace misconduct in the last seven years. Applicant indicated that he left \nthe position at issue for \u201c[c]areer progression to a position at a federal government agency in law \nenforcement\u201d and answered \u201cNo\u201d to the other questions. See Government Exhibit (GE) 2 at 15; \nGE 3 at 23. The Judge concluded that Applicant \u201cdeliberately provided false and misleading \ninformation\u201d in his response to those questions.  Decision at 11. \nApplicant basically challenges the Judge\u2019s adverse findings on those seven falsification \nallegations because they contravene a MSPB settlement agreement. He contends, \u201cI did not \nknowingly lie or falsify any government documentation ever in my career and under the agreement \nof the MSPB settlement between [the former agency] and myself, the agency was to remove \nanything that alleged misconduct.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 3. \nIn the decision, the Judge addressed the MSPB settlement agreement by finding: \nApplicant was issued a removal letter for misconduct by his agency on January 6, \n2011. Applicant contested this action before [MSPB]. On May 9, 2011, Applicant \nand the agency entered into a settlement agreement accepted by the MSPB. As part \nof the agreement, the agency rescinded the actions removing Applicant from \nemployment for cause and Applicant agreed to resign from his position, effective \nin August 2011. \nOther than requiring the agency to remove the removal \ndocumentation from Applicant\u2019s official personnel records, the agreement had no \neffect on his two prior disciplinary suspensions. Applicant also agreed never to \napply to the agency for future employment. [Decision at 7.] \nIn his analysis, the Judge concluded, \u201cThe MSPB settlement agreement between the agency and \nApplicant had no bearing on his responsibility to provide accurate information on his SCAs.\u201d \nDecision at 12.4 \n4 The Government argues that the Appeal Board previously addressed this issue and affirmed an adverse falsification \nfinding that involved an applicant who had a settlement agreement expunging the record of an employment \ntermination. Reply Brief at 23 (citing ISCR Case No. 11-07487 at 6-7 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2018)). The facts in that \ncase, however, are distinguishable from the present case; particularly, other evidence existed to support a finding that \nthe applicant intended to conceal information about his employment. The Government also argues that the MSPB \nsettlement agreement \u201cis akin to a conviction being expunged, but the reporting requirements on the SF-86 still require \nit to be identified.\u201d Reply Brief at 23, n. 101. We do not find that argument persuasive. Unlike the questions regarding \nemployment disciplinary actions and removals, the SCA questions regarding an applicant\u2019s police record are \nspecifically prefaced with an instruction to report information regardless of whether the record has been sealed, \nexpunged, or otherwise stricken from the court record, or the charge was dismissed. See, e.g., GE 1 at 51. Conversely, \nthe SCAs in this case have no similar instruction with respect to employment history and do not require the reporting \nof adverse employment actions even if they have been subsequently rescinded by settlement agreement. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPertinent provisions of the MSPB settlement agreement state: \n(1) \u201cThe Agency agrees to rescind the Decision to Remove for misconduct dated 6 January \n2011 with an effective dated of 7 January 2011, and cancel the applicable SF-50 documenting his \nremoval. Neither the issued decision nor cancelled SF 50 will remain in [Applicant\u2019s] Official \nPersonnel File (OPF). Any other documents in [Applicant\u2019s] OPF will be removed reflecting \nthe subject misconduct.\u201d Applicant Exhibit A1 at \u00b6 2 (emphasis added). \n(2) \u201c[Applicant] will sign an SF-52, Request for Personnel Action, documenting his \nresignation effective ninety (90) calendar days after the signing of this agreement.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 5. \n(3) \u201cThe Agency agrees to accept [Applicant\u2019s] resignation effective on 7 August 2011 and \nissue an SF-50 documenting Resignation \u2013 for personal reasons. The SF-50 documenting \nResignation \u2013 for personal reasons will be filed in [Applicant\u2019s] Official Personnel Folder.\u201d Id. at \n\u00b6 9 (emphasis added). \nBased on our reading of the MSPB settlement agreement, the Judge erred in concluding \nthat the MSPB settlement agreement had no bearing on Applicant\u2019s SCA responses. Additionally, \nsince the rescinded Decision to Remove for Misconduct\u2e3awhich would have likely reflected the \nmisconduct at issue\u2e3ais not in the record, it is unknown whether the 2-day and 14-day disciplinary \nsuspensions fell within the scope of the settlement agreement and were removed from Applicant\u2019s \nOPF. \nIn adjudicating falsification allegations, an applicant\u2019s state of mind is often the principal \nissue. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-03939 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 21, 2023). See also ISCR Case No. \n02-11286 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2004) (an SCA omission, standing alone, is not proof of a \ndeliberate falsification); ISCR Case No. 05-03472 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 12, 2007) (the Judge must \nmake findings about Applicant\u2019s culpable state of mind that are reasonably supported by the record \nevidence for an adverse falsification finding to be sustainable). The provisions in the MSPB \nsettlement agreement that provided for the deletion of the removal action and disciplinary actions \nfrom Applicant\u2019s OPF and that characterized his departure from the agency as a \u201cresignation for \npersonal reasons\u201d were significant matters that merited examination. Applicant\u2019s understanding \nof the agreement was a key factor to consider in determining whether he deliberately falsified the \nSCA responses. From our review, we conclude that the Judge erred in failing to analyze the impact \nthe above-quoted agreement provisions may have had on Applicant\u2019s state of mind when he \nresponded to those questions. This error, however, was harmless. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19\u00ad\n01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020) (an error is harmless if it did not affect the outcome of the case). \nBased on our review, the Judge\u2019s adverse finding on one of the two remaining falsification \nallegations is sustainable. Moreover, considering the record in its entirety, the sustainable adverse \nfindings under Guidelines D, J, and E sufficiently support the unfavorable clearance decision. \nApplicant also requests that \u201ca thorough inquiry be conducted to confirm or deny that \nderogatory information was reported in JPAS and to the CAF during this period . . . [and] that the \nagency . . . complied with the terms of the MSPB Settlement Agreement.\u201d Appeal Brief at 3.

On March 23, 2023, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of \nthe basis for that decision\u2015trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement \nand Substance Misuse) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) \nand DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a \ndecision on the written record. On September 29, 2023, after considering the record, Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Matthew E. Malone denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For reasons stated below, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana from about 1991 to \nFebruary 2023; that he purchased marijuana from about 2015 to September 2022; that he used \nVicodin in about 2010 without a prescription; that he was arrested for possession of a narcotic \ncontrolled substance in about 2010; that he was required to obtain drug treatment in about 2009 \nbut did not complete it; that he used methamphetamine in about 1994 and from about 2000 to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2007; that he was charged with possession of, and being under the influence of, a controlled \nsubstance in about 2007; that he was charged with possession of a controlled substance for sale in \n1998; that he sold cocaine from about 1993 to 1996; and that he was charged with sale or \ntransportation of a controlled substance and possession of methamphetamine in about 1994. Under \nGuideline E, the SOR cross-alleged the Guideline H allegations and also alleged that Applicant \nfalsified responses on his 2022 security clearance application (SCA) by deliberately failing to \ndisclose the above drug charges against him and by deliberately failing to disclose his marijuana \nuse within the preceding seven years. In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the \nSOR allegations except for the Guideline E allegation cross alleging the Guideline H allegations, \nwhich he neither admitted nor denied. The Judge found in favor of Applicant on two SOR \nallegations (the 1998 charge pertaining to possession of a controlled substance for sale and the \nGuideline E allegation cross alleging the Guideline H allegations) and found against him on the \nother allegations. \nRegarding the SCA falsification allegation pertaining to his failure to disclose his \nmarijuana use during the preceding seven years, Applicant contends on appeal that his answer to \nthat question \u201cwas contingent upon the fact that I had not been in trouble for any drug-related \nactivities within the 7-year timeframe.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. To the extent that he is now claiming \nthat he did not deliberately falsify the response because he misunderstood the question, he has \nfailed to establish that the Judge committed any error. When Applicant responded to the SOR, he \nadmitted this falsification allegation without providing any explanatory comments. His admission \nestablished that falsification allegation. The record contains no evidence that would have brought \nto the Judge\u2019s attention that Applicant may have misunderstood that question. By raising this issue \non appeal, Applicant is making a claim that constitutes new evidence, which the Appeal Board is \nprohibited from receiving or considering. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. We resolve this issue adversely to \nApplicant. \nIn his brief, Applicant further asserts that he was a voluntary participant in the 2009 drug \ntreatment program. To the extent that he is contending that the Judge erred in finding a local child \nprotective service (CPS) agency ordered him to undergo that treatment, we conclude the Judge \ncommitted no error. Applicant\u2019s background interview reflects that the CPS agency required him \nto receive that treatment. In responding to interrogatories, Applicant indicated the summary of his \ninterview was accurate. File of Relevant Material, Item 3 at 3. The record evidence supports the \nchallenged finding. \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s \nweighing of the evidence; however, none of his arguments are sufficient to establish the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.32.3 \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he should \nbe granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on the record.

On October 5, 2023, after \nthe record closed, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge John Bayard \nGlendon denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged 13 delinquent debts that totaled approximately $62,000. The Judge found \nfavorably for Applicant on 10 smaller debts and adversely to Applicant on three large debts that \ntotal approximately $59,000. On appeal, Applicant asserts that the Judge erred in finding that his \ndebts raised disqualifying security concerns. \nApplicant is in his early thirties. He married in 2013 and has a minor child from that \nrelationship. Separated from his wife, Applicant and his cohabitant have recently had a child. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant has not taken any steps to divorce his wife due to the legal costs. Applicant served in \nthe military from 2009 through 2017. Following his honorable discharge, Applicant was \nunemployed for nine months before securing employment in August 2018. \nApplicant\u2019s three debts of security concern arose during his transition from active duty and \nhis separation from his wife. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a charged-off balance of approximately $36,000 \non a vehicle that Applicant voluntarily relinquished after his discharge from service, when he could \nno longer afford the monthly payments. Under the mistaken impression that returning the vehicle \nwould satisfy the debt, and despite receiving bills from the creditor following the repossession, \nApplicant became aware of the outstanding balance in 2021 during his security clearance process. \nHe last spoke to the creditor in January 2023 and has been unsuccessful in negotiating a payment \nplan. When Applicant and his wife separated, he was a co-signor on both a rental lease for their \napartment and a loan for her vehicle. His wife subsequently moved out of the apartment, breaking \nthe lease, and stopped making payments on the vehicle, which was then repossessed. Those two \ndelinquent debts are approximately $4,500 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and $17,300 (SOR \u00b6 1.h), respectively. \nApplicant acknowledges his responsibility for the two debts but is reluctant to pay them until he \nand his wife determine who is ultimately responsible. \nIn determining that these three debts are not mitigated, the Judge wrote: \nI have given significant weight to Applicant\u2019s service to the U.S. Government as a \n[servicemember] and as a government contractor. I have also given weight to the \ncharacter evidence provided by Applicant and to the difficulties raised by his \nunemployment following his military discharge. However, his inaction regarding \nhis three largest debts shows that he lacks the maturity for national security \neligibility. He is not able or willing to face the difficult task of resolving his marital \ndebts through a separation agreement or divorce. Similarly, he has not been willing \nto face the difficult task of resolving a large loan for a vehicle he voluntarily \nsurrendered. [Decision at 8.] \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of \nfact. Rather, he disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusion that his debts raise security concerns, \narguing that he has demonstrated his willingness and ability to pay his debts and a history of \nmeeting financial obligations. Applicant highlights his success at paying off the 10 alleged debts \nthat were mitigated and his ongoing efforts to address the remining three larger debts. The Judge, \nhowever, discussed the issues that Applicant now raises on appeal. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments \nare sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all the evidence in the record nor \nare they enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law.

The Judge found adversely on the \nallegations regarding Applicant\u2019s wife and mother-in-law, and favorably on the allegations \nregarding his brother- and sisters-in-law. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant, in his mid-fifties, has been married to his current wife since 2015. He served in \nthe military from 1986 until his honorable discharge in 1990 and began working for BPA in 1992. \nBetween 2006 and 2012, while working as a BPA agent, Applicant engaged in various misconduct \nthat resulted in his being removed from employment on three occasions.

In July 2019, \nApplicant was given another opportunity to cooperate with the investigation and warned that \ncontinued failure to do so would result in discontinuation of his case. In December 2019, Applicant \ncompleted an affidavit setting forth his intention to fully discuss the relevant information with the \ninvestigator; however, in January 2020, he asserted that he did not think there was any just cause \nto discuss his past terminations since he had been reinstated after each. \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a citizen and resident of Kuwait and is employed as the head of the \ndepartment for the Kuwait Ministry of Health.

In its cross-appeal, the Government argues that the Judge\u2019s Guideline B \nanalysis pertaining to Applicant\u2019s siblings-in-law was arbitrary, capricious, and not supported by \nthe record evidence.2 For reasons stated below, we affirm the Judge\u2019s ultimate adverse decision. \nGuideline E \nThe Judge concluded that the specific instances of workplace misconduct were mitigated \nthrough application of AG \u00b6 17(c).3 Noting the importance placed on cooperation with the \ninvestigative process and that the 2017 incident was not the first time Applicant refused to answer \nquestions from an investigator, the Judge concluded that, \u201cgiven the recurrent nature of this \nbehavior, . . . none of the mitigating conditions apply, and [Applicant\u2019s] refusal to cooperate \ncontinues to pose a security concern.\u201d Decision at 10. \nApplicant\u2019s arguments on appeal amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of \nthe evidence, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached \nconclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). For example, Applicant argues that the \u201crecord supports \n[his] full cooperation\u201d with the investigator in 2017 and that he \u201chas fully cooperated and complied \nwith all security clearance related investigations since 2017.\u201d App. Appeal Brief at 2, 6. In support \nof this argument, Applicant asserts that the Government conceded Applicant\u2019s cooperation with \nthe July 2017 interview when Department Counsel stated during his closing argument that \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cfirst interview [apparently referring to July, 2017] - - and he did answer some \nquestions the first time. He said he didn\u2019t want to, and then, he came back around and he did. We \nagree with that.\u201d Id. at 2 (citing Tr. at 146) (emphasized text added by Applicant). \nThe Government\u2019s closing argument does not constitute record evidence. Moreover, this \nexcerpted portion of the transcript coupled with Applicant\u2019s added commentary is grossly \nmisleading. Contrary to that commentary, the excerpt clearly does not refer to the July 2017 \ninterview. The record is clear that Applicant participated in two interviews in conjunction with his \n2017 security clearance investigation \u2013 the first on March 14, 2017, and the second on July 11, \n2017. See Government Exhibit (GE) 4 at 4, 14. Even if Applicant\u2019s chosen excerpt was the entirety \n2 Under Guideline F, the SOR also alleged that Applicant had debts discharged under Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in 2018, \nthat he failed to timely file Federal income tax returns for 2018 and 2019, and that he owed approximately $24,000 to \nthe Federal Government for unpaid income taxes. The Judge found favorably for Applicant on all Guideline F \nallegations, for which neither party raises any claim of error on appeal. \n3 AG \u00b6 17(c) \u2013 the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \ns \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof the Government\u2019s argument on the subject, there would be no question that the Government \nacknowledged Applicant\u2019s ultimate participation during the interview in March 2017 \u2013 the first \ninterview \u2013 not the interview in July 2017. \nThat being said, the excerpt chosen by Applicant does not, in fact, represent the entirety of \nthe Government\u2019s argument on the subject. Rather, our review of the transcript reveals that the \nGovernment acknowledged that, \u201c[i]was like pulling teeth, but [Applicant] answered the \nquestions\u201d during his first interview in March 2017. Tr. at 147. The Government continued to \nargue, however, that it was during the second interview in July 2017, \u201cwhere the investigator came \nup with different questions, and [Applicant] refused to answer them.\u201d Id. Applicant\u2019s \nmischaracterization of the Government\u2019s position is as troubling as it is unpersuasive. \nThe actual record evidence clearly reflects that Applicant refused to respond to the majority \nof the investigator\u2019s questions during the second interview, referred the investigator to his attorney, \nand even attempted to call his attorney. See GE 4 at 14-16. This is the interview and conduct \nalleged with specificity in the SOR. The Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant refused to provide full and \nfrank answers to questions during the July 2017 clearance interview is supported by the record and \nhis conclusion that said refusal continues to pose a security concern is reasonable in light of the \nrecord as a whole. \nGuideline B \nThe Judge\u2019s formal findings under Guideline B were split, concluding that Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with his wife and mother-in-law pose security concerns, while his relationships with \nhis brother- and sisters-in-law do not. Three of these four conclusions are challenged on appeal. \nApplicant\u2019s Appeal \nThe Judge found disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(e)4 applicable to Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with his wife, noting that Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to coercion is heightened because \nhe lives in Kuwait and his wife is a senior official of a Kuwaiti government agency, which \n\u201cgenerates a security concern too significant to overcome.\u201d Decision at 12. The Judge also \nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s relationship with his mother-in-law remains a security concern because \nthere is a rebuttable presumption that he has close ties of affection to her through his wife. \nOn appeal, Applicant does not challenge the Judge\u2019s unfavorable conclusion with respect \nto his mother-in-law. His sole challenge to the Judge\u2019s Guideline B analysis is to the conclusion \nthat Applicant\u2019s relationship with his wife poses a security concern, which appears to be based \nlargely on the facts that his wife lived in the United Kingdom for much of her childhood and \n4 AG \u00b6 7(a) \u2013 contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, \nor other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nAG \u00b6 7(e) \u2013 shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates \na heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \ns \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nobtained U.S. citizenship in August 2022, and that the U.S. and Kuwait have a positive diplomatic \nrelationship. App. Appeal Brief at 2, 5. These facts \u2013 all of which are reflected in the Judge\u2019s \ndecision (see Decision at 7, 11) \u2013 do not command a favorable finding under Guideline B. In \naddition to the facts cited by Applicant, the Judge correctly considered that Applicant\u2019s wife is a \nsenior official of a Kuwaiti government agency and that the two continue to reside in Kuwait. Here \nagain, Applicant\u2019s argument amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, \nwhich is not sufficient to establish error. The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s wife \u201cgenerates \na security concern too significant to overcome\u201d is reasonable and sustainable. Decision at 12. \nGovernment\u2019s Cross- Appeal \nThe Judge also found AG \u00b6 7(a) applicable to Applicant\u2019s two sisters-in-law because of his \ncontinued contact with them. Still, without citing any applicable mitigating condition but noting \nthat Applicant \u201cdoes not like\u201d his two sisters-in-law, the Judge concluded that \u201cthe lack of feelings \nor affection for these in-laws mitigates the security concern.\u201d Id. at 12. Finally, and again without \nanalyzing any particular disqualifying or mitigating conditions, the Judge found that Applicant \ndoes not interact with his brother-in-law and concluded that the relationship does not pose a \nsecurity concern. Id. at 11. \nOn cross-appeal, the Government contends that the Judge\u2019s favorable conclusions \nregarding Applicant\u2019s siblings-in-law are arbitrary, capricious, unsupported by the evidence. A \njudge\u2019s decision can be found to be arbitrary or capricious if it \u201cfails to examine relevant evidence, \nfails to articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made, fails to be \nbased on a consideration of relevant factors, involves a clear error of judgment, fails to consider \nan important aspect of the case, or is so implausible as to indicate more than a mere difference of \nopinion.\u201d ISCR Case No. 94-0215, 1995 WL 396942 at *3 (App. Bd. Apr. 13, 1995) (citing Motor \nVehicle Mfr. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). For the reasons set forth \nbelow, we agree with the Government\u2019s arguments regarding these foreign family members. \nContact with Brother-in-Law \nThe Government first challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant \u201cdoes not interact with \nhis brother-in-law,\u201d arguing that it is unsupported by the record and apparently led the Judge to \nconclude that no disqualifying conditions applied. The Government argues instead that the \nevidence shows that Applicant regularly sees his brother-in-law and that such contact establishes \ndisqualification under Guideline B, which may then afford a separate mitigation analysis.5 Gov. \nAppeal Brief at 2, 7. \n5 The SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s sisters-in-law resided in the United Kingdom; however, Applicant clarified at \nhearing that they actually reside in Kuwait.

He went on to testify that he \u201cmight see [the brother-in-law] once every \nthree months if he comes over to the family gathering Fridays,\u201d but otherwise \u201c[doesn\u2019t] really \ninteract with him.\u201d Id. at 50. In his earlier 2021 security clearance application, however, Applicant \ndisclosed seeing his brother-in-law on a monthly basis for \u201cFriday Family Day,\u201d and seeing his \nsisters-in-law on a weekly basis at the same gathering. GE 2 at 56-59. Notably, Applicant did not \nselect the \u201cQuarterly\u201d option as his frequency of contact with his brother-in-law, which would \nbetter comport with his hearing testimony, and which suggests that \u201cMonthly\u201d was more accurate.7 \nIn light of the foregoing evidentiary conflicts, the Judge should have explained why he found \nApplicant\u2019s hearing testimony more credible than his security clearance application, and his failure \nto do so was error. See ISCR Case No. 99-0435, 2000 WL 1805215 at *2 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2000). \nThe Government also challenges the Judge\u2019s reliance on Applicant\u2019s frequency of contact \nwith the brother-in-law as a basis for determining that the relationship is not disqualifying, arguing \nthat the \u201cinfrequency of contact with foreign family member goes to whether that connection is \nmitigated, not whether that connection establishes a security concern at all.\u201d Gov. Appeal Brief at \n9. The Government contends that the brother-in-law presents a security concern based on his \nconnections to the Kuwait Government, namely via his \u201crecent retirement from a state-owned \nbusiness,\u201d and the Judge erred in failing to conduct this baseline analysis. Id. at 8. \nAG \u00b6 7(a) affords disqualification based on an applicant\u2019s contact with a foreign citizen or \nresident \u201cif that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d As discussed above, the record is clear that Applicant has \nsome level of regular contact with his brother-in-law. Turning to the second element of the \ndisqualifying condition, \u201cheightened risk\u201d \u2013 a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having \na contact living under a foreign government \u2013 is not a high standard to meet. See ISCR Case No. \n17-03026, 2019 WL 995681 at *3 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2019) (citation omitted). Here, the brother-\nin-law is a retired employee of a Kuwaiti-operated oil company and receives $150,000 in \nretirement benefits as his sole source of income. GE 2 at 56; GE 3 at 10; Tr. at 116. He therefore \ncontinues to be tied to the Kuwaiti government and Applicant\u2019s contact with him raises a prima \nfacie security concern sufficient to shift the burden to Applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, \nextenuation, or mitigation. Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the Judge erred in declining \nto apply AG \u00b6 7(a) to Applicant\u2019s relationship with his brother-in-law. \n6 The record also suggests that Applicant\u2019s siblings-in-law reside in their mother\u2019s home with her. See GE 2 at 54-60 \n(reflecting the same residential address for all four subject in-laws). \n7 Additionally, in his earlier 2017 security clearance interview and prior to his relocation to Kuwait, Applicant \ndescribed his frequency of contact with his brother-in-law as \u201conce or twice per month by phone.\u201d GE 4 at 10. \ns \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTies of Affection to Siblings-in-Law \nIn finding that Applicant\u2019s relationship with his mother-in-law creates an unmitigated \nsecurity risk, the Judge correctly noted the Appeal Board\u2019s longstanding position that there is a \nrebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate \nfamily members of the person\u2019s spouse. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 WL 31341788 \nat *3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). Based on the finding that Applicant does not care for them, \nhowever, the Judge stopped short of conducting the same analysis for Applicant\u2019s siblings-in-law. \nWhile Applicant may not be, as the Judge put it, \u201cparticularly fond of\u201d his siblings-in-law \n(Decision at 7; Tr. at 116-117), such an analysis misses the point of the foregoing precedent and \nthe analytical standard for the security risk posed by in-laws under Guideline B. \nThe case law regarding an applicant\u2019s ties of affections for his or her in-laws has less to do \nwith the applicant\u2019s feelings towards that family, but instead contemplates the bonds of affection \nthat the applicant\u2019s spouse holds for his or her immediate family members, which is then imputed \nto the applicant as a result of the marital relationship. This is true even though an applicant has \nminimal or no direct contact with the relatives. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-17673, 2009 WL \n1281213 at *2 (App. Bd. Apr. 2, 2009) (Despite not speaking the same language and having \nlimited direct contact with his parents-in-law, Applicant had a \u201clegitimate, serious interest\u201d in their \nwelfare due to \u201chis loving relationship with his wife.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 11-04980, 2012 WL \n4766543 at *5 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2012) (Evidence that Applicant has little immediate contact with \nhis foreign relatives and does not speak to them, due in part to a language barrier, \u201cis not sufficient \nto rebut the presumption that he shares a sense of obligation to them through his wife.\u201d). \nAs noted above, Applicant and his wife attend a standing family gathering at his mother\u00ad\nin-law\u2019s home on Fridays, as do his sisters- and brother-in-law. This regular and frequent level of \ncontact is indicative of the depth of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s affection for her family in Kuwait. That \nApplicant has limited \u201cinteraction\u201d with the siblings-in-law or even that he does not like them has \nno bearing on his wife\u2019s feelings towards that family. Having established that AG \u00b6 7(a) applied \nto Applicant\u2019s siblings-in-law, the Government persuasively argues that Applicant presented no \nevidence to rebut the affection demonstrated between his wife and her siblings and the Judge \ntherefore erred in failing to impute that affection to Applicant. In light of the record in this case, \nwe find that the Judge erred in applying AG \u00b6 8(c)8 to Applicant\u2019s siblings-in-law and concluding \nthat they do not pose a security risk. \nConclusion \nWe first conclude that Applicant\u2019s appeal has not established that the Judge committed \nharmful error. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation \nfor the decision under Guideline E and the Guideline B allegations regarding Applicant\u2019s wife and \nmother-in-law, and the ultimate adverse decision is sustainable on this record. \n8 AG \u00b6 8(c) \u2013 contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood \nthat it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation. \ns \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTurning to the Government\u2019s cross-appeal, we find that the Judge\u2019s Guideline B analysis \nregarding Applicant\u2019s brother- and sisters-in-law fails to articulate a rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made, fails to consider important aspects of the case, and runs \ncontrary to the weight of the record evidence. The formal findings on these two allegations are not \nsustainable. \nAccordingly, we affirm the Judge\u2019s adverse Guideline E findings and adverse Guideline B \nfindings for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b and reverse his favorable Guideline B findings for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and \n2.d. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with \nthe interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Aldridge, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nAugust 20, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and H (Drug \nInvolvement) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a hearing, which was held on October 26, 2023. On March 14, \n2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Ross D. Hyams concluded \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guidelines E and H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying \nfrequency between 1978 and 2018, at times while having been granted access to classified \ninformation. The Administrative Judge found against Applicant as to each of the allegations. On \nappeal, Applicant does not challenge the Judge\u2019s factual findings, but rather argues that the Judge \ndid not appropriately weigh those facts relative to the Mitigating Conditions. He also asserts that \nthe Government is estopped from denying Applicant a clearance based upon his drug use because \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis use was previously known to the Government and he had been granted access to classified \ninformation in the past. We find that estoppel does not apply in this situation and the Judge \nadequately addressed Applicant\u2019s circumstances in his decision. \nTo the extent that an applicant has been granted eligibility for access to classified \ninformation in the past, neither estoppel nor reciprocity precludes revocation or denial of a security \nclearance. \u201c[P]ossession of a previously granted clearance does not give rise to any right or vested \ninterest, nor does any favorable clearance decision preclude the Government from reassessing a \nperson's security eligibility in light of current circumstances.\" ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 3 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007). It is well established that there is no right to a security clearance, nor is there a \npresumption in favor of granting or continuing a security clearance. \u201cPrior security clearance \nadjudications and the granting of clearances for the Applicant have no bearing on the legal \nsufficiency of the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision here.\u201d ISCR Case No. 07-00260 at 3 (App. \nBd. Jan. 24, 2008) (internal citations omitted). Past conduct may be considered \"even where the \npast conduct was considered in a prior favorable adjudication.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-12742 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 25, 2011). The Government simply cannot be estopped from protecting classified \ninformation and reviewing the facts anew. E.g. ISCR Case No. 94-0966 at 3 (App. Bd. July 21, \n1995). Moreover, the Board is in the position of reviewing only the instant case, not any prior \nadjudication of Applicant's security clearance eligibility. ISCR Case No. 09-07066 at 4 (July 26, \n2011). \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s arguments advocate for an alternative weighing of the \nevidence. An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability to \nargue for a different interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that the judge \nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary \nto law. E.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Moreover, Applicant\u2019s \narguments fail to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence. The \nmere presence of some favorable or mitigating evidence does not require the Judge to make an \noverall favorable determination in the face of disqualifying conduct such as Applicant\u2019s. See ISCR \nCase No. 04-08975 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006). \nWe have considered the entirety of the arguments contained in Applicant\u2019s appeal brief. \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made.\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

On \nJuly 8, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, \n2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a \nhearing. On June 6, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Nicole \nL. Noel denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For reasons stated below, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged seven delinquent debts totaling approximately \n$28,500. The Judge found against Applicant on all allegations. On appeal, Applicant argues that \nthe Administrative Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious because it failed to consider \ncertain facts in mitigation. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s Counsel suggests that Applicant emailed \ndocuments to the Judge or her office that were not considered in her decision. As discussed below, \nour review reveals no basis for either allegation, and we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTuring to the first issue, Applicant argues that the Judge failed to consider the following \n\u201ccrucial facts\u201d: that Applicant had paid the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.c; that he resolved a second \ndebt through efforts, albeit unsuccessful, to locate the proper creditor; and that Applicant is a \n\u201cstandout performer at work.\u201d Appeal Brief (AB) at 7. As the Judge noted in her decision, \nApplicant claimed to have paid the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, but he provided no documentation \neither at the hearing or post-hearing, although she kept the record open for over a month. Decision \nat 2. Similarly, Applicant provided no evidence regarding his work performance or his efforts to \nlocate the creditor. This allegation is without merit. \nRegarding the second issue, Applicant\u2019s Counsel does not raise the specter of missing \nevidence until the \u201cConclusion,\u201d section of his brief, in which he requests remand to \u201c[e]nsure all \nevidence and documents submitted by [Applicant] via email to the DOHA agent are included in \nthe record.\u201d AB at 8. With no further explanation, Counsel argues that \u201cthe case should be \nremanded to allow consideration of additional relevant evidence submitted by the originally pro \nse [Applicant]. Id. Counsel provides no details whatsoever about Applicant\u2019s submissions or a \ncopy of what was purportedly emailed. An applicant must make a sufficient proffer as to whether \nthere is a sufficient basis for the Board to remand the case or take other corrective action. Counsel\u2019s \nvague suggestion that Applicant emailed documents is not sufficient to establish a prima facie \nshowing that Applicant actually submitted additional evidence or documents that were not \nincluded in the record. E.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04959 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2016). Applicant has \nnot established that he was denied the due process afforded by the Directive. \nApplicant has failed to establish any harmful error below. The record supports a conclusion \nthat the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the \ndecision. The decision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may \nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department \nof the Navy v.

On \nNovember 11, 2020, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guidelines B (Foreign Influence) and E (Personal Conduct) \nof the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nOn February 27, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Judge Nichole L. Noel denied \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and \nE3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline B, the SOR, as amended, alleged that Applicant\u2019s spouse, mother-in-law, \nand friend are citizens and residents of Colombia. The Judge found the Guideline B allegations in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. Therefore, although Applicant addresses this allegation on appeal, it is not a \nmatter under review.

Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his mid-30s and worked as an engineer for a federal contracting company \nfrom April 2017 to February 2023, at which time he was placed on administrative leave pending \nthe outcome of his security clearance adjudication. He has held a security clearance since \nSeptember 2015. In March 2018, Applicant\u2019s employer filed an incident report regarding his travel \nto Colombia and his relationship with a Colombian woman. In conjunction with the incident report, \na Defense Security Service counterintelligence investigator interviewed Applicant at which time \nApplicant acknowledged that he traveled to Colombia in August 2017 and February 2018, and that \nhe was engaged to marry a Colombian national. Applicant also was interviewed on February 21, \n2019, and March 28, 2019. During the February 2019 interview, Applicant told the investigator \nthat, in August 2017, in response to an inquiry from his supervisor regarding his failure to return \nfrom an assignment, he had informed the supervisor that he was travelling to his home country of \nGhana to attend a family event but changed his mind and traveled to Colombia instead. He did not \nreport this trip in advance, nor his intended trip to Ghana, and stated that he was unaware of a \nrequirement to do so. He also told the investigator that, while on that trip, he met his future wife, \na Colombian woman, while walking through a shopping mall. He denied meeting the woman \nbefore the trip. \nDuring the March 2019 interview, Applicant eventually acknowledged that he also did not \nreport his February 2018 travel to Colombia, asserting that he did not know he needed to do so. \nApplicant again denied knowing his wife before his first trip to Colombia in August 2017 and \nreiterated that he met her for the first time during the trip. After being further questioned about the \ncircumstances under which he met his wife, Applicant admitted that he met her on an online dating \nsite around May 2017. He stated that he did not previously disclose this because he was \nembarrassed by meeting his spouse online and did not want people to look at him differently. \nIn his May 2020 response to interrogatories, Applicant stated, \u201c[d]ue to stigmatization that \n\u2018oh he met his wife online,\u2019 I did not disclose that I met my wife online first. I met my wife online \nin summer 2017.\u201d Decision at 6 (citing Government Exhibit 2). Applicant made numerous other \ntrips to Columbia and subsequently divorced his wife in April 2022 after she refused to cooperate \nwith the process required to immigrate to the United States. That same month, Applicant met \nanother Colombian woman online and returned to Columbia in September 2022 to visit her in-\nperson. He claims that after that visit he decided not to pursue that relationship or any other with \na foreign national. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nApplicant argues on appeal that the Judge was biased against him. We do not find his \nargument persuasive. There is a rebuttable presumption that a judge is impartial and unbiased, and \na party seeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion. See ISCR Case \nNo. 02-08032 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004). The issue is not whether Applicant personally \nbelieves that the Judge was biased or prejudiced against him but, rather, whether the record \n\u201ccontains any indication that the Judge acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to \nquestion the fairness and impartiality of the Judge.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 01-04713 at 2 (App. Bd. \nMar. 27, 2003). \nApplicant\u2019s allegation of bias appears to be premised in his belief that the Judge\u2019s finding \nthat Applicant lacked credibility could only be the result of a biased assessment. His vague \nexample asserts that, because he e-mailed the Judge prior to the hearing and the Judge directed \nhim not do so, her \u201cemotions\u201d influenced her adverse credibility determination. There is no nexus \nbetween these two points. Formulating an opinion of Applicant\u2019s credibility is permissible and \nwithin the scope of the Judge\u2019s role, particularly in a case involving alleged lies. A judge may form \nand express an opinion about the evidence at hearing, including the credibility of a witness or the \napplicant. This does not demonstrate bias. See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 94-0972, 1995 WL 470208 \nat *3 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 1995) (citing Okura & Co. v. Tobey, 871 F.2d 775, 776 (8th Cir. 1989)). \nThe transcript in this matter reflects that the Judge\u2019s questions were often pointed; however, they \nwere targeted to the issues to be determined at hearing. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-24632 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 19, 2006) (no bias even though the judge\u2019s comments were \u201cgratuitous and at times \nharsh\u201d); ISCR Case No. 15-03162 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2017) (no impartiality although the judge \n\u201cquestioned Applicant sharply at times\u201d); ISCR Case No. 16-03451 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) \n(no bias although judge \u201cconveyed a certain testiness\u201d); ISCR Case No. 20-02787 at 4 (App. Bd. \nMar. 9, 2022) (no impartiality where the judge\u2019s \u201cquestioning and comments were occasionally \nsharp\u201d). \nHaving examined the record, we find that there is substantial independent evidence upon \nwhich the Judge\u2019s credibility determination was based, including that Applicant was trained \nregarding his obligation to report foreign travel and admitted that he lied to investigators about \nwhen and how he met his former spouse. There is nothing in the record that would likely persuade \na reasonable person that the Judge lacked the requisite impartiality. Applicant\u2019s concerns are \ninsufficient to overcome the rebuttable presumption that the Judge acted in an impartial and \nunbiased manner. \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s challenges to the findings and whole person analysis fail to \nestablish any harmful error. The Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are \u201cbased upon \nsubstantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences or conclusions that could be drawn from \nthe evidence,\u201d and Applicant has cited to no harmful error in the Judge\u2019s findings. See ISCR Case \nNo. 12-03420 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2014). \nWe find that the Judge adequately addressed the circumstances surrounding all aspects of \nApplicant\u2019s travel to Columbia, the parameters of his relationship with his ex-wife, and the manner \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin which he revealed this information to his employer and Government officials. Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cdisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different \ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence \nor reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Moreover, Applicant\u2019s arguments fail to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence. The Judge\u2019s conclusion that \nApplicant failed to mitigate the personal conduct security concerns is sustainable. \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he \nshould be granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated \na satisfactory explanation for the decision, which is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the \nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of \nthe national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \nOrder \nThe decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Allison Marie \nAllison Marie \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \nSigned: James B.

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe Judge scheduled and held an initial session in August 2023 but continued the hearing \nin part because Applicant raised a jurisdictional question with regard to sponsorship (i.e., whether \nthe position for which he was hired required a security clearance).

Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged 17 security concerns: a series of 13 \narrests and criminal offenses between 1994 and 2009; two falsifications of his security clearance \napplication (SCA) by failing to disclose delinquent debts and Driving Under the Influence (DUI) \ncharges; and two falsifications during his security clearance interview by denying delinquent debts \nand denying criminal offenses when confronted with the charges. Under Guideline F, the SOR \nalleged seven debts in collections. The Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor on the 13 Guideline E \ncriminal conduct allegations and against Applicant on the four Guideline E falsifications and the \nGuideline F allegations. \nApplicant is in his late-40s and divorced with three children. Decision at 2. In summarizing \nhis decision, the Judge held that the criminal offenses alleged under Guideline E were dated and \nmitigated by time, but that the falsification allegations for failing to disclose two DUI offenses and \ndelinquent debts on his SCA and for failing to acknowledge any debts or criminal offenses during \nhis background interview were not mitigated. Additionally, although the Judge concluded that the \ncriminal offenses were mitigated by the passage of time, he noted that the \u201coverall mitigation effect \n. . . is undercut by his recent, repeated false statements and refusals to accept responsibility for his \nactions and his debts, especially during the security clearance process.\u201d Id. at 13. Under Guideline \nF, the Judge held that debts totaling about $127,000 were detailed in Applicant\u2019s 2019 and 2020 \ncredit reports and that Applicant\u2019s assertion that they were not his responsibility was not supported \nby evidence. Id. at 11. \nOn appeal, Applicant again raises a quasi-jurisdictional issue, arguing that adjudication of \nhis July 2019 SCA should have terminated when he was laid off in May 2021 and that a new \napplication and adjudication should have been initiated upon his November 2021 re-hire. \nAdditionally, Applicant argues that he misinterpreted the questions in his SCA, that he should have \nbeen offered an opportunity to resubmit a corrected SCA, and that the Judge failed to consider \ncredit reports and other financial evidence he submitted. \nFirst, the record fully supports DOHA\u2019s jurisdiction. Our review of the record indicates \nthat the SOR was issued and answered prior to Applicant being laid off in May 2021 and that no \nfurther steps were taken until June 2022, well after Applicant was re-hired and again sponsored \nfor a clearance. Prior to hearing, Department Counsel confirmed sponsorship, and she did so again \nafter Applicant\u2014in the initial session\u2014questioned whether his position required a clearance. The \nDirective provides that\u2014subject to certain exceptions\u2014adjudication \u201cshall cease upon termination \nof the applicant\u2019s need for access to classified information.\u201d Directive \u00b6 4.4. Here, once \nApplicant\u2019s employer confirmed Applicant\u2019s current need for access to classified information, the \nJudge properly found that subject matter jurisdiction was established. Applicant provides no \nauthority for his position that the entire application and adjudication process should have begun \nanew after his brief hiatus from employment, and we are aware of none. \nNext, Applicant asserts that he misunderstood the SCA questions and requests that he be \ngiven an opportunity to submit a corrected SCA. Applicant did not report any criminal record on \nhis 2019 SCA and did not disclose any delinquent debts. Decision at 7; GE 1. In testimony, he \ndenied any falsification and said that he answered the SCA to the best of his ability. He has had no \narrests or offenses since 2009. Decision at 7; Tr. 20, 50-54, 123, GE 1.

He said he was not aware until recently that \nthe question asked, \u201cHave you ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol or \ndrugs.\u201d Decision at 6. The Judge concluded: \nApplicant had a duty to disclose both [DUIs] on his 2019 SCA under the \u201cHave \nyou ever been charged with an offense related to alcohol or drugs\u201d question and did \nnot do so. His explanation that he did not believe he had to report offenses that did \nnot result in a conviction is not credible. . . . Applicant also failed to disclose any \ndelinquent debts on his SCA, in answer to questions calling for disclosure of that \ninformation. . . . Perhaps most troubling, the record supports a conclusion that \nApplicant repeatedly failed to acknowledge either any criminal offenses or arrests \nduring his background interview (even offenses that need not have been disclosed \non the SCA). He repeatedly cited his brother as the one responsible for many of the \noffenses, when the record said otherwise. He also repeatedly failed to acknowledge \nany delinquent debts until he was confronted about them by the interviewer. [Id. at \n12\u201313.] \nThe Administrative Judge, as trier of fact, is entitled to weigh the evidence and make \ncredibility determinations about witnesses (including applicants). Because of the Administrative \nJudge's ability to personally observe the demeanor of witnesses, the Judge's credibility \ndeterminations are entitled to deference on appeal. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. Although credibility \ndeterminations are not immune from review, an appealing party has a heavy burden to meet before \nthe Board will disturb or overturn a Judge's credibility determination. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n96-0608 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997). Here, the Judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination and \nfindings against Applicant on the falsification allegations are adequately supported by record \nevidence. \nFinally, the record provides us no reason to conclude that the Judge did not consider all of \nthe record evidence or Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing. Applicant submitted seven exhibits \nwith his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, and all of the exhibits were admitted into the record. \nHe was provided an opportunity to supplement his document submission after the hearing, but he \ndid not. There is a rebuttable presumption that the Administrative Judge considered all of the \nrecord evidence, and the appealing party has a heavy burden when trying to rebut that presumption. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-00110 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2020). Applicant\u2019s submission of \nmitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance \ndecision. As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether \nthe favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. An applicant\u2019s \ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different \ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence \nor reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant was terminated by a prior employer \nand that he falsified certain information in his security clearance investigation. Under Guideline I, \nthe SOR alleged that a licensed psychologist determined that Applicant \u201cmet criteria for Other \nspecified personality disorder, mixed personality features.\u201d The Judge found that Applicant had \nmitigated the concerns under Guideline E but failed to mitigate the concern under Guideline I.

He has a \nBachelor of Science degree. He has worked for a defense contractor \nsince October of 2018. Applicant was honorably discharged from \nthe [military] in June of 1989.

Applicant was evaluated by a duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (as stipulated to by Applicant\u2019s Counsel) on June 30, \n2022, with a brief follow-up interview on June 26, 2022. This \npsychologist, who testified at length at Applicant\u2019s hearing, \ndetermined that Applicant met the criteria for Other Specified \nPersonality Disorder, Mixed Personality Features. The psychologist \nnoted that Applicant exhibited a lack of candor regarding his \npersonal history, with a high level of defensiveness, and an \nexaggerated response to perceived threats throughout his evaluation \nprocess. He also noted that he was unable to complete the second \ninterview due to Applicant\u2019s defensive, redundant, and non-\nresponsive statements. The psychologist opined that this conduct \nindicated a deficit in Applicant\u2019s judgment that may impair his \nability to safeguard classified information. [Decision at 2 (internal \ncitations omitted).] \nThe Judge\u2019s substantive analysis of the disqualifying evidence was limited to the following: \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 28 contains five conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying.

In this instance, the Government\u2019s \nwitness, Dr. S., was of the opinion that Applicant\u2019s \u201cother specified personality disorder, mixed \npersonality features\u201d diagnosis resulted in such an impairment. Government Exhibit 4; Tr. at 39\u00ad\n42. Applicant presented no expert witness testimony or any mental health evaluations to rebut the \npersonality disorder diagnosis or Dr. S.\u2019s opinion based thereon. Therefore, although the Judge did \nnot specifically discuss the facts relative to the Guidelines, when read in the context of the specific \ndiagnosis and testimony of Dr. S., the conclusion that there was substantial evidence under AG \u00b6 \n28(b) is uncontroverted and supported by the facts. The analysis, however, does not end there. A \njudge also must consider facts that may mitigate this concern. The Judge failed to do so in this \ncase. \nApplicant argues that Dr. S. should not have concluded that Applicant\u2019s mental health \ncondition adversely impacts his judgment because he has exercised good workplace judgment in \nthe past, which potentially raises Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 29(e). At hearing, Dr. S. was \nexamined on this contention and addressed the relationship between Applicant\u2019s past conduct and \nhis diagnosis. Although this was an integral part of Applicant\u2019s mitigation presentation, the Judge \ndid not discuss this important aspect of the case in his decision, which is problematic. \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a judge considered all the record evidence unless the \njudge specifically states otherwise. See ISCR Case No. 94-0057, 1994 WL 728443 at *3 (App. Bd. \nSep. 21, 1994). That said, a decision cannot simply be silent about what, as a matter of common \nsense, appears to be a relevant factor that could be an important aspect of the case. See ISCR Case \nNo. 02-19479, 2004 WL 2152723 at *4 (App. Bd. Jun. 22, 2004). Although a judge is not required \nto discuss each and every piece of record evidence, his failure to discuss important aspects of a \ncase is error. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-07874, 2005 WL 3814738 at *3 (App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2005). \nA judge\u2019s findings of fact must be based on the record evidence as a whole, including any evidence \nthat runs contrary to those findings. Furthermore, if a judge does not discuss or even mention a \nsignificant aspect of the case that reasonably could be expected to be explicitly taken into account \nin the decision, then a serious question arises as to whether the judge forgot that aspect, ignored it, \nfailed to take it into account, dismissed that aspect of the case for no apparent reason, failed to \nunderstand the significance of that aspect of the case, or engaged in an arbitrary and capricious \nanalysis. See ISCR Case No. 02-02195, 2004 WL 1434390 at *3 (App. Bd. Apr. 9, 2004). In this \ncase, the Judge\u2019s failure to discuss or even mention Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence leaves his \nanalysis incomplete and constitutes error. \nConclusion \nIn light of the error identified, above, the best resolution of this case is to remand it to the \nJudge to correct the error and for further processing consistent with the Directive. Upon remand, \na judge is required to issue a new decision. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35. The Board retains no jurisdiction \nover a remanded decision.

On \nMarch 22, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline I (Psychological Conditions) and Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, \n1992, as amended) (Directive). On November 16, 2023, after a hearing, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola denied Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. On \nFebruary 13, 2024, the Appeal Board issued a decision remanding the case to the Judge to correct \nidentified errors and for further processing consistent with the Directive. On March 22, 2024, the \nJudge issued a Decision on Remand denying Applicant\u2019s request for security clearance eligibility. \nApplicant appealed that decision. \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant was terminated by a prior employer \nand that he falsified certain information in his security clearance investigation and during a mental \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth evaluation. Under Guideline I, the SOR alleged that a licensed psychologist determined that \nApplicant met criteria for Other Specified Personality Disorder, Mixed Personality Features. The \nJudge found that Applicant had mitigated the concerns under Guideline E but failed to mitigate \nthe concern under Guideline I. \nOn appeal, Applicant presents arguments similar to those raised in his first appeal.1 He \nagain argues that the Judge erred in finding that Guideline I, Disqualifying Condition \u00b6 28(b) was \nsupported by the mental health examination conducted by the Government\u2019s witness, Dr. S. He \nalso argues that the Judge did not adequately weigh mitigating facts in his favor. Finally, he asserts \nthat because the Judge determined that the concerns under Guideline E were mitigated, he was \nprecluded from finding against Applicant under Guideline I. For the reasons discussed below, none \nof these allegations have merit. \nIn deciding whether a judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we review the judge\u2019s \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. E.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015). \nIn our previous decision, the Board concluded that \u201calthough the Judge did not specifically \ndiscuss the facts relative to the Guidelines, when read in the context of the specific diagnosis and \ntestimony of Dr. S., the conclusion that there was substantial evidence under AG \u00b6 28(b) is \nuncontroverted and supported by the facts.\u201d ISCR Case No. 20-02097 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, \n2024). Nothing in Applicant\u2019s current submission or the record supports any change to that \nconclusion. Applicant simply argues for an alternative weighing of the evidence on this issue. A \ndisagreement or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to \ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. E.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, \n2007). \nAlthough there was no error in the weighing of Dr. S\u2019s testimony, we previously concluded \nthat \u201cthe Judge's failure to discuss or even mention Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence leaves his case \nanalysis incomplete and constitutes error.\u201d That error was the basis for the remand. In his Remand \nDecision, the Judge included an expanded analysis of the evidence. He stated that he considered \nApplicant\u2019s exhibits, including Applicant\u2019s 2023 award and mid-year performance review; his \n\u201ccommendable\u201d mid-year and full-year review; his letters of recommendation; his awards and \nceremonies; his honorable discharge from the U.S. Navy; and his performance evaluations and \ntraining certificates. Remand Decision at 6. Similarly, under the whole person analysis, the Judge \n1 On June 16, 2024 Applicant submitted a second brief in this proceeding, asserting that the Government\u2019s reply brief \ncontained new evidence. The Directive only authorizes one brief from each party. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.30; ISCR Case No. \n17-03228 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2019.) Even if we could consider his untimely submission, we note that it is largely \nrepetitive of the issues raised in his appeal brief. Furthermore, it is well-established that if either party submits new \nevidence on appeal it may not be considered by the Board.

Thus, the Judge corrected the \nerror identified in the first appeal. \nAdministrative judges have broad latitude and discretion in how to write their decisions, \nprovided they issue decisions that (a) comply with pertinent provisions of the Directive, and (b) \nset forth their findings and conclusions with sufficient specificity and clarity that allow the parties \nand the Board to discern what the Judge is finding and concluding. ISCR Case No. 00-0621 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2002). In this case, a reading of the decision below persuades the Board that the \nJudge: (i) fulfilled his duty to consider the evidence as a whole, and (ii) issued a decision that is \nconsistent with the requirements of pertinent provisions of the Directive and allows the parties and \nthe Board to discern what the Judge found and concluded. Applicant's dissatisfaction with the \nJudge's choice to not write more extensively about evidence that he feels is favorable to him is \ninsufficient to demonstrate the Judge acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to \nlaw. Id. \nApplicant\u2019s assertion that because the Judge found in his favor under Guideline E regarding \nallegations pertaining to his mental health evaluation he must find in his favor under Guideline I \nis a non-sequitur. The fact that the Judge concluded that Applicant had not willfully falsified \nmaterial facts during the evaluation is not inconsistent with Dr. S\u2019s conclusion that Applicant \nlacked candor at times during his interviews. The Judge\u2019s conclusion under Guideline E regarding \nfalsification has no bearing or relationship to his Guideline I analysis. \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error and his arguments \nfail to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence. We have \nconsidered the entirety of the arguments contained in Applicant\u2019s appeal brief.

On \nSeptember 19, 2022, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis \nof that decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD \nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On July 19, 2024, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Stephanie C. Hess denied Applicant security \nclearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nBackground \nApplicant is in his mid-thirties. In March 2008, when he was twenty years old, he \ncompleted a security clearance application (SCA) and disclosed no illegal drug activity since the \nage of sixteen. Government Exhibit (GE) 3 at 8. He was subsequently granted a security clearance \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin 2008. Applicant completed a new SCA in May 2015 and again disclosed no illegal drug activity \nwithin the prior seven years or ever while holding a security clearance. GE 2 at 24-25. \nIn October 2018, Applicant participated in a polygraph examination and interviews with \nanother government agency and initially reported no illegal drug use. GE 4 at 5, 11. During a first \nfollow-up interview and in response to why he was unable to \u201cresolve the previous examination,\u201d \nApplicant stated that he had been \u201cthinking about a party\u201d and described a 2013 incident where he \nwas driving to a party with his brother and friends who were smoking marijuana in the vehicle and \nhe may have gotten a contact high. Id. at 4-5. Physiological responses were detected, and Applicant \nthen disclosed an incident in 2016 where he advised his visiting cousins on how to obtain \nmarijuana, which they did, and he intentionally entered a vehicle where they were smoking with \nthe windows rolled up. When questioned about why he had not previously disclosed the 2016 \nincident, Applicant explained that he \u201cthought mentioning the party in summer 2013 would be \nenough information to \u2018get him through\u2019 the polygraph.\u201d Id. After physiological responses were \nagain observed and he was questioned further, Applicant revealed that, from 2005 to 2011, he used \nmarijuana between 150 and 300 times and purchased marijuana regularly. He acknowledged that \nhe did not disclose any illegal drug involvement on his prior security clearance forms because it \nwas \u201conly\u201d marijuana. Id. at 11. \nApplicant was referred for a new security clearance investigation and, in the ensuing \nSeptember 2019 SCA and December 2019 security clearance interview, he once again disclosed \nno illegal drug activity within the prior seven years or ever while holding a security clearance. GE \n1 at 35-36; GE 5 at 11. Applicant participated in another clearance interview in October 2020, \nwherein he asserted that: 1) he had never used or purchased any drugs; 2) he did not use marijuana \nfrom 2005 until 2011; and 3) he was not asked about alcohol or drugs during his polygraph \nexamination. GE 5 at 6-7. He volunteered only that he used marijuana once in 2004. Id. at 7. \nBased on the foregoing, the SOR alleged under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana \nfrom 2004 until at least 2016, including while granted access to classified information beginning \nin 2008, and that he purchased marijuana on various occasions between 2005 and 2011. The SOR \ncross-alleged those allegations under Guideline E and further alleged that Applicant deliberately \nfailed to disclose his marijuana use on his March 2008 SCA, and that he deliberately failed to \ndisclose his marijuana use, including while holding a security clearance, on his 2015 and 2019 \nSCAs and during his 2020 security clearance interview. \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant denied all allegations, asserting that he had not used or \npurchased marijuana since 2004, that he never used marijuana while holding a security clearance, \nand that any reporting errors during his clearance investigations were not deliberate. At hearing, \nApplicant testified that he did not remember telling the polygrapher that he used marijuana 150 to \n300 times between 2005 and 2011 and maintained that he last used marijuana in about 2004. Tr. \nat 22-23, 27. \nThe Judge noted that \u201cApplicant was unable to offer a plausible explanation for why his \nversion of his past conduct, specifically his use and purchase of marijuana, cannot be reconciled \nwith the recorded statements he made during the two polygraph examinations.\u201d Decision at 9-10. \nShe found adversely on all allegations, concluding that Applicant\u2019s \u201cquestionable judgment, lack \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nof candor, dishonesty, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations raise questions \nabout his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information\u201d and \nthat \u201cApplicant\u2019s repeated failure to provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative and adjudicative processes\u201d was particularly concerning. Id. at 10. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant raises various due process issues stemming from his receipt of two \nSORs in this matter. He contends that he was initially issued an SOR, \u201cwhich was dismissed \nbecause [the Government] withdrew their SOR,\u201d and that, \u201c[a]lmost immediately [the \nGovernment] opened a second case ISCR Case No. 21-00164 without proper[ly] notifying me that \nthis was a separate case altogether, and that I needed to provide new evidence for the SOR that \nwas given to me.\u201d Appeal Brief. He goes on to allege that he \u201cdid not have a chance to gather \nevidence or seek legal counsel in this new case.\u201d Id. Applicant\u2019s arguments can be summarized as \nchallenges to his 1) receipt of proper notice and 2) ability to present evidence in support of his case \nfor mitigation. \nIn its reply, the Government provides new documentation addressing Applicant\u2019s due \nprocess claims and the case\u2019s procedural history. The Appeal Board is generally prohibited from \nconsidering new evidence. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. We may, however, consider new evidence insofar \nas it bears upon threshold issues of due process or jurisdiction. See ISCR Case No. 08-07664, 2009 \nWL 5323078 at *2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009). \nNotice and Opportunity to Respond \nApplicant contends that the two SORs were issued in different cases, asserting that the first \ncase was \u201cdismissed because DOHA withdrew their SOR\u201d and that a second case was opened \n\u201calmost immediately.\u201d Appeal Brief. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s assertion, however, both SORs were \nissued to Applicant in the same, above-captioned case \u2013 ISCR Case No. 21-00164.1 While the \nrecord reflects that the original SOR was withdrawn before an updated SOR could be issued, \nnothing in the record supports that Applicant\u2019s case was ever dismissed.2 \nTo the extent that Applicant\u2019s appeal challenges his receipt of proper notice of the \nallegations against him, this argument is unpersuasive. Our review of the record reflects the \nfollowing facts relevant to Applicant\u2019s notice of the SOR allegations. The decision to issue an \nSOR followed from Applicant\u2019s unsuccessful 2018 polygraph and triggered 2019 security \nclearance reinvestigation. On January 25, 2022, the original SOR was issued in this case and \nalleged concerns under both Guidelines H and E based on Applicant\u2019s undisclosed marijuana \n1 The original SOR was issued under the case caption \u201cISCR Case No. 20-00164\u201d; however, all subsequent \ncorrespondence regarding this original SOR refers to ISCR Case No. 21-00164, which indicates that the different year \non the SOR itself was merely a typographical error. \n2 Even if a first case had been dismissed before a new SOR was issued under a second case number, it is unclear how \nsuch an action would amount to improper notice or otherwise prejudice Applicant\u2019s ability to participate in his case. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninvolvement. Gov. Reply Brief at Encl. 1.3 On February 2, 2022, Applicant acknowledged receipt \nof the original SOR, responded by denying all allegations and providing a one-page narrative \nexplanation for his denial, and requested a decision based on the written record. Id.; Applicant \nExhibit (AE) A; AE E. On July 22, 2022, the original administrative judge notified the Government \nabout various evidentiary issues in its written submission. Gov. Reply Brief at Encl. 2. On August \n3, 2022, the Government withdrew the original SOR to address said issues. Id. \nLess than two months later, on September 19, 2022, the second and current SOR was \nissued, which expanded the previously alleged conduct to include marijuana involvement through \n2016 and falsifications of additional security clearance investigation components. Along with the \nSOR, Applicant received a letter that encouraged him to review an enclosed copy of the Directive, \nwhich describes the DOHA adjudication process in detail and sets forth an applicant\u2019s rights \nregarding representation and obligations regarding the presentation of mitigating evidence. On \nNovember 1, 2022, Applicant responded to the current SOR, again denying all allegations and \nproviding a brief explanation for his denial.4 \nNo other matters beyond those alleged in the current SOR were addressed at hearing or \nconsidered in the Judge\u2019s unfavorable security clearance decision. Applicant has failed to \ndemonstrate that the Government\u2019s decision to withdraw the original SOR and issue a new SOR, \nwhich Applicant received and responded to, deprived him of reasonable notice of the \nGovernment\u2019s concerns about his security clearance worthiness. \nOpportunity to Prepare and Present Case \nApplicant\u2019s primary argument on appeal appear to be that he \u201cdid not have a chance to \ngather evidence or seek legal counsel\u201d to address the current SOR. Appeal Brief. For the following \nreasons, this argument is meritless. \nOn January 26, 2023, after receiving his response to the second SOR, the Government sent \nApplicant a disclosure package, which contained an informational letter and copies of the \nGovernment\u2019s proposed exhibits. The letter again referred Applicant to the Directive and \nencouraged him to review the Guidelines and Mitigating Conditions applicable to his case, noting \nthat, \u201cat your hearing, you may provide additional information, including supporting \ndocumentation and testimony, that addresses those Mitigating Conditions.\u201d The letter also \nreiterated Applicant\u2019s right to represent himself, retain an attorney, or be assisted by a personal \nrepresentative at hearing, and advised him that, \u201cIf you choose to be represented by an attorney, \nyou should retain one promptly.\u201d \nOn August 22, 2023, Applicant was notified that his hearing was scheduled the following \nmonth and he was provided with the Prehearing Guidance for DOHA Industrial Security Clearance \n3 The allegations of the original SOR were similar to those in the second SOR, but the drug involvement was alleged \nonly through 2011, and the falsification allegations were limited to Applicant\u2019s 2015 SCA and 2020 interview. Id. \n4 The substance of the second narrative response was similar, but not identical, to that included in Applicant\u2019s response \nto the original SOR. The second response was included in the Judge\u2019s case file prior to the hearing, and Applicant also \nprovided her with the first response as part of his post-hearing submission. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(ISCR) Hearings, which detailed the basic hearing procedures and directed him, once again, to \nconsult the Directive for further guidance. Id. at Encl. 5. The Guidance reiterated Applicant\u2019s \noptions to appear with or without an attorney or personal representative, and the expectation that \nboth parties be prepared to present their witnesses and documents at the hearing. Id. On August \n24, 2023, the Judge sent Applicant a Case Management Order, which established deadlines and \nprocedures for the parties to submit exhibits and witness lists prior to the hearing. Id. at Encl. 6. \nAt the beginning of the hearing, held on September 14, 2023, the Judge detailed the \nprocedures that would be employed and confirmed that Applicant understood his right to be \nrepresented by an attorney. Tr. at 5. She noted, \u201cI don\u2019t have any exhibits from you yet . . . , but at \nthe end of the proceeding, we will pick a date. I will keep the record open, and you will have the \nability to submit whatever you previously submitted and anything else that seems relevant, things \nthat may come up that we talk about during the hearing or after the fact that you\u2019re recollecting \nthat the Judge should consider this.\u201d Id. at 7. Applicant acknowledged, \u201cOkay.\u201d Id. at 8. At the end \nof the hearing, the Judge asked, \u201cDo you want to go ahead and get those documents that you \npreviously submitted to me?\u201d and Applicant replied affirmatively. Id. at 31. When asked if \nSeptember 29, 2023, would be sufficient time to provide his post-hearing evidence, Applicant \nagain said \u201cYes.\u201d Id. at 32. On September 29, 2023, Applicant submitted several post-hearing \nexhibits, including his narrative response to the original SOR and various character reference \nmaterials. AEs A-E. \nIn summary, more than one year passed between Applicant\u2019s receipt of the current SOR in \nthis matter and the close of the record. During that time, he was repeatedly notified of his ability \nto be represented by an attorney; referred to the Directive; encouraged to review the applicable \nGuidelines and Mitigating Conditions; and notified of his ability to present evidence pertaining to \nthose Mitigating Conditions at hearing. At hearing, Applicant affirmed awareness of his ability to \nbe represented by counsel. He objected neither to the current SOR nor to proceeding with the \nhearing, and he made no assertion that he needed additional time to prepare. \nAll applicants are expected to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights during \nDOHA proceedings and under the Directive, and an applicant\u2019s pro se status does not excuse him \nfrom that obligation. See ISCR Case No. 00-0086 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2000). Any failure to \ntake such steps does not constitute denial of those rights. See ISCR Case No. 02-19896 at 6 (App. \nBd. Dec. 29, 2003). Because Applicant did not object to proceeding or otherwise request additional \ntime to prepare for his case, he cannot fairly claim he was denied due process under the Directive. \nThe record before us shows that Applicant received adequate notice of his right to \nrepresentation, which he knowingly declined, and of his right to present evidence on his own \nbehalf. He was provided the requisite time to respond to the current SOR and prepare for his \nhearing with any documents that he wanted considered in the adjudication of his clearance, and he \nwas explicitly advised that mitigating evidence would be relevant and material to his case. \nApplicant\u2019s decision to represent himself and his decision as to the quantum of evidence to submit \nwere not due to faulty notice as to his rights. Applicant was not denied the due process afforded \nby the Directive. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nAn applicant is entitled to receive: (a) adequate notice of the reasons the Government \nproposed to deny or revoke access to classified information; (b) a reasonable opportunity to \nrespond to those allegations; (c) a reasonable opportunity to respond to the Government\u2019s \nevidence; and (d) a reasonable opportunity to present evidence on his or her own behalf. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-22163, 2004 WL 794291 at *3 (App. Bd. Mar. 12, 2004).

On \nMarch 21, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) (SEAD 4) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). On February 9, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge Ross D. Hyams denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged that Applicant agreed to harbor two Country A \nnationals, including a 17 year-old, who were to be trafficked from Country A to Country B for the \npurpose of engaging in prostitution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71591 (the federal prohibition of sex \ntrafficking of children). Under Guideline E, this same conduct was cross-alleged.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJanuary 18, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline M (Use of Information Technology), \nGuideline K (Handing Protected Information), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On \nNovember 15, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge \nPamela C. Benson denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant \nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his early 50s and served in the military from 1990 until his honorable \ndischarge in 2011. He has an extensive background in information technology (IT), including \nearning a master\u2019s degree in IT management in 2007 and receiving various other certifications. In \n2014, Applicant was hired by a government contractor as an operations manager, for which he \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nheld a DoD security clearance and one of his responsibilities was to ensure that the company\u2019s IT \noperations ran smoothly. The SOR alleged concerns stemming from this employment, and the \nJudge found against Applicant on the following alleged conduct. \nUnder Guidelines M, K, and E, the SOR cross-alleged three concerns, including that \nApplicant obtained and utilized access to his employer\u2019s network drives, which contained \ncorporate sensitive information and the co-owner\u2019s personal information, and that he did so \nwithout the chief executive officer\u2019s (CEO) approval (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Additionally, without being \ntasked to do so, Applicant gave an outside vendor and personal acquaintance access to his \nemployer\u2019s network and allowed the vendor to install hardware and software devices on the \nnetwork without prior approval and without first obtaining a nondisclosure agreement (SOR \u00b6 1.b). \nFinally, in about January 2015, Applicant downloaded his employer\u2019s propriety company \ninformation, sensitive personal information regarding the company\u2019s owners, and project data \nrelated to one or more government contracts. Later that same month, he saved approximately seven \ngigabytes of data to a personal Dropbox account and then deleted evidence of the activity from his \nwork laptop (SOR \u00b6 1.c). \nUnder Guidelines M and E, the SOR cross-alleged five other IT-related concerns (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d-1.h), including that Applicant: disabled or failed to run virus protection on his work laptop, \nresulting in malware virus infestation of his local profile; and, in violation of his employer\u2019s \npolicies, used his work laptop to download or access pornographic material, disabled or tampered \nwith \u201cHP Protect\u201d security software on his laptop, created multiple user names and passwords \nwithout IT or CEO permission, and installed unauthorized software on his company laptop. \nNoting the deference afforded to a company\u2019s findings and conclusions in its security \ninvestigations, and thereby relying heavily on the employer\u2019s investigative report, the Judge found \nseven Guideline M and K disqualifying conditions applicable1 because \u201cApplicant had access to \nnetwork drives and data that he was not authorized to have access to, he downloaded thousands of \nelectronic files, to include proprietary information files, from his former employer\u2019s network \nwithout authorization, saving it to a personal Dropbox, and then deleting evidence of this activity, \nand he installed and used software on his work laptop without authorization.\u201d Decision at 10, 11 \n(citing ISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \nApplying four Guideline E disqualifying conditions,2 the Judge also found that Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cdemeanor and testimony lacked credibility,\u201d that \u201cthe inconsistencies between his testimony and \nthe other evidence in the record further undermined his credibility,\u201d and that his \u201cbehavior could \naffect his personal, professional, and community standing.\u201d Decision at 14. The Judge concluded \nthat, despite the passage of time, Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his \nconduct, which included serious security infractions and a lack of remorse. \n1 AG \u00b6\u00b6 34(b), 34(c), 34(g), 40(c), 40(d), 40(e), and 40(f). \n2 AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d), 16(e), and 16(f). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant reiterates his objection to a Government witness, challenges the \nJudge\u2019s factual findings, and argues that the Judge failed to properly consider his favorable \ncharacter evidence and the Whole-Person Concept. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the \nJudge\u2019s decision. \nChallenge to Government\u2019s Witness \nDuring his security clearance hearing, Applicant raised a concern about the Government\u2019s \nwitness (\u201cMr. Z\u201d), who worked as a subcontractor for Applicant\u2019s employer during the time of the \nevents alleged in the SOR. Tr. at 18-19. In response to his concerns, the Judge confirmed that \nApplicant would have the opportunity to cross-examine Mr. Z, at which time he could address the \nwitness\u2019s credibility. Id. at 19. On appeal, Applicant renews his challenge to Mr. Z\u2019s testimony on \nthe basis that \u201che was not an employee, worked (moonlighted) for a significant competitor, posed \na Conflict of Interest on multiple awarded and proposed contracts and business development \nopportunities and was regularly negligent in his duties as cited by multiple employees during \n[Applicant\u2019s] tenure.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. \nThe DOHA process encourages judges to err on the side of initially admitting evidence \ninto the record, and then to consider a party\u2019s objections when deciding what, if any, weight to \ngive to that evidence. See ISCR Case 07-07635 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 22, 2008). We find no error \nin the Judge\u2019s decision to allow Mr. Z\u2019s testimony, subject to Applicant\u2019s ability to cross-examine \nhim, and subsequently determine what weight should be afforded that evidence. \nTo that end, it is well-established that \u201c[d]etermining the weight and credibility of the \nevidence is the special province of the trier of fact.\u201d Inwood Labs., Inc. v. Ives Labs., Inc., 456 \nU.S. 844, 856 (1982). While the Judge had to consider Applicant\u2019s testimony and explanation for \nthe concerns alleged in the SOR, she was not bound by it. Indeed, it would be arbitrary and \ncapricious to uncritically accept witness testimony without considering whether it is plausible and \nconsistent with other evidence. See ISCR Case No. 01-07292 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 29, 2004) (citation \nomitted). Rather, a judge must weigh the evidence and resolve conflicts based upon a careful \nevaluation of factors such as the evidence\u2019s \u201ccomparative reliability, plausibility and ultimate \ntruthfulness.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-06723 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2007). \nAt hearing, Applicant cross-examined Mr. Z about the dates and method of Applicant\u2019s \nhaving system administrator access and the propriety of Applicant formatting his hard drive and \nusing Dropbox to copy files. See Tr. at 131-140. He declined, however, to question Mr. Z about \nmost of the concerns raised at hearing and on appeal, including Mr. Z\u2019s alleged work for a \ncompetitor, conflicts of interest, and negligence. While Applicant attempted to impeach Mr. Z\u2019s \nknowledge of company operations and the propriety of Applicant\u2019s actions by highlighting that \nMr. Z did not work on-site and was not part of the company\u2019s daily operations, Mr. Z consistently \nresponded to Applicant\u2019s questions with the basis of his knowledge: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMR. Z: And who allowed you to use Dropbox? Who had knowledge \nof this? I didn\u2019t. \nAPPLICANT: Well, you\u2019re not an onsite person, number one. \nYou\u2019re also not an employee of the company, number two. So, the \nfact that you didn\u2019t know is not abnormal to me. You\u2019re not an \nemployee of [the company]. How would you know that? \nMR. Z: Because I manage all the rights, and permissions, and access \nfor the data on the network. You would, you had accounts in \nSharepoint. You had accounts for the VPN to use to access data. So \nof course I knew. \nAPPLICANT: Yes, but you aren\u2019t part of the daily operations of [the \ncompany], and you don\u2019t know what we talked about. You\u2019re only \nasserting these things because of your professional opinion, which I \ndon\u2019t doubt. But normal operating policy and discussions between \nownership and me, as the operations manager, you had no idea \nabout. So, whether I was using Dropbox with their consent or not, \nyou really don\u2019t know that. \nMR. Z: Well, we know it was without their consent because the \ncompany policy was not to use Dropbox, especially for government \ndata. It was to use the two access methods we gave. That\u2019s clear. \nId. at 137-138. Here, when weighed against Mr. Z\u2019s testimony, the company\u2019s investigation report, \nand Applicant\u2019s inconsistent explanations, the Judge reasonably found Applicant\u2019s testimony less \ncredible. We find no reason not to give deference to the Judge\u2019s weighing of this evidence. \nChallenge to Factual Findings \nApplicant next challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he retired from the military in 2011 at \nthe rank of staff sergeant, averring instead that he \u201cretired as a Captain, unrestricted officer.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 2. Our review of the record reflects that Applicant achieved a final enlisted rank \nof staff sergeant in 1998 before being commissioned, but that he had achieved the rank of captain \nat the time of his 2011 military retirement. See Tr. at 12; Government Exhibit (GE) 1 at 18. While \nthe Judge\u2019s finding about Applicant\u2019s rank upon retirement is incorrect, the error was harmless \nbecause it did not likely affect the outcome of the case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-01846 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2011). \nChallenge to Weighing of Evidence \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s challenges to the Judge\u2019s findings generally advocate for an \nalternative weighing of the evidence, which is not enough to show that the Judge weighed the \nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

Oct. 12, 2007). For example, Applicant argues that \nMr. Z testified falsely that he did not grant Applicant system administrator access. Applicant \ncontends that his system administrator access was \u201capproved by [his] supervisor and CEO . . . and \nperformed by [Mr. Z].\u201d Appeal Brief at 4. \nDuring cross-examination, Applicant asked Mr. Z several times to confirm when Applicant \nwas granted system administrator access. See, e.g., Tr. at 131-132.3 In response, Mr. Z consistently \nexplained that, to his knowledge, Applicant was never directly granted system administrator \naccess, but instead only had access to a temporary user account that was established to enable a \nvendor\u2019s work. Specifically, Mr. Z responded to Applicant\u2019s questions by stating: \nYou had access via that temporary account that was only to be used \nby [the vendor], to collect network data from the network, correct? \n. . . I never assigned you system administrator access. Only via the \ntemporary account did you have access. Not assigned. You were not \nassigned any privileges for administrator on the network. . . . You \nhad access to an account that had domain admin rights, but they \nweren\u2019t assigned to you. \nTr. at 134. Mr. Z\u2019s testimony is consistent with other record evidence that reflects that Applicant \nplanned to work with a vendor to conduct an audit of the company\u2019s IT services, for which he \nwould provide the vendor with network administrator rights. In May 2014, based on this request, \nApplicant was told that the company would \u201ccreate a new temporary account with domain admin \nrights,\u201d and he was provided the temporary account\u2019s domain information and password. GE 4 at \n44-46. In August 2014, months after the vendor\u2019s project was complete and while still having \naccess, Applicant commented to the security manager that he possessed all of the company\u2019s data. \nGE 5 at 2. Applicant continued to have access to the temporary account until late September 2014, \nwhen another employee realized the extent of Applicant\u2019s access and notified the company\u2019s \nsecurity manager, who immediately sought to have Applicant removed from any administrative \naccess.

At hearing, however, he testified that he emailed the company\u2019s \nco-owner, copying the CEO, to request system administrator access, which was granted in about \nJune 2014 in order to perform a network assessment. He admitted that the access gave him \nadmittance to the owners\u2019 personal information and any company proprietary information that was \nsaved on any of the network drives, but denied the SOR allegation because he did not use or take \nany proprietary or sensitive information. \n3 Applicant appears to contend that being given the passwords to access a temporary user account with system \nadministrator rights is the same as being granted system administrator rights directly. Regardless of Applicant\u2019s \nsplitting of hairs, however, the record supports that said access was afforded for a limited purpose and a limited \ntimeframe, both of which Applicant knowingly exceeded. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge weighed Applicant\u2019s various explanations \u2013 which she found to be inconsistent \nand ultimately detracted from his credibility \u2013 against other record evidence regarding Applicant\u2019s \nsystem administrator access and reasonably concluded that \u201cApplicant had access to network \ndrives and data that he was not authorized to have access to.\u201d Decision at 10. This and the \nremainder of Applicant\u2019s challenges to the Judge\u2019s findings fail to establish any harmful error. The \nJudge\u2019s material findings of security concern are \u201cbased upon substantial evidence or constitute \nreasonable inferences or conclusions that could be drawn from the evidence,\u201d and Applicant has \ncited to no harmful error in the Judge\u2019s findings. ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, \n2014). \nChallenge to Applicant\u2019s Witness Testimony and Charge of Bias \nApplicant also argues that the Judge was provided a biased and one-sided case file and \ncontends that his witness (\u201cMr. P\u201d) \u201cwas not asked any questions or allowed to address any of the \naccusations presented in this hearing,\u201d despite purportedly having a similar experience departing \nfrom the company. Appeal Brief at 5. As an initial matter, Applicant\u2019s claim that Mr. P was not \n\u201callowed\u201d to address any of the accusations is baseless. At no point during the hearing did the \nJudge limit the scope of Mr. P\u2019s testimony. Rather, the transcript reflects that Applicant introduced \nhis witness by noting that \u201chis time at [the company] and the ending of it is coincidentally very \nsimilar. Same allegations, same problems, same all of that stuff. . . . I think his opinion is extremely \nimportant here.\u201d Tr. at 79. Applicant thereafter asked Mr. P to address several topics, which he \ndid, including Mr. P\u2019s experience exiting the company. Id. at 81, 87. Throughout the witness\u2019s \ntestimony, the Judge engaged in follow-up questions before turning the questioning back over to \nApplicant. When afforded an opportunity to ask Mr. P any final questions, Applicant asserted that \nhe had none. Id. at 89. The record reflects that Applicant\u2019s witness was permitted to fully testify \nto the extent sought by Applicant. \nApplicant also contends that \u201cthis process does not allow testimony . . . from other \nwitnesses,\u201d which \u201cdemonstrates a lack of evidence and confidence in this case.\u201d Appeal Brief at \n6. Contrary to this assertion, witnesses may be presented by either party in security clearance \nhearings. Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14, E3.1.15. To the extent that Applicant is arguing that the Judge and \nGovernment failed to call additional specific witnesses on Applicant\u2019s behalf or to sufficiently \nquestion Applicant\u2019s witness, this challenge is without merit. Once the Government has met its \nburden of establishing controverted facts, the burden shifts to the applicant to present witnesses \nand other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate established facts. Id. It is neither the \njudge\u2019s nor the Government\u2019s duty to seek additional mitigating evidence or undertake further \ninvestigation of the concerns raised in an SOR. See ISCR Case No. 15-08885 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. \n21, 2017). Rather, the applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \nclearance decision. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The record in this case does not support that Applicant \nwas prevented from offering favorable evidence from any individual, either through live testimony \nor reference letters. \nFinally, Applicant contends that the Government\u2019s decision to not interview, call, or \nquestion his \u201cactual supervisor\u201d is indicative of bias on the part of the Judge, Government counsel, \nand the CEO \u201cto hide the truth and present a story that is one-sided.\u201d Appeal Brief at 4-5. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s claim that the Judge evinced bias against him appears entirely based on the foregoing, \nunsubstantiated allegations that Applicant\u2019s ability to develop favorable record evidence was \nimpeded. An appealing party has a heavy burden of demonstrating conduct by a judge that deprived \nthe hearing or decision of fairness and impartiality. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 94-0282, 1995 WL \n272062 at *3 (App. Bd. Feb. 21, 1995) (citations omitted). For the reasons discussed above, we \nfind nothing in the record to support that the Judge impeded Applicant\u2019s ability to develop his case \nthrough witness testimony or that would likely persuade a reasonable person that the Judge was \nlacking in the requisite impartiality. \nIn conclusion, Applicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our \nreview of the record reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard \nis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

On February 6, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe Judge found favorably for Applicant on the allegations under Guidelines B, I, and K. \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR cross-alleged the Guideline K conduct and alleged 14 instances in \nwhich Applicant failed to disclose information or provided false information to his military unit, \nin his security clearance application (SCA), or in background investigation interviews.

Consistent with the following, \nwe affirm. \nApplicant is in his early fifties. He served in the U.S. Navy for twenty years and retired in \n2013. The Guideline E falsifications relate to three events that took place in his final years on \nactive duty: his relationship and subsequent marriage to a foreign national; his storage of \nsensitive government information on a personal computer; and his hospitalizations for mental \nhealth issues. In 2010, Applicant met Ms. G while he was in Peru, of which she was a citizen and \nresident. He traveled to Peru to visit Ms. G on several occasions and married her in March 2012. \nAlthough they later became estranged at a date uncertain, Applicant and Ms. G never divorced. \nRegarding this relationship, Applicant is alleged to have committed ten falsifications, to include: \nfailing to disclose his relationship with a foreign national and related travel to his military unit; \nlying to his unit by denying that he traveled to get married; lying to a Naval Criminal \nInvestigative Service (NCIS) agent by falsely alleging that he was being extorted by Ms. G; \nfalsifying his 2018 SCA by not disclosing his 2012 marriage, his financial support for a foreign \nnational, and his foreign travel; and lying to a background investigator in 2018 about his \nrelationship with Ms. G, his 2012 marriage, and related foreign travel. \nTurning to the second event \u2013 in 2012, Applicant was questioned by NCIS about having \nimproperly stored sensitive aircraft information on his personal computer. In his interview with \nthe NCIS agent, Applicant confirmed that the stored information was\u2013at a minimum\u2013sensitive \nand that he had left his personal laptop in the custody of a foreign national. The SOR alleges that \nApplicant falsified facts during an interview with his security clearance background investigator \nin which he denied having ever been suspected or accused of the improper handling of sensitive \nor classified information. At hearing, Applicant stated that he was sent to a summary court \nmartial for this matter but was acquitted. \nTurning to the third event \u2013 in November 2012, Applicant was involuntarily hospitalized \nfor mental health treatment for about two weeks. He also received mental health treatment in \nJanuary 2013. The SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his 2018 SCA by failing to disclose the \ntreatment and falsified his background interview by denying the involuntary hospitalization. \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose or provided false info \nabout the issues detailed above, as alleged in the SOR. Decision at 17. Additionally, the Judge \nfound that Applicant lied at his hearing about whether he had sensitive military information on \nhis personal laptop and about whether he informed his command about his trips to Peru, but the \nJudge noted that he would consider this non-alleged conduct only for the limited purposes \npermitted under Appeal Board precedent (e.g., assessing credibility, considering whether an \napplicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation).

[Decision at 19.] \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s credibility determination\u2014specifically the \n\u201cstatement that I was dishonest during the hearing.\u201d Applicant argues that he \u201cfind[s] no \ninformation supporting this claim in any of Judge Harvey\u2019s records provided in the final \nfinding.\u201d Appeal Brief (AB) at 1. Based on our review of the record and decision, we find no \nreason to disturb the Judge\u2019s adverse credibility assessment. \nThe Directive requires the Appeal Board to give deference to a judge\u2019s credibility \ndeterminations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. Upon his review of the evidence in this case\u2014to include \nApplicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing\u2014the Judge made several conclusions that reflect on \nApplicant\u2019s credibility. First, he concluded that\u2014as alleged in the SOR\u2014Applicant had \ndeliberately provided false information or omitted information to his military unit or security \nofficials in thirteen separate instances. Additionally, the Judge found that Applicant lied at his \nhearing \u201cwhen he falsely claimed he did not have sensitive Navy information on the computer\u201d \nand that he \u201calso lied at his hearing when he said he informed his command about his trips to \nPeru.\u201d Decision at 18. Those credibility determinations are well within the Judge\u2019s authority and \nwell supported by the evidence of record. The Judge had the opportunity to observe Applicant\u2019s \ndemeanor during his hearing testimony, assess the credibility of Applicant\u2019s testimony on these \nmatters, and weigh Applicant\u2019s explanations and denials of wrongdoing in light of the record \nevidence. On appeal, a party challenging the resulting credibility determination has a heavy \nburden of persuasion, and Applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s negative assessment of his \ncredibility is not sufficient to meet his heavy burden. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-05072 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2005). \nApplicant also argues that the Judge did not consider or give appropriate weight to some \nof his mitigation evidence, in particular the fact that he was acquitted of all charges at his 2013 \nsummary court-martial, that he \u201cretired honorably at the end of April that year with 20 years of \nservice,\u201d and that he has \u201cworked tirelessly and without any incident\u201d at his current job for over \nfive and a half years. AB at 1\u20132. The Judge\u2019s decision, however, reflects that he thoroughly \nreviewed all evidence presented, and we note that he finds favorably on several allegations based \non evidence presented by Applicant. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, \nthe Judge complied with the requirements of the Directive in his whole-person analysis by \nconsidering all evidence of record in reaching his decision.  \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he \nshould be granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated \na satisfactory explanation for the decision.

On December 11, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative \nJudge Braden M. Murphy denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant is in his mid-40s and is married with two teenaged children. He served in the \nmilitary for over 19 years, at which time he was administratively separated with a general discharge \nunder honorable conditions as a result of the commission of a serious offense. The underlying \nmisconduct stemmed from an incident in which Applicant was alleged to have made inappropriate \nsexual comments to a female Sailor and touched her breast. Those allegations were investigated \nby the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. Government Exhibit 6.

Those findings were upheld on appeal. Government Exhibit 5. This conduct formed the \nbasis for the Guideline D and Guideline E allegations in the SOR. Applicant admits to having \nmade inappropriate comments but denies the sexual contact. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged seven delinquent debts totaling approximately \n$32,000. Applicant avers that these delinquencies accrued while he was under the financial strain \nresulting from his discharge from the military and that he is making progress towards resolving \nthem. \nThe Judge found against Applicant as to the Guidelines D, F, and J allegations but \nconcluded that the Guideline E allegation was duplicative. \nOn appeal, Applicant reiterates the arguments he made at hearing but does not make any \nspecific allegation of harmful error. The Appeal Board does not review cases de novo and is \nprohibited from considering new evidence on appeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. In essence, Applicant \nis advocating for an alternative weighing of the evidence. An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the \njudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence \nis not sufficient to demonstrate the judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner \nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

Applicant requested a hearing. On December 26, \n2023, after the record closed, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge \nCharles C. Hale denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleges various charges, arrests, and criminal convictions \nbetween 2015 and 2018.

Allegations under Guidelines J and F were cross alleged under Guideline E. Applicant \nadmitted all of the Guideline J and F allegations with explanations, but he did not answer the \nGuideline E SOR allegation. The Judge found in favor of Applicant on two criminal allegations \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d) and on the alimony debt allegation (SOR \u00b6 2.g), and against him on the \nremaining SOR allegations. The favorable findings will not be discussed herein. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, who is in his late sixties, holds two bachelor\u2019s degrees. He married in 1981, \nseparated in 2015, and divorced in 2020. The couple has one child, now in her thirties, who has \ndevelopmental issues. Applicant remarried a citizen of another country in 2021 and has a stepchild \nfrom this marriage. His wife resides in a property he owns in another country, and he spends about \nhalf of his time there. Applicant held a security clearance for about 30 years until it lapsed in 2018. \nApplicant was convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) in August 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). \nHe was convicted in 2017 for driving on a suspended license. He claimed his ignition interlock \ndevice was not working reliably so he decided to take a period of license suspension in its place. \nHe failed to submit evidence of such, but also admitted to driving with his suspended license (SOR \n\u00b6 1.c). In 2018, he was charged with felony fraud and received probation before judgment. He \nexplained that he entered an Alford plea and received a fine, community service, and an agreement \nthat the matter would be expunged from his record. (SOR \u00b6 1.e.) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant filed five bankruptcy petitions. Three \nwere dismissed, and two resulted in discharges in 2005 and 2018 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b - 2.e). Applicant \nnoted that he was granted a security clearance in 2005 with a bankruptcy on his record. He said \nthat he used Chapter 7 bankruptcy to clear some debts. Applicant explained that when his wife left \ntheir home in 2015, she \u201cdumped\u201d all financial reasonability on him and refused to work, so he \npursued bankruptcy to put them in the best financial position. He testified that \u201cafter the marriage \nand the relationship was gone, I just said to hell with everything. I\u2019m going to let everything go \nand move on with my life and establish a new life for myself.\u201d Decision at 2; Tr. at 80, 81. \nIn two court actions, Applicant was ordered to pay over $168,000, including a judgment \nfor $72,600 for wrongfully converting funds held for his disabled adult daughter (SOR \u00b6 2.f). He \nadmitted to comingling her accounts with his investment accounts, which sustained losses he could \nnot cover. He testified that he never provided the court with \u201ca sufficient explanation, and I can\u2019t \nprovide a sufficient explanation here today.\u201d Decision at 4; Tr. at 96. Applicant is repaying the \nalimony arrears alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.g, in accordance with the divorce decree and court order. \nDespite his history of financial difficulties, he provided about $54,000 in financial support to \nforeign nationals he dated between 2015 and 2020 (SOR \u00b6 2.h). \nApplicant attributed the SOR allegations directly or indirectly to events surrounding his \ndivorce from his wife of 34 years. He described the divorce as a \u201cfive-year acrimonious, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndestructive, intense, bitter, and litigious divorce.\u201d Decision at 4; Tr. at 14. He testified to his \nchanged circumstances and happy marriage. Decision at 4; Answer; Tr. at 102. \nWith respect to the criminal allegations under Guideline J, the Judge found for Applicant \non an allegation that he was charged with domestic violence and an allegation that a warrant was \nissued for his arrest. On the remaining allegations, the Judge acknowledged the stress of \nApplicant\u2019s divorce and the passage of time since his last criminal incident in 2018, but \nnevertheless held that no mitigation applies as his \u201cconduct demonstrates his willingness to act for \nhis own benefit despite the illegality of his conduct.\u201d  Decision at 6. \nUnder Guideline F, the Judge held that, except for the delinquent alimony allegation, no \nmitigating conditions applied because \u201cApplicant\u2019s financial problems are recent and ongoing and \nhave recurred over a long period of time.\u201d Id. at 8. Although his compliance with court orders is \n\u201cpositive information,\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of debt and bankruptcy makes it too soon to conclude \nthat his financial problems are under control. Id. Additionally, despite Applicant\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s \nexcessive spending and divorce, Applicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances given \nhis actions involving his daughter\u2019s account and his financial support for foreign nationals. \nApplicant\u2019s repeated resort to bankruptcy protection does not constitute responsible action and \ndoes not support his claim that he initiated prompt, good-faith efforts to pay or otherwise resolve \nhis debts. Applicant did not show that he embarked on a systematic, reliable effort to improve his \nfinancial management in a way that inspires confidence that he will not experience financial \nproblems in the future given his actions involving his daughter and financial support for foreign \nnationals. Id. \nUnder Guideline E, the Judge held that \u201cApplicant\u2019s repeated instances of criminal conduct \nover the past seven years, and his lack of discretion in handling his finances and the use of his \ndisabled daughter\u2019s financial account as a means to resolve his financial challenges undermine \nconfidence in [his] judgment.\u201d His breach of his obligation to his daughter and long history of poor \nmanagement of his personal finances remain a security concern and, in addition to his criminal \nconduct, relate to a broader concern about his poor judgment and inability or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and procedures. Id. at 9. In his whole person analysis, the Judge incorporated his \nfindings and conclusions under Guidelines J, F, and E. \nDiscussion \nApplicant argues that the Judge erred in misstating facts and failed to comply with the \nDirective by not properly weighing the evidence, mitigating conditions, and Whole-Person \nConcept. We turn first to his argument that the Judge erred in his findings of fact. Applicant \ncontends that he holds a master\u2019s degree and a bachelor\u2019s degree, rather than two bachelor\u2019s \ndegrees as noted by the Judge. Any error in this regard is harmless as it constitutes background \ninformation and did not weigh unfavorably on the Judge\u2019s evaluation of the evidence. \nApplicant next challenges the Judge\u2019s statement that Applicant \u201cacknowledges he was \nconvicted of felony fraud,\u201d arguing that he was never convicted of fraud and never acknowledged \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe same. This comment by the Judge was in the context of a discussion regarding a warrant for \nApplicant\u2019s arrest (SOR \u00b6 1.d.), and we note that the Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor on this \nallegation. In discussing the allegation of felony fraud (SOR \u00b6 1.e.), the Judge found facts that are \namply supported by the record and undisputed by Applicant: \u201cApplicant was charged with felony \nfraud and received probation before judgment. He explained that he entered an Alford plea and \nreceived a fine, community service, and an agreement that the matter would be expunged from his \nrecord.\u201d Id. at 3. To the extent that the Judge may have mis-stated a fact in his discussion of SOR \n\u00b6 1.d., we conclude that any error is harmless as not outcome-dispositive. Additionally, Applicant \nargues that the Judge erred with regard to facts concerning whether Applicant had an interlock \ndevice removed from his car. It appears that Applicant misread the Judge\u2019s decision. The record \nsupports the Judge\u2019s findings on this collateral issue. \nIn his final argument of the Judge\u2019s findings, Applicant argues that he is not a criminal, \nthat he has never engaged in criminal activity, and that his record is clean. However, the record \nevidence shows that Applicant has a history of criminal conduct, with the last criminal charge \u2014 \na felony \u2014 occurring in 2018 and resulting in an Alford1 plea, probation before judgment, a fine, \nand community service.2 \nApplicant also argues that he previously held security clearances, that his SOR \ntransgressions happened because of his divorce, that he was a respected member of his community \nbefore the divorce, and that he has since reestablished his life and finances. Appeal Brief (AB) at \n1\u20133. These arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which \nis not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a \nmanner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 12, 2007). Possession of a previously granted clearance does not give rise to any right or \nvested interest, nor does any favorable clearance decision preclude the Government from \nreassessing a person\u2019s security eligibility in light of current circumstances. ISCR Case No. 03\u00ad\n24144 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 6, 2005). \nFinally, Applicant supplemented the record with additional evidence of his financial status \nand argues that he complied with the clearance process, pointing to his personal subject interview \n(PSI) \u201cconclusion\u201d that \u201cnothing in his (my) background or lifestyle that would allow me to be \nblackmailed or coerced in any way, domestic incidents, financial condition, foreign travel issues, \n\u2026 etc.\u201d AB at 4. The Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29. With respect to Applicant\u2019s PSI summary, we note that the investigating \nofficer\u2019s comments summarize Applicant\u2019s answers during the interview.

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMarch 2, 2022, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On \nSeptember 23, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Nichole L. \nNoel granted Applicant security clearance eligibility. The Government appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nAs originally issued, the SOR alleged eight delinquent debts. In her May 2022 response to \nthe SOR, Applicant denied six debts as paid and admitted the remaining two, representing that she \nwas current on payment plans. In August 2022, the Government amended the SOR to allege that \nApplicant\u2019s excessive gambling contributed to the ongoing nature of the alleged delinquencies. \nApplicant denied this additional allegation. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s findings are summarized and quoted below. \nApplicant is in her mid-sixties and has held a security clearance intermittently since 1980, \nboth as a member of the Reserve force from 1994 through 2001 and in various contractor jobs. She \nobtained a security clearance from another federal agency in 2016. Anticipating a position with a \ndifferent contractor, Applicant completed a new security clearance application in July 2019. \nAlthough Applicant disclosed no adverse financial information, the background investigation \nrevealed the alleged delinquent debts, which totaled approximately $71,600.  \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a represents the overpayment of benefits from another federal \nagency. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.h arose from a series of significant life events \nthat began in 2016. Prior to that timeframe, Applicant earned a significant salary and \u201clived a \nluxurious lifestyle.\u201d Decision at 4. In 2016, Applicant unexpectedly assumed custody of an infant \ngrandchild, requiring that she return from her overseas assignment on a federal contract, work in \nthe United States, and cover expenses for her grandchild. During the same time, Applicant assumed \ncaregiver responsibilities for her parents, both of whom had serious illnesses. Applicant relied on \nthe credit cards at issue in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f to pay expenses for her granddaughter and parents. \nFollowing her parents\u2019 deaths in 2017 and 2018, Applicant became the executor of their \nestate, paid their burial expenses, and assumed some of their debt. Although she inherited one of \nher parents\u2019 homes, Applicant discovered that it was encumbered by a $190,000 loan that a sibling \nhad taken against the property. In late 2018, Applicant learned that her primary residence required \nsignificant repairs, which she funded in part by borrowing $14,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). \nIn July 2019, the federal contract that Applicant was working on ended three months early. \nUnemployed for two months, Applicant lived off her savings and could only pay the minimum \namount due on her credit cards. In August 2019, Applicant hired a debt consolidation company but \nadmittedly failed to research the company she chose or the service it purportedly provided. After \nshe was sued in February 2020 for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, Applicant belatedly realized that \nthe company was not using her monthly payments to satisfy her debts but instead allowing the \ndebts to lapse into delinquent status prior to initiating settlement negotiations. Applicant canceled \nthe servicing agreement in February 2020 and began to perform additional contract work in order to \nresolve the debts on her own. \nWhen the DoD background investigation began in late 2020, all the debts alleged in the \nSOR were reported as delinquent. Prior to the SOR being issued in March 2022, Applicant paid \noff over $30,000 in debt. In September 2021, she sold the home she inherited from her parents, \npaid the loan on the property, and used some of the remaining proceeds to resolve delinquent debts. \nBetween 2021 and 2022, Applicant resolved SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.h, and she resolved SOR \u00b6 1.c \nin 2023. In May 2022, Applicant entered a payment plan of $145 per month for the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.b, and she has reduced the debt by $4,000. In June 2022, Applicant entered into a \nrepayment plan of $350 per month for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and she has reduced the debt \nfrom $18,000 to $11,000. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRegarding the final allegation \u2013 that excessive gambling between February 2021 and June \n2022 contributed to Applicant\u2019s ongoing financial delinquencies \u2013 the Judge stated: \nApplicant used online gaming as her entertainment when the \nCOVID19 pandemic restricted her movements. The game platform, \nwhich is advertised as a \u2018social casino,\u2019 allowed her to socialize with \nother people as she played. She budgeted $2,500 each month to \ngaming. She testified that some months, she spent less than the \nbudgeted amount and some months she spent more. The game also \npaid out cash prizes. \nApplicant denies that her online gaming constituted gambling. She \nalso denies that her gaming affected her ability to resolve her \ndelinquent accounts or her ability to repay her recurring financial \nobligations. The bank statements in the record provide detail about \nApplicant\u2019s gaming expenditures and her debt, which are \nsummarized as follows: \nStatement Date \nGame Spending \nDebt Payments \nFebruary to March 2021 \n$9,300 \n$17,524 \nMarch 2021 to April 2021 \n$3,800 \n$5,740 \nJune 2021 to July 2021 \n$4,500 \n$600 \nMay 2022 to June 2022 \n$1,700 \n$1,538 \nTotal \n$19,300 \n$25,402 \nThe record contains no evidence of Applicant engaging in online \ngaming since June 2022. In April 2023, she purchased a home. \nSince the hearing, she also paid off $20,000 in other non-delinquent \ndebt. The most recent personal financial statement in the record \nshows that Applicant has $1.3 million dollars in assets and $200,000 \nin debt, which includes two home mortgages that are in good \nstanding, a car payment, and balances on the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. [Decision at 5\u20136 (internal cites omitted)]. \nJudge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is summarized and quoted below. \nThe Judge found that the record established the following disqualifying conditions: AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), 19(c), 19 (e), and 19(i).1 Regarding the gambling allegation, however, the Judge noted that \n\u201c[t]he activities that constitute gambling and the type of entity that constitutes a casino are defined \nby federal and state statutes.\u201d Decision at 7. Because those definitions were \u201cnot in the record,\u201d \nthe Judge concluded that she could not make \u201ca specific finding about whether or not Applicant\u2019s \n1 AG \u00b6\u00b6 19: (a) an inability to satisfy debts; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; (e) consistent spending \nbeyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or irresponsible spending, which may be indicated excessive indebtedness, \nsignificant negative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non\u00adpayment or other negative financial indicators; \nand (i) concealing gambling losses, family conflict, or other problems caused by gambling. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbehavior constituted gambling\u201d and resolved the gambling allegation in Applicant\u2019s favor. Id. \nNevertheless, the Judge acknowledged that the record raised questions as to: (1) whether \nApplicant\u2019s spending habits caused or exacerbated her financial problems; and (2) whether her \nfinancial habits raised concerns about her current security worthiness. Resolving these questions \nfavorably for Applicant, the Judge found: \nApplicant earned sufficient income to support her chosen \nrecreational activity. Being a clearance holder does not require an \nindividual to forego entertainment or luxury, even in the midst of \nrepaying delinquent debt. Security clearance adjudications are not \ndebt collection proceedings. Rather the purpose of the adjudication \nis to make \u201can examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life \nto make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable \nsecurity risk.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(a)) While Applicant could have resolved her \ndebt sooner if she applied all of her excess income to her debts, there \nis no requirement that she do so. She is not required to be a model \nof financial perfection or restraint. [Id. at 7\u20138.] \nThe Judge summarized the case in mitigation as follows: \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by events beyond her \ncontrol, a series of family events, which are unlikely to recur, that \ngenerated significant unexpected expenses. She acted responsibly \nto resolve the debts. Applicant developed a plan for resolving her \ndebt and executed that plan. Acting in good faith, she paid a debt \nrelief service almost $12,000, with the expectation that the servicing \ncompany would help her regain control of her financial situation. \u2026 \nWhen that plan failed, she began working extra jobs to earn the \nadditional income needed to resolve her debts. Doing so, she \nresolved over $120,000 in debt, including six of the eight delinquent \naccounts alleged in the SOR. She also has ongoing payment plans \nfor the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. The circumstances under \nwhich Applicant incurred the debt do not reflect negatively on her \ncurrent security worthiness. The most recent financial records do not \nshow any indication of ongoing financial issues. [Id. at 8.] \nDiscussion \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After \nthe Government produces evidence raising security concerns, an applicant bears the burden of \npersuasion concerning mitigation. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security \nclearance decisions is that \u201ca clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the \ninterests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Dep\u2019t of the Navy v.

When a judge\u2019s factual findings are \nchallenged, the Board must determine whether \u201c[t]he Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact are \nsupported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a \nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \u201cThe \nBoard must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a judge\u2019s findings, but \nalso whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those \nfindings, and whether the judge\u2019s findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence \nas a whole.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2005). A judge\u2019s decision can be \nfound to be arbitrary or capricious if \u201cit does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts and \nthe choice made; [it] does not consider relevant factors; [it] reflects a clear error of judgment; it \nfails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs \ncontrary to the record evidence; or [it] is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere \ndifference of opinion.\u201d ISCR Case No. 95-0600, 1996 WL 480993 at *3 (App. Bd. May 16, 1996) \n(citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)) As \ndetailed below, the Judge\u2019s findings do not reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record \nevidence, fatally compromising her mitigation analysis as she failed to examine relevant evidence \nand to consider important aspects of the case. \nFactual Findings \nThe Government\u2019s initial argument regarding the Judge\u2019s factual findings is that she erred \nin refusing to find that Applicant\u2019s activity on Chumba Casino, an online sweepstakes casino, \nconstituted \u201cgambling\u201d within the meaning of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(h) and (i).2 At hearing, Applicant denied \nthat she gambled and instead characterized her online activities as \u201cgaming.\u201d Invoking a dictionary \ndefinition, the Government argues that \u201cApplicant\u2019s behavior of paying money towards various \nChumba Casino\u2019s online games, for which she would occasionally win money or other items of \nvalue, clearly falls within the definition of gambling.\u201d Appeal Brief at 10. The Government asserts \nthat the Judge could simply have taken administrative notice of pertinent statutes or, alternatively, \nfound that \u201cthe clear language of the Directive does not require that a particular statute be \nconsidered in determining whether Applicant\u2019s behavior constituted gambling.\u201d Id. \nThese arguments are of mixed merit. First with respect to the administrative notice \nargument, the record before the Judge and now before us is fairly opaque as to what exactly \nChumba Casino is, how it operates, and how one plays the various games.

Post-hearing, the Government supplemented the record with FAQs from Chumba Casino\u2019s \nwebsite, which provide some broad details about how this sweepstakes casino operates but appear \nlargely intended to address the legality of the games. Government Exhibit (GE) 11. That leads to \nthe second problem with the Government\u2019s argument. The legal status of sweepstakes casinos \nunder federal and state law has recently drawn attention from regulators, the casino industry, and \nsome state legislatures because of the very question that the Government is arguing \u2013 whether they \nshould be categorized as online gambling. Sweepstakes casinos such as Chumba Casino are \napparently structured in a manner that evades definition as \u201cgambling\u201d under federal and state law, \nallowing them both to operate outside the regulations that govern the casino industry and to operate \nin states that prohibit online gambling. Rick Maese, The \u2018Sweepstakes\u2019 Games That Look a Lot \nLike \nOnline \nGambling, \nWash. \nPost, \n(Nov. \n27, \n2024), \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/11/27/social-casino-sweeps-chumba/. \nNotably, \nApplicant was legally playing the sweepstakes casino in a state that prohibits online casino \ngambling, undercutting the Government\u2019s argument that her online activities \u201cclearly fall within \nthe definition of gambling,\u201d at least in terms of falling within a legal definition. Appeal Brief at \n10. The Government\u2019s argument that the Judge could simply have found the governing federal or \nstate statutes and taken administrative notice is therefore misplaced, as there are no such statutes \nto be found. \nArguably, the Government\u2019s alternative argument could prevail\u2014that it does not matter \nwhether an activity constitutes gambling under a particular statute as Applicant\u2019s activity on \nChumba Casino falls within \u201cthe clear language\u201d of AG \u00b6 19. We note that the IRS appears to \nadopt this broader view, as its requirement that one report \u201cgambling income\u201d includes income \nfrom various games of chance that would not necessarily meet the legal definition of gambling. \nGE 14. Said differently, Applicant\u2019s winnings from Chumba Casino are within the definition of \n\u201cgambling income\u201d established by the IRS, despite being earned in a venue that is not recognized \nas a gambling entity for other regulatory purposes. \nAs a practical matter, however, we do not need to resolve the thorny issue of whether \nApplicant\u2019s activities on Chumba Casino amount to gambling, an issue clouded both by the state \nof the record and the state of the law, as Applicant\u2019s activities, whether they constitute gambling \nor gaming, are well-captured by AG \u00b6 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous \nor irresponsible spending.\u201d The Judge found that AG \u00b6 19(e) applied, a finding that is amply \nsupported by the record, but then determined the concern to be mitigated, an error we address in \nthe mitigation section below. \nAlthough the Government\u2019s argument regarding the Judge\u2019s finding on gambling is of \nmixed merit, their arguments about two other factual findings are well-grounded and persuasive. \nFirst, the Government challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that the \u201crecord contains no evidence of \nApplicant engaging in online gaming since June 2022.\u201d Decision at 6. As the Government \nhighlights, Applicant herself testified that she was active on Chumba Casino until September 2022, \nthe month in which she received the additional allegation regarding gambling. Tr. at 166. More \nimportantly, there is substantial record evidence that Applicant continued to play for cash on \nChumba Casino until at least May 2023, in direct contradiction of her testimony, and the Judge \nfailed to acknowledge or address this critical evidence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAs background \u2013 the record has Applicant\u2019s bank statements for four random months \nbetween February 2021 and June 2022. Although the record is silent as to why those particular \nbank statements were submitted post-SOR, it is these documents that caused the Government to \namend the SOR and allege gambling (SOR \u00b6 1.i). The statements reflect that Applicant purchased \n\u201cChumba Gold Coins\u201d on approximately 125 occasions during those four months, typically in the \namount of $100 per purchase. Those same records show approximately 17 deposits from \u201cStichting \nCustodian Worldpay\u201d (Worldpay), which typically occurred a day or two after the purchase of \nChumba Gold Coins. GE 6; AE J. In addition to the four monthly statements, Applicant submitted \nat hearing her bank statements for the period of December 2022 through June 2023. Those monthly \nstatements reflect no purchases of Chumba Gold Coins, but they reflect 26 additional deposits \nfrom Worldpay ending in May 2023, just two months prior to the hearing. AE J. \nUnder cross-examination at hearing, Applicant admitted that she received her cash prizes \nfrom Chumba Casino through Worldpay. Tr. at 144 (\u201c[Government]: And the payouts, when you \nwould receive payouts from Chumba, you would get those from, was it [Worldpay]? . . . Is that \nwho you would receive payments from? [Applicant]: That sounds right.\u201d). Shortly thereafter, the \nJudge sua sponte raised a question about the relationship between Chumba Casino and Worldpay \nand stated that she \u201cneed[ed] the government to support the assertion that those two companies are \nrelated.\u201d Id. at 147. After the Judge raised the issue, Applicant equivocated about whether all \ndeposits from Worldpay represented winnings from Chumba Casino, but she failed to articulate \nany other plausible explanation for the payments. As cross-examination continued, Applicant \nasserted that she stopped playing Chumba Casino in September 2022. When the Government \nattempted to question Applicant about continued gaming, as reflected in continued deposits from \nWorldpay through the spring of 2023, the Judge curtailed cross-examination, citing to a lack of \nfoundation for the relationship between Chumba Casino and Worldpay. Id. at 167-168. \nPost-hearing and at the Judge\u2019s suggestion, the Government submitted documents that \nconfirmed that Worldpay is the payor for Chumba Casino. GE 13. That substantial evidence was \nbuttressed by other significant evidence of record, to include: Applicant\u2019s initial admission at \nhearing that she received her cash prizes from Worldpay, the timing of the purchases from Chumba \nCasino and the pay-outs from Worldpay, and Applicant\u2019s failure, either at hearing or in post-\nhearing submissions, to establish any other explanation for the payments from Worldpay. In the \naggregate, this evidence raised an obvious question of whether Applicant lied at the hearing when \nshe testified that she stopped playing the online game in September 2022. \nIn her decision, the Judge failed to acknowledge, much less resolve, the question that she \nherself raised at hearing \u2013 whether the deposits from Worldpay on Applicant\u2019s bank statements \nrepresented Applicant\u2019s winnings from Chumba Casino. Instead, the Judge simply omitted any \ndiscussion of the issue and found, in the face of substantial evidence to the contrary, that Applicant \nceased gaming on Chumba Casino in June 2022. The Judge erred in making this finding without \nrecognizing and analyzing the conflicting evidence. While administrative judges enjoy broad \ndiscretion in weighing evidence, that discretion is not unlimited. When conflicts exist within the \nrecord, a judge must weigh the evidence and resolve those conflicts based upon a careful evaluation \nof factors such as the evidence\u2019s \u201ccomparative reliability, plausibility and ultimate truthfulness.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 05-06723 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2007).

We conclude that the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant \nstopped gaming on Chumba Casino in June 2022 is not supported by such evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate in light of all the contrary evidence. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nThe next challenged finding \u2013 that \u201cApplicant earned sufficient income to support her \nchosen recreational activity\u201d of gaming \u2013 goes to the very heart of this case. It is an inexplicable \nand clearly erroneous finding. We pause here to highlight that the record does not contain \ncontinuous or complete bank statements, but instead somewhat random monthly statements. For \nthe 18-month period between February 2021 and June 2022, the record holds just four monthly \nbank statements. Even those limited records establish that Applicant was not earning sufficient \nincome to support her gaming habit given the fact that Applicant was carrying approximately \n$71,600 in alleged delinquent debt. Notably, the bank statements in the record begin the month \nafter Applicant\u2019s January 2021 interview with a background investigator, who put her on notice \nthat her delinquent debt was of security concern. Her bank statement for mid-February through \nmid-March 2021 reflects that Applicant spent $9,300 on Chumba Casino over approximately 80 \ntransactions and was overdrawn at the end of the statement period. Over the next month, Applicant \npaid approximately $3,800 to Chumba Casino in over 30 transactions and traveled to another state \nto gamble in a brick-and-mortar casino. That month, despite receiving over $32,700 in various \ndeposits, Applicant failed to pay down any of the alleged delinquencies and had only about $680 \nremaining at the end of the statement period. Against the backdrop of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts, \nthe Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant earned sufficient income to support her gaming activity is \nwholly unsupported by the record. \nIn sum, the Judge\u2019s findings of fact do not reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record \nevidence. Regardless of whether Applicant\u2019s activities on Chumba Casino constituted gambling \nor gaming, the evidence indicates that Applicant was spending beyond her means on online games \nwhile failing to pay significant delinquent debt; that she did not earn sufficient income to support \nher chosen recreational activity; and that she continued to play the online sweepstakes casino game \nfor a full year after the Judge found her to have ceased and was, in fact, still playing in May 2023 \nas her hearing approached. Moreover, because these erroneous factual findings underpin the \nJudge\u2019s mitigation analysis, the favorable formal findings are unsustainable, as discussed below. \nCredibility Determination \nAt hearing, Applicant steadfastly insisted that her gaming did not interfere with paying her \ndebt, that \u201cone had nothing to do with the other,\u201d and that she stopped playing the online game in \nSeptember 2022. Tr. at 74, 166. In her findings of fact, the Judge appears to have adopted \nApplicant\u2019s testimony on these material issues, without acknowledging and reconciling \ncontradictory evidence, and the Government challenges that implicit favorable credibility \ndetermination. We give deference to a judge\u2019s credibility determinations, but that deference is not \nunfettered. As we have previously held, when the record \u201ccontains a basis to question an \napplicant\u2019s credibility,\u201d the judge \u201cshould address that aspect of the record explicitly.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 07-10158 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2008). Failure to do so suggests that a judge \u201chas merely \nsubstituted a favorable impression of an applicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence.\u201d Id.

When confronted \nwith the scope of her purchases of Chumba Gold Coins during cross-examination, Applicant \nsimply denied what the bank statements showed. As noted above, Applicant insisted that her \ngaming did not interfere with paying her debt and that \u201cone had nothing to do with the other,\u201d \nalthough she was, in some months, clearly spending all discretionary funds on gaming rather than \npaying delinquent debts. Tr. at 74. Additionally, Applicant was evasive in answering questions \nabout when she started playing the online game. On direct examination, Applicant stated \nunequivocally that she started playing Chumba Casino in February 2021, apparently to align with \nthe first month for which there were bank records in evidence. Later, under cross-examination, \nApplicant equivocated: \u201cI said I played in February. I didn\u2019t say started. I didn\u2019t say ended.\u201d Id. at \n75, 144. Ultimately, as the Government highlights, Applicant\u2019s own tax records, submitted post-\nhearing, show gambling income and loss entries dating back to 2016, a fact that the Judge failed \nto acknowledge or address. \nSecond, Applicant misrepresented that various alleged debts were paid off or that she was \ncurrent on a payment plan at every juncture of the security clearance process: to the background \ninvestigator, on her Answer to the SOR, and at hearing. To choose just one example \u2013 the debt \nrepresented in SOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 Applicant told the investigator in January 2021 that the debt had been \nsatisfied in November 2020; on her Answer to the SOR in May 2022, Applicant wrote, \u201cDeny its \npaid off no debt owed\u201d and \u201cPaid in Full\u201d; and, at hearing, Applicant testified that she was certain \nshe had settled and paid the account, but that the company could not provide documentation as it \nhad no record of her. GE 9; Answer; Tr. at 133. In fact, Applicant ultimately settled and paid the \ndebt in September 2023 \u2013 after her hearing. AE EE. Putting aside Applicant\u2019s statements to the \nbackground investigator and focusing solely on Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, it appears that, \nfor a majority of the eight alleged delinquencies, Applicant\u2019s response was misleading and \ninaccurate in that she represented debts as paid when they were not, or herself as compliant with a \npayment plan when she was not. As the Government argues, \u201cAt no point did the Judge \nacknowledge these inconsistencies, further undercutting her credibility determination.\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 12. \nThird, as addressed above, the Judge completely ignored Applicant\u2019s more recent bank \nstatements, which reflect 26 deposits from Chumba Casino\u2019s payor during the period of December \n2022 through May 2023 but no purchases from Chumba Casino. Said differently, the monthly \nstatements reflect pay-outs but no buy-ins. The Government argues that the evidence suggests that \nApplicant, after receiving the amended SOR in September 2022, changed the manner in which she \npurchased Chumba Gold Coins in order to shield her continuing gaming from the Government and \nthat the \u201cJudge\u2019s failure to consider these significant facts makes her credibility determination \nunsustainable.\u201d Id. We agree. We are persuaded that the Judge merely substituted a favorable \nimpression of Applicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence and allowed this favorable impression to \ndistort her findings of fact and her analysis.  \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \nMitigation Analysis \nWith respect to the eight delinquent debt SOR allegations, the Judge found that Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of financial problems established disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(e). \nShe concluded, however, that the concerns were mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d),3 \nspecifically finding: that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by family events beyond her \ncontrol; that she \u201cacted responsibly to resolve the debts\u201d; that \u201cthe circumstances under which \nApplicant incurred the debt do not reflect negatively on her current security worthiness\u201d; and that \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s financial problems do not raise any behavior that indicates poor self-control.\u201d \nDecision at 8. \nThe Government challenges this mitigation analysis, noting that it is based largely on the \nJudge\u2019s erroneous findings of fact. Even assuming that Applicant\u2019s financial issues initially \nresulted from circumstances beyond her control, the Government argues her excessive spending \nand gaming in lieu of paying her delinquent debts preclude application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b). \nThe Government highlights that, since 2019, Applicant has made anywhere from $130,000 to \n$220,000 per year; that she has made more than $190,000 per year since 2021 with a significant \nmonthly surplus; and that she received $140,000 in 2021 following the sale of her parents\u2019 home. \nDespite these significant resources, Applicant did not act on five of the eight alleged debts, which \ntotaled over $52,000, until after receiving the SOR and instead gave herself a monthly \nentertainment budget of at least $2,500 that she often surpassed. \nWe concur that the Judge\u2019s application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) is not sustainable. As we \nnoted earlier, regardless of whether Applicant\u2019s activities on Chumba Casino constituted gambling \nwithin the meaning of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(h) and 19(i), they certainly were \u201cconsistent spending beyond \none\u2019s means or frivolous or irresponsible spending\u201d within the meaning of AG \u00b6 19(e), as \nApplicant failed to take any significant action on alleged debts while spending thousands of dollars \na month on gaming. Contrary to the Judge\u2019s conclusion, that behavior was not responsible under \nthe circumstances. Moreover, the evidence that Applicant continued to play on Chumba Casino \nthrough at least May 2023, after being put on notice of the security concerns, casts doubt on her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment, as does her adamant refusal to even \nacknowledge that her gaming was adversely affecting her financial life. ISCR Case No. 22-02113 \nat 7 (App Bd. Jan. 31, 2024). The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s behavior was mitigated \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) reflects a clear error of judgment, rendering it arbitrary and \ncapricious. \nFinally, the Government argues that the post-SOR timing of Applicant\u2019s debt resolution \nefforts undercuts application of AG \u00b6 20(d), which requires a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors. As the Government highlights, the Appeal Board has long held that the timing of an \napplicant\u2019s efforts to resolve debts is relevant in evaluating the sufficiency of their case for \n3 AG \u00b6\u00b6 20: (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was infrequent of occurred under such circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; (b) \nthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances; (d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. Although the Judge did not cite explicitly to AG \u00b6 20(b), her analysis \nmakes it clear that she found it applicable. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigation, as applicants who begin to resolve their debts only after an SOR has placed them on \nnotice that their clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment to follow rules and regulations \nwhen there is no immediate threat to their own interest. E.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03122 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Aug 17, 2018). Despite the resources to address her delinquencies, Applicant failed to address \nthe majority of the eight debts until after she received the SOR. Of the three debts apparently \nresolved prior to the SOR, at least one was resolved involuntarily, after Applicant received a \nwarrant in debt. As the Government highlights, the Judge failed to acknowledge or address the fact \nthat Applicant only took efforts to resolve most of her debts after she received the SOR. We concur \nthat the Judge\u2019s failure to consider this important aspect of the case renders her application of AG \n\u00b6 20(d) arbitrary and capricious. \nConclusion \nWhen the Board finds that a judge\u2019s decision is unsustainable, we must determine if the \nappropriate remedy is remand or reversal. The former is appropriate when the legal errors can be \ncorrected through remand and there is a significant chance of reaching a different result upon \ncorrection, such as when a judge fails to consider relevant and material evidence. If the identified \nerrors cannot be remedied on remand, the decision must be reversed. Such is the case when, after \naddressing the identified error, the Board concludes that a contrary formal finding or overall grant \nor denial of security clearance eligibility is the clear outcome based on the record. ISCR Case No. \n22-01002 (App. Bd.

On \nMarch 10, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, \n2017) (SEAD 4) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).

The Government appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged 11 financial concerns which reflect a mix of medical and consumer debt \ntotaling approximately $51,000.

Rather, he contends that the Judge failed to adhere to Executive Order \n10865 and the Directive by not adequately considering all of the record evidence and by not \nproperly applying the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept. Essentially, the \nGovernment argues that the Judge erred because even if Applicant\u2019s financial problems were \ncaused by conditions beyond her control, she had not acted reasonably and responsibly in \naddressing them. However, our review of the Judge\u2019s decision confirms that he considered all \nrelevant issues and properly applied the mitigating conditions. Consistent with the following, we \naffirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in her late 40s, twice divorced, and is the mother of two adult children and a \nminor adopted child. She was on active duty in the Navy from 2004 \u2013 2016 and was honorably \ndischarged. She was financially stable until 2012 when she entered into legal proceedings to gain \ncustody of her two then-minor children. Applicant financed this process with a $10,000 loan which \nshe timely repaid. However, the additional expenses of gaining custody of her children, coupled \nwith payments on the loan, created financial stress. At about that same time, her teenage son \nbecame a father and Applicant contributed to help support that child. Collectively these events led \nto the delinquent consumer debt alleged in the SOR. Facing financial pressures, in 2016 Applicant \ntook cash advances using her government-issued credit card, even though she was aware that \npersonal use of the credit card was not permitted. She paid the credit card bills when due, and the \nNavy incurred no costs. Applicant was counseled for having misused the credit card, and she has \nexpressed remorse for this conduct. \nUpon leaving the Navy in April 2016, Applicant moved to another state and was \nunemployed until January 2018, at which time she obtained her current job as an aircraft mechanic. \nShe initially earned approximately $72,000 a year and was maintaining payments on some of her \ndebts. However, she accumulated medical co-pay debt as a result of five surgeries. During the \nrecuperation period from each surgery, her income was reduced by approximately 40%. Even \nthrough her salary increased over time to approximately $93,000, Applicant was unable to keep \nup with payments. Also during this period, Applicant incurred approximately $20,000 in legal and \nattorney fees as a result of her efforts to adopt her son\u2019s daughter. She paid these expenses, but \nthese efforts diverted funds from her ability to pay other debts. Subsequent to issuance of the SOR, \nApplicant re-engaged with some of her creditors and created payment plans. However, her most \nrecent surgery again limited her income and impacted her ability to make payments. \nThe Judge concluded that these circumstances were beyond Applicant\u2019s control, that \nshe acted responsibly under the circumstances and has a plan to address her delinquencies. \nDiscussion \nThe crux of the Government\u2019s appellate argument is that it was error for the Judge to have \nconcluded that Applicant made a good-faith effort to address her debts in light of the fact that she \ncontacted creditors only after receiving the SOR, resolved only two small debts, and has been \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunable to make payments on any others. The Government argues that this amounts to a \u201cde \nminimis\u201d effort and not \u201csubstantial steps to repay,\u201d as the Judge had concluded. \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998). \nA security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s \ndebts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). The scope of \nGuideline F encompasses not only an Applicant\u2019s current financial situation, but also extends to \nhis or her financial history. As a general rule, an applicant is not required to be debt-free nor to \ndevelop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or simultaneously. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n09-08462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 31, 2011). However, an applicant must act responsibly given his or \nher circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by concomitant \nconduct even if it may only provide for the payment of debts one at a time. ISCR Case No. 07\u00ad\n06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). What constitutes responsible behavior depends on the facts \nof a given case and the fact that an applicant's debts will not be paid off for a long time, in and of \nitself, may be of limited security concern. ISCR Case No. 09-08462 at 4. Relevant to the equation \nis an assessment as to whether an applicant acted responsibly given her limited resources See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct 29, 2009). \nIn essence, the Government is advocating for an alternative weighing of the evidence. \nHowever, disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability to argue for a \ndifferent interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to conclude that the Judge weighed the \nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 2007). Whether or not Applicant\u2019s efforts \nwere \u201csubstantial steps to repay her debts\u201d as the Judge concluded is a subjective determination \nand well within the Judge\u2019s discretion to decide. The Judge considered that Applicant's poor \nfinancial condition originated from unemployment, legal bills attendant to custody and adoption \nproceedings, and medical bills, all of which were outside her control. None of this reflects \nirresponsible or frivolous spending. The Judge thoroughly addressed Applicant\u2019s circumstances as \nthey impacted her limited efforts to resolve her debts and reasonably concluded that she has not \nbeen financially irresponsible considering that \u201cat times her ability to [address her debts] was \ninterrupted by medical expenses and reduced income due to disability.\u201d Decision at 6. \nWe have considered the entirety of the arguments contained in Government\u2019s appeal brief. \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. \nIns. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988), regarding security clearances: such a determination \u201cmay be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u201d\u2019 See, e.g., ADP Case No. 19-01882 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2020). See also Kaplan v. Conyers, 733 F.3d 1148 (Fed. Cir. 2013), cert. \ndenied. None of the Government\u2019s arguments are sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the evidence in the record, nor are they enough to show that the Judge weighed \nthe evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nChristopher Snowden, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nApril 21, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct), F (Financial \nConsiderations), and J (Criminal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \nin Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive \n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On December 5, \n2023, after the record closed, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant \nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe SOR contains one allegation under Guideline J, which is cross-alleged under Guideline \nE, and six allegations under Guideline F.

These favorable findings were not raised as an issue on appeal and are not discussed \nbelow. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, who is in his mid-thirties, served on active duty in the military from 2008 to \n2012, and in the reserve force until 2021. He was administratively separated with a General under \nHonorable Conditions discharge in 2021 after being convicted by a state court of depositing into \nhis bank account a $5,000 check that was not made out to him. Originally charged with larceny of \nchecks, forgery, uttering, obtaining money under false pretenses, and identity theft, he pled guilty \nto larceny and identity theft and the other charges were dropped. He was sentenced to a total of \nfive years in prison, all of which was suspended, and one year of probation. He successfully \ncompleted his probation and his suspended sentence ends in February 2025. Applicant disclosed \nhis convictions in his security clearance application, has no other criminal record, has accepted \nresponsibility for his conduct, and credibly expressed remorse. The Judge concluded that, although \nApplicant has taken positive steps, insufficient time has passed to mitigate the criminal conduct. \nDiscussion \nApplicant argues that the Judge erred in failing to comply with the provisions in Executive \nOrder 10865 and the Directive by not considering all of the evidence, by not properly weighing \nthe evidence, and by not correctly applying the mitigating conditions and Whole-Person Concept. \nIn his arguments, he contends that the alleged misconduct is not recent or frequent, that it occurred \nunder unusual circumstances that are unlikely to recur, and that he has rehabilitated himself in the \nintervening years. These arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the \nevidence, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached \nconclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See ISCR Case No. 06\u00ad\n17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nThe Board has repeatedly declined to furnish \u201cbright line\u201d guidance regarding the concept \nof recency. The extent to which security concerns have become mitigated through the passage of \ntime is a question that must be resolved based on the evidence as a whole. See ISCR Case No. 17\u00ad\n04070 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 18, 2019). Our review of the record and decision establishes that the \nJudge carefully considered all evidence in mitigation, including the passage of time since the \nFebruary 2020 conviction, but determined it was insufficient given that Applicant remains under \na suspended sentence. The suspended sentence can be revoked if Applicant commits further \nmisconduct, and he is therefore subject to oversight and a level of control during the period of \nsuspension. See Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 19.2-306 (2016). In evaluating an applicant\u2019s claim of \nrehabilitation, the judge may consider that an applicant\u2019s behavior during the suspended sentence \nperiod is largely dependent upon the controlling influences inherent therein. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 05-07983 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 1, 2007). \nIn rendering a decision, the Judge was required to consider all the record evidence. \nDirective \u00b6 6.3. Given the nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s fraudulent conduct, we cannot \nconclude that the Judge erred in determining that the security concerns arising from such \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmisconduct were not mitigated by the passage of time or by the other evidence of rehabilitation. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all \nof the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, \n2020). Moreover, the Judge complied with the requirements of the Directive in her whole-person \nanalysis by considering all evidence of record in reaching her decision. \nApplicant failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. In light of the \nrecord before her, the Judge\u2019s determination that insufficient time has passed to conclude that \nApplicant is unlikely to engage in further misconduct was not arbitrary or capricious given his \nrelatively recent conviction and ongoing probation. The decision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe \ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests \nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

On \nApril 14, 2022, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse), \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On \nNovember 1, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Eric C. Price \ndenied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana from about November \n2017 to about October 2020, that he purchased marijuana in about November 2019, and that he \nused and purchased from about November 2017 to about October 2020 while granted access to \nclassified information. Under Guideline E, Applicant\u2019s use and purchase of marijuana while \ngranted access was cross-alleged.

The Judge noted, however, that Applicant used marijuana for several years while \nholding a security clearance and with access to classified information and \u201cwith knowledge that \nits use was prohibited under federal law and DoD policy.\u201d Decision at 7. These circumstances, the \nJudge concluded, \u201creflect poor judgment and raise questions as to his trustworthiness.\u201d Id. at 8. \nMoreover, the Judge was not convinced that recurrence was unlikely because Applicant used \nmarijuana more than 40 times over a four-year period, provided varying accounts of the number \nof times he used and purchased marijuana, and continues to associate with people who use \nmarijuana. \nOn appeal, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact but alleges that \nthe Judge \u201cmade several unfounded assumptions,\u201d particularly regarding the risk of recurrence. \nAppeal Brief at 1.

Mendez, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nNicholas T. Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro Se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nApril 26, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) and Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) (SEAD 4) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). On December 1, 2023, after conducting a hearing, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Candace Le\u2019i Garcia granted Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility. The Government, through Department Counsel, appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the decision. \nUnder Guideline D, the SOR alleges that Applicant was accused of sexual harassment in \nMay 2019, resulting in substantiated allegations and being indefinitely barred from access to \ncertain overseas military locations. SOR \u00b6 1.a. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant \nwas terminated from contractor employment in September 2019 for sexual harassment and is \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nineligible for rehire. SOR \u00b6 2.a. Additionally, the SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his February \n2020 security clearance application (SCA) for not accurately reporting the reason for his 2020 \ntermination from contract employment. SOR \u00b6 2.b. In finding favorably for Applicant, the Judge \nconcluded that the Government had failed to establish the falsification of the SOR (SOR \u00b6 2.b.) \nand that Applicant had mitigated the security concerns established under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a. (the \nsexual harassment conduct and the termination for the same). \nOn appeal, the Government contends that the Judge erred in her conclusion that \nfalsification was not established and erred in her mitigation analysis under Guidelines D and E, \nrendering her decisions arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. Consistent with the following, \nwe affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s findings are summarized below. \nApplicant is in his mid-30s. Divorced from his first wife, he remarried in 2019. He has one \nchild. He is a high school graduate and received a vocational school degree in 2008. He served in \nthe National Guard from 2011 to 2017 but was separated with a general discharge under honorable \nconditions because he missed drills while deployed overseas as a civilian contractor. He was \nemployed as a defense contractor at a U.S. military installation overseas from January 2016 to \nSeptember 2019, when he was terminated for cause. He was reemployed in October 2022 with a \ndefense contractor who is sponsoring him for renewal of his security clearance. Decision at 2. \nIn May 2019, while assigned overseas, Applicant was accused of sexual harassment by a \nfemale soldier with whom he worked. The woman alleged three incidents. First, she alleged that \nhe saw her at the post exchange, walked up to her, ran his fingers through her hair, and asked if he \ncould remover her hair bun. Second, she accused him of asking her what she had purchased from \na women\u2019s lingerie, clothing, and beauty store. Finally, she alleged he walked up behind her while \nat work, touched her shoulder, and started to give her a massage. Id. \nOn August 21, 2019, Applicant was placed on paid administrative leave, which he did not \nview as a suspension. While on administrative leave, he was \u201cbrought into the captain\u2019s office due \nto an investigation regarding the soldier\u2019s claims,\u201d and he provided a written statement in response \nto the allegations. On September 21, 2019, he was placed on unpaid administrative leave prior to \ntermination on September 23, 2019. He is not eligible for rehire. Id. at 3. In October 2019, he \nreceived a letter from the installation commanding officer indefinitely barring him from access to \nthe job site and certain military installations because of substantiated sexual harassment \nallegations. \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant said, \u201cI was unaware of being terminated/fired and \nnot eligible for rehire as I was only told that I was released from contract. So therefore[,] I deny \nknowing that I was terminated/fired prior to my video interview.\u201d He reiterated these sentiments \nduring his July 2020 personal subject interview (PSI) and at the hearing. Applicant admitted that \nsexual harassment allegations were made against him and that, as a result, he was barred from the \naccess to certain military installations. Although he generally denied the allegations, Applicant \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nacknowledged that, in the third instance, he walked up behind the soldier at work and touched her \nshoulder. He was never formally given any evidence regarding the allegations, it was the only time \nhe had been in trouble, and similar conduct has not happened since. Id. at 2-3. \nApplicant stated that no one informed him that he was suspended and that he was only \nasked to turn his DOD Common Access Card into his site lead. He was not required to formally \nout-process and return to the United States, and he was not barred from all installations around \nother command locations. He remained in-country until early 2020, when he returned to the United \nStates to seek employment. Id. at 3. \nWhen Applicant completed his 2020 SCA, he listed his employment with the contractor \nfrom January 2016 to September 2019 in Section 13A - Employment Activities. In response to the \nquestion that asked why he left the employment, he stated that he had been \u201creleased from \ncontract.\u201d Applicant checked \u201cNo\u201d in response to the question whether he left under any of the \nfollowing circumstances: fired; quit after being told he would be fired; left by mutual agreement \nfollowing charges or allegations of misconduct; or, left by mutual agreement following notice of \nunsatisfactory performance for his listed employer. Applicant also checked \u201cNo\u201d in response to \nthe question whether, in the prior seven years in this employment, he had \u201creceived a written \nwarning, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, \nsuch as a violation of security policy?\u201d \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated \u201cI admit to choosing No on this question due \nto not knowing that I was fired from [this employment]. I was only told I was released from \ncontract. This was an honest mistake and was not intentional.\u201d Applicant also maintained during \nhis July 2020 PSI and at the hearing that he did not view his placement on administrative leave as \na suspension. Applicant had no previous unfavorable incidents, and he has not had any since. He \nwas not arrested or charged with any offense. He expressed remorse for his actions and stated that \nhe learned his lesson. His spouse is aware of the allegations. Id. at 4. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is summarized below. \nUnder Guideline D, the Judge found that disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 13(d)1 applied to \nthe substantiated sexual harassment allegations, but that the security concern was mitigated under \nAG \u00b6 14(b)2, as the incident was isolated and occurred over four years ago, Applicant was not \narrested or charged with any offense, and he was remorseful and had learned his lesson. Id. at 6. \n1 Sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or judgment. AG \u00b6 13(d). \n2 The sexual behavior happed so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. AG \u00b6 14(b). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the Judge found that disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(e)(1)3 was \nestablished for SOR \u00b6 2.a, based on the substantiated allegations of sexual harassment and his \nineligibility for rehire, but concluded that mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c)4 and 17(e)5 applied. \nSimilar to her findings under Guideline D, the Judge held that Applicant\u2019s termination in 2019 due \nto substantiated allegations of sexual harassment was an isolated incident that occurred over four \nyears ago. In addition, Applicant had no previous unfavorable incidents, nor any incidents since, \nincluding with his current employer. He was not arrested or charged with any offense, he expressed \nremorse for his actions and stated that he learned his lesson, and his spouse is aware of the \nallegations. \nThe Judge found that disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(a)6 was not established for SOR \u00b6 \n2.b (falsification of his SCA) because Applicant \u201ccredibly testified\u201d that he did not deliberately \nfalsify his responses to the questions that inquired about his \u201cReasons for Leaving\u201d employment \nwith the overseas contractor. She highlighted that Applicant disclosed his employment with the \ncontractor from January 2016 to September 2019 and that he disclosed that he had been released \nfrom the contract by his employer in September 2019. She found Applicant to be credible in his \nassertion that he did not believe that he had been fired or disciplined. Id. at 6\u20137. \nDiscussion \nThere is no presumption of error. The appealing party has the burden of raising and \nestablishing that the Judge committed factual or legal error that is prejudicial. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo.19-01689 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2020). In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions \nare erroneous, we will review the decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant \nevidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational \nconnection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it \nreflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an \nexplanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it \n3 Personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. AG \n\u00b6 16 (e)(1). \n4 The offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such \nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c). \n5 The individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6 17(e). \n6 Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n\u00b6 16 (a). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.

Jul. 14, 1998). \nApplication of Mitigating Conditions \nOn appeal, the Government first argues that the Judge\u2019s application of mitigating \nconditions to Applicant\u2019s sexual harassment conduct under Guidelines D and E was unsupported \nby the evidence. In particular, the Government challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant \n\u201cexpressed remorse for his actions and stated that he learned his lesson.\u201d Decision at 7. The \nGovernment argues that \u201cApplicant does not use the words \u2018regret\u2019 or \u2018remorse\u2019 anywhere in this \nrecord\u201d and that the Judge erred as a matter of law in finding Applicant remorseful and his \nmisconduct unlikely to recur. Appeal Brief (AB) at 16\u201317. Using specific language is not, \nhowever, required to express remorse or regret. Here, Applicant admitted to touching the \ncomplainant and having conversations that she considered offensive, but he denied that they \namounted to or were intended as sexual harassment. Applicant testified that he learned a lesson, \nincluding \u201c[d]on\u2019t touch anybody, whether it\u2019s just a friendly touch, or anything else, because \nanything can be construed more than what you believe it is. Whether it\u2019s verbal, touching or \nanything of the sort.\u201d Tr. at 47. The Judge found that Applicant expressed his intent to change the \nbehavior that the complainant found to be offensive, to include, not \u201ctouching\u201d anyone (physically \nor verbally), even if the touching is intended to be friendly or playful. This is a positive step \ndemonstrating a change in attitude and behavior and relevant mitigating evidence. We find the \nJudge\u2019s credibility determination in this regard to be adequately based on \u201cobjective testimonial \nevidence.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07983 at 7 (App. Bd. Oct. 1, 2007). \nTo the extent that Department Counsel is asserting that the Judge improperly substituted a \nfavorable credibility determination for record evidence in concluding that the mitigating conditions \napplied, we disagree. The Judge had the opportunity to assess Applicant's demeanor when he \ntestified at the hearing, and the opportunity to consider whether Applicant's explanations were \ncredible in light of the record evidence as a whole. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-19479 at 3\u20134 (App. \nBd. June 22, 2004). We have held that a judge cannot rely on a credibility determination as a \nsubstitute for record evidence and that a judge\u2019s assessment of the evidence should not suggest \nthat the judge is using her authority to render an improper credibility determination. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 10-07794 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 4, 2011). Here, as in the cited case, the Judge's decision \nindicates that\u2014in addition to any reliance on credibility alone\u2014she relied on objective evidence \nin applying the mitigating conditions in question. Id. Although Department Counsel may disagree \nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, we find no reason to conclude that the Judge erred in \nher mitigation analysis under Guidelines D and E. \nIntentional Omissions \nIn their second argument, Department Counsel challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the \nGovernment failed to prove that Applicant deliberately falsified his 2020 SCA. Here again, the \nGovernment challenges the Judge\u2019s credibility determination, arguing that the Judge\u2019s conclusion \nthat Applicant \u201ccredibly testified\u201d that he committed no deliberate falsification \u201cwas erroneous \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand . . . must be reversed.\u201d AB at 19. Although the Government acknowledges the deference \ntypically given to a judge on questions of credibility, Department Counsel argues that this is a case \nin which no deference is due because Applicant\u2019s testimony is \u201cso internally inconsistent or \nimplausible\u201d that a reasonable factfinder could not accept it. AB at 20 (citations omitted). \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied that he intentionally falsified his SCA by not \ndisclosing that he had been fired or disciplined. Therefore, the burden of proving falsification \nshifted to the Government. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not \nestablish or prove Applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when he completed the SCA. See ISCR Case \nNo. 02-23133, 2004 WL 2152744 at *4 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004). See also ISCR Case No. 14\u00ad\n05005, 2017 WL 4476434 at *4, n.3 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, 2017) (to establish a falsification, an \napplicant\u2019s answers must have been deliberately false, not simply untrue). Rather, the Judge had \nto consider whether, viewing the record evidence as a whole, there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning Applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when he completed the SCA. \nThe Board\u2019s deference to an Administrative Judge's credibility determination is, of course, \nnot absolute. For instance, a credibility determination may be set aside or reversed if it is \nunreasonable, contradicts other findings, is based on an inadequate reason, is patently without basis \nin the record, or is inherently improbable or discredited by undisputed fact. See ISCR Case No. \n97-0184 at 5 (App. Bd. June 16, 1998) (internal citations omitted). \u201cWhen a witness\u2019s story is \ncontradicted by other evidence or is so internally inconsistent or implausible that a reasonable fact \nfinder would not credit it, we can find error despite the deference owed a Judge\u2019s credibility \ndetermination.\u201d ISCR Case No. 10-03886 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr 26, 2012), citing Anderson v. \nBessemer City, 470 U.S. 564 at 575 (1985). A Judge\u2019s credibility determination can be rejected if \nit is \u201cunreasonable, contradicts other findings of fact, or is \u2018based on an inadequate reason or no \nreason at all.\u2019\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-03763 (App. Bd. Nov. 20. 2018), citing Fieldcrest Cannon, Inc. \nv. NLRB., 97 F.3d. 65 at 69 - 70 (4th Cir. 1996). \nNotably, the Government\u2019s case regarding intent was purely circumstantial. The \nGovernment\u2019s exhibits confirm that Applicant was placed on paid administrative leave on August \n21, 2019, that he was placed on unpaid administrative leave on September 21, 2019, and that two \ndays later\u2014on September 23, 2019\u2014Applicant was terminated for cause. Government Exhibit \n(GE) 3 at 7\u201310. What the Government\u2019s exhibits lack is proof that any of those facts were \ncommunicated to Applicant. The Government did not submit the Army\u2019s investigation of the \nsexual harassment complaint or any other evidence that reflects what Applicant was told regarding \nhis paid and unpaid administrative leave periods or his termination. That lack of Government \nevidence left an ambiguous void that was filled by Applicant\u2019s testimony. Under cross-\nexamination and the Judge\u2019s examination at hearing, Applicant testified that this employment was \nhis first job as a contractor, that he was told by text message that he was released from the contract, \nthat he was never advised by his employer that he was terminated or fired, and that he only later \nreceived a letter from a local commander barring him from certain installations. Consistent with \nhis Answer to the SOR, Applicant testified at hearing that he understood he was released from his \ncontract but did not understand that he was fired. The Government presented neither documentary \nnor testimonial evidence contradicting Applicant\u2019s consistent assertion that, as a first-time \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontractor, he did not recognize that his release from contract was equivalent to being fired and \nthus required to be reported as the same in Section 13A of his SCA. \nIn addition to arguing that Applicant should have recognized that he was fired and \ndisclosed the same, the Government repeatedly argues that Applicant should have recognized his \nperiod of administrative leave to be a \u201csuspension\u201d requiring disclosure under Section 13A.6, \nwhich reads: \u201cFor this employment in the last seven (7) years have you received a written warning, \nbeen officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace such as a \nviolation of security policy?\u201d Department Counsel argues that a person placed on administrative \nleave due to the allegations of sexual harassment in the workplace has \u201cobviously been \n\u2018suspended.\u2019\u201d AB at 22. The Government cites to no authority for the assumption that underlies \nmuch of their brief\u2014that being placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation is per \nse a disciplinary action equivalent to a suspension\u2014and we are aware of none. Whether or not \nadministrative leave \u2013 paid or unpaid \u2013 is a disciplinary action is a question of fact that is dependent \nupon the circumstances. In this case, although the administrative leave was tied to the sexual \nharassment complaint, the Government did not present evidence explaining whether this was \nconsidered a disciplinary action and, if so, why. Even when administrative leave is associated with \nan investigation, it cannot be assumed that it is a disciplinary action, particularly when the \nadministrative leave is paid. At risk of stating the obvious, had the investigation cleared Applicant, \nthat period of time would clearly not fall within Section 13A.6\u2019s definition of a disciplinary action \nor warning. Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the plain meaning of \u201cadministrative leave\u201d in \nthis context logically leads any \u201creasonable person\u201d to conclude they are \u201csuspended\u201d is without \nmerit. Id. \nIn this case, Applicant steadfastly maintained that he did not understand himself to be under \na suspension when he was on paid administrative leave. Regarding his period of unpaid \nadministrative leave, Applicant testified that he was in that status for \u201conly like a day,\u201d and \nDepartment Counsel did not inquire into or establish when Applicant was advised of that status\u2014 \nwhether it was on September 21st when he went into an unpaid status, on September 23rd when he \nwas terminated, or at some later date when he received his final pay. Tr. at 39. To the extent that \nApplicant was on unpaid leave for either one or two days prior to being advised that he was \nreleased from the contract, the record does not support the Government\u2019s argument that Applicant \nknew of this fleeting status at the time, recognized it to be a disciplinary measure, and intentionally \nfailed to disclose the same. \nBecause Applicant\u2019s version of what he was told is consistent and uncontroverted, there \nwas no direct factual conflict for the Judge to resolve. Cf. ISCR Case No. 10-03886 (App. Bd. Apr. \n26, 2012) (in which the Judge chose to believe Applicant\u2019s testimony regarding alleged timecard \nfraud rather than the employer\u2019s findings) and ISCR Case No. 19-02304 (App. Bd. Feb. 23, 2022) \n(in which the Judge accepted Applicant\u2019s in-hearing denials regarding receipt of child pornography \nand disregarded Applicant\u2019s prior admissions). Thus, the remaining issue was the reasonableness \nof Applicant\u2019s professed belief that, under the circumstances, he had not been fired or suspended. \nWhile the Government asserts that it is \u201cobvious\u201d from the overall circumstances that Applicant \nwas fired, that is not the only conclusion that can be reached under these facts. Having had the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nopportunity to observe and assess Applicant\u2019s testimony and demeanor at the hearing, it is not \nunreasonable for the Judge to have found otherwise. It is not inconsistent for there to be evidence \nthat Applicant was, indeed, fired (GE 3) but for the Judge to reasonably conclude that he honestly \nbelieved he was not. The record adequately supports the Judge\u2019s favorable credibility \ndetermination with respect to Applicant\u2019s intent when completing the SCA, her finding that \nApplicant did not \u201cdeliberately falsify\u201d his answers, and her conclusion that the Government failed \nto prove intentional falsification. Department Counsel in this case has failed to carry the heavy \nburden required for the Board to challenge the Judge\u2019s credibility determination and has failed to \nestablish that the Judge\u2019s findings in this regard are erroneous, arbitrary, or capricious. \nAdditionally, Department Counsel argues \u201cin the alternative,\u201d Applicant\u2019s lack of candor \nin completing an SCA presents an independent Guideline E concern, \u201ceven if that intent [to falsify] \nwere not clear,\u201d as \u201ccandor required that Applicant divulge in his [SCA] that he was released from \nhis contract \u2018due to allegations\u2019 against him.\u201d AB at 25. To the extent that we understand this \nargument, Department Counsel suggests that\u2014when intentional or deliberate falsification of an \nSCA is not proven\u2014we may disregard the clearly defined \u201cconditions that could raise a security \nconcern\u201d and instead rely on \u201clack of candor\u201d as \u201ca broader and more flexible concept than \nfalsification\u201d to establish an allegation under Guideline E. Id. We are not persuaded. Although \nGuideline E references \u201clack of candor\u201d in its introductory section, it goes on to expressly delineate \nthe types of conduct that raise security concerns, including \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of relevant facts.\u201d We are unwilling to interpret the AG beyond its clear language to \nfind unintentional omissions as disqualifying conduct. \nMoreover, we note with concern that Department Counsel implies here, for the second time \nin their brief, that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose the circumstances surrounding his \nrelease from contract during his first investigative interview and that they characterize that \nomission as evidencing \u201ca lack of candor that would establish a Guideline E concern, even if the \nrecord did not so clearly establish his deceptive intent on his [SCA] alone.\u201d Id. at 8, 25. The \nsummary of the first investigative interview states clearly on its face that it was \u201cconducted to \ndiscuss [Applicant\u2019s] military discharge and foreign spouse/in-laws,\u201d and it is abundantly clear \nfrom review of the summary that the interview was confined to those two topics. GE 2 at 4. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s over-reaching argument with regard to this interview misrepresents the \nevidence of record. In sum, Department Counsel\u2019s argument that mitigating conditions are \nunavailable if Applicant\u2019s \u201coverall lack of candor\u201d were proven is without merit, unsupported by \nthe AG, and otherwise moot given our discussion above. \nDepartment Counsel failed to establish the Judge committed harmful error. None of their \narguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence \nor sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. The Judge\u2019s decision is sustainable on the record. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER \nThe decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: James B.

For the reasons stated below, we remand \nthe Judge\u2019s decision. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s findings of fact relevant to the Guideline I \nallegations are summarized below. \nApplicant is in her early fifties and has worked for her current employer since November \n2020. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1996, married in 2019, and has two adult stepchildren. \nThe SOR alleged as follows: \nApplicant was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in about 2010 and was treated by a \npsychiatrist until 2021. In January 2022, a DoD-contracted psychologist diagnosed her with \nbipolar disorder and an unspecified anxiety disorder (SOR \u00b6 3.a); \nApplicant discontinued her treatment and medication against medical advice and has not \nreturned to see her psychiatrist since June 2021 (SOR \u00b6 3.b); and \nApplicant was evaluated by a DoD-contracted psychologist in January 2022, who gave her \na poor prognosis and found that her judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness are likely to be \nimpaired because she discontinued treatment against medical advice, does not think she needs \nmental health interventions or medications at this time, and showed signs of hypomania during the \ninterview (SOR \u00b6 3.c). \nApplicant has sought mental health help during difficult periods of her life. As a young \nperson, she took anti-depressants after her sibling was killed in a car accident and, after a job loss \nin 2002, she saw a therapist to treat her depression. Although she has experienced depression at \ntimes, Applicant stated that she has never had a manic episode, and no one has ever expressed \nconcern that she was manic. She has never been hospitalized, accused of erratic behavior, or \ninvolved in any incidents at work. Applicant asserted that she has never been depressed without a \nreason, such as the death of a loved one or job loss. \nIn about 2011, Applicant sought psychiatric treatment after a job loss left her depressed. \nAfter a brief initial consult, she saw her psychiatrist a few times per year to renew prescriptions, \nbut she did not receive psychotherapy or counseling. Applicant testified that the psychiatrist did \nnot conduct any testing or give her a formal diagnosis, but rather that he treated her symptoms. \nThe Judge noted that \u201c[t]here is no documentation in the record from this psychiatrist showing a \ndiagnosis, prognosis, treatment plan, recommendations, or conclusions.\u201d Decision at 4. \nOver the course of her treatment with this psychiatrist, Applicant\u2019s medications included \nan anti-depressant, anxiety medication for use as needed, and a mood stabilizer. At times, \nApplicant requested to vary dosages or medications to find what worked best for her.

She had developed a better support \nsystem with her primary care physician, her mother who is an experienced nurse, and her best \nfriend who is a pharmacist. In 2021, after discussions with these advisors, Applicant started to \nwean off the mood stabilizer, in part because she discovered that it could hinder medication she \ntook for rheumatoid arthritis. Applicant advised her psychiatrist why she intended to wean off the \nmedication, and \u201che was not adamantly opposed to it.\u201d Id. at 4. In June 2021, she was completely \noff the medication and \u201cthen terminated her relationship with the psychiatrist, as he only provided \nher prescriptions, which she no longer needed from him,\u201d as she could get any necessary \nprescriptions from her primary care physician. Id. Applicant was completely off the mood \nstabilizer for six months with no problems. \nIn January 2022, Applicant met with a DoD-contracted psychologist as part of the security \nclearance process. The two had a thirty-minute online meeting, during which Applicant recalled \nbeing nervous and talking a lot about her love of gardening. Applicant also completed an online \nquestionnaire. \nOther than Applicant\u2019s [security clearance application], the specific records \nreviewed and relied upon by the DoD-connected psychologist were not identified \nor included with her report or submitted into the record for this case. The \nevaluator\u2019s report includes incorrect dates and timeline of some events, which \nundermines the findings. The report states that Applicant\u2019s former psychiatrist \nfocused on treating her symptoms and did not have an accurate diagnosis for her, \nwhich supports Applicant\u2019s testimony. \nApplicant reported that during the thirty-minute online meeting, the evaluator made \nseveral negative comments to Applicant about her medication. She had the \nimpression from the evaluator that without it she would be unable to keep her job \nor retain a security clearance. For this reason alone, after the meeting she requested \nher regular doctor re-prescribe the mood stabilizer, and she has been taking it since \nthat time. [Id. at 4\u20135 (internal citations omitted).] \nAfter receiving the SOR in May 2022, Applicant retained a psychologist for an evaluation. \nShe completed two online assessments and met with the psychologist in person \u201cfor several hours.\u201d \nId. at 5. He reported that the evaluation and the testing showed that her personality was within \nnormal limits, with no current evidence of bipolar disorder. He diagnosed her with adjustment \ndisorder with anxiety and stated that her prognosis was good and that she is reliable, stable, and \ntrustworthy. Applicant also met online with a physician, who interviewed her and reviewed her \nhealth records. He concluded that she does not have major depressive disorder and he does not \nbelieve she has bipolar affective disorder. He noted that depression affects 50% of the population \nand that medication to treat the condition as needed is appropriate. \nThree witnesses, including her supervisor and a vice president of the company, testified to \nApplicant\u2019s trustworthiness and professionalism.

She provided documentation from a \npsychologist and a physician [who] conducted more recent evaluations of her. The \npsychologist stated that she was within normal limits, she had temporary anxiety, \nand there was no current evidence of bipolar disorder. He stated that her prognosis \nwas good, and she is reliable, stable, and trustworthy. The physician and addiction \nspecialist found that she does not have major depressive disorder or a problem with \nalcohol and he does not believe she has bipolar affective disorder. \nApplicant is under her regular doctor\u2019s care and obtains medications, as needed, \nfrom her. There is sufficient evidence in the record, including her credible \ntestimony, to find that her past psychological symptoms and conditions were \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ntemporary, the situation has been resolved, and there are no current indications of \nemotional instability or indication of a current problem. \nApplicant has provided sufficient evidence showing that she proactively seeks care \nwhen she needs it. In the past she has obtained counseling and medication to treat \nfeelings of depression or anxiety. Neither are disqualifying conditions, and both are \nexperienced by the majority of the population at different times in life. Her mood \nand symptoms are under control. She has acted in good faith in seeking treatment \nand terminating treatment when it was no longer needed. The alternative would be \nto take medications forever that she no longer needs. Applicant worked with her \npsychiatrist to change her medications and dosages to best suit her. She worked \nwith him to wean off her medications and had successful outcomes. She restarted \nmedication to cope with temporary grief or anxiety, and then stopped when it was \nno longer needed, which is completely appropriate. She terminated her relationship \nwith the psychiatrist when he was no longer needed, and she sought treatment with \nother professionals she could rely on. \nIn this case there is insufficient evidence of a current problem. . . . [T]here is \ninsufficient evidence that Applicant has been erratic, unreliable, untrustworthy, had \nincidents at work or with law enforcement, or behaved in a way that was problematic. \nThe record shows she is a high achiever and professionally focused. She has the \nliberty, responsibility, and autonomy to make decisions about her health care and \nmedical providers, and the decisions she made were reasonable and appropriate. \nThis case involves differing expert opinions from mental health treatment \nproviders. The Government\u2019s evaluator only met with Applicant for a half an hour \nbefore making her assessment. Her report contains date and timeline errors, and \ndraws its conclusions and diagnoses from this information, which undermines its \ncredibility. It also contains information that supports Applicant\u2019s testimony and \ncontradicts its findings. For these reasons, I give the January 2022 report little \nweight. Applicant submitted two evaluations and a prognosis from a psychologist \nand a physician from May 2022. They each spent more time with Applicant, and \ntheir conclusions are well reasoned and credible. I find these reports to be reflective \nof the current circumstances, credible, and accurate, and give these two reports \nmore weight. [Decision at 10\u201311.] \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, the Government argues that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary and capricious, as \nhe erred in four regards, specifically: in giving insufficient weight to the DoD-contracted \npsychologist\u2019s report and too much weight to Applicant\u2019s two experts; in failing to apply \ndisqualifying condition AG \u00b6 28(d); in applying mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a), (b), (d), and \n(e); and in mis-applying the Whole-Person Concept. \nA judge\u2019s decision can be found to be arbitrary or capricious if \u201cit does not examine \nrelevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nrational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant \nfactors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it \noffers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so \nimplausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.\u201d ISCR Case No. 97-0184 at \n5, n.3 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 1998) (citing Motor Vehicle Mfr. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 463 \nU.S. 29, 43 (1983)). The Government argues that the Judge\u2019s decision fails in each regard. We \ndecline to address the full scope of the Government\u2019s arguments at this time, as our review is \nhampered by the Judge\u2019s failure to articulate a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions. The \nareas that require a fuller explanation include the following: \nDate and Timeline Errors: The central issue in the Government\u2019s appeal is the Judge\u2019s \nconclusion that Dr. B\u2019s report is due \u201clittle weight\u201d because it \u201ccontains date and timeline errors,\u201d \nand it relies upon this faulty information for its conclusions and diagnoses, which \u201cundermines its \ncredibility.\u201d Decision at 10\u201311. The Government makes two arguments in this regard: that \n\u201c[n]owhere in the Decision did the Judge identify what date or timeline errors he perceived with \nthis report\u201d and that the report contains no inconsistencies, other than a timeline discrepancy in \nDr. B\u2019s narrative that the Government attributes to Applicant. Appeal Brief at 17. \nWe agree that the Judge failed to sufficiently identify and explain the purported errors, \nwhich weakens his analysis and complicates appellate review. Our review, however, reveals \nsignificant inconsistencies between Applicant\u2019s testimony regarding her treatment history and Dr. \nL\u2019s recollection of the same, as summarized by Dr. B in her report (e.g., whether Applicant was \nalready under treatment for depression when she presented to Dr. L in 2010 and how often she \nrequested to go back on an anti-depressant after weaning herself off). It appears that the Judge may \nhave resolved those discrepancies in Applicant\u2019s favor and then concluded that Dr. L\u2019s account \nwas erroneous, as he at one juncture referenced \u201cApplicant\u2019s credible testimony about her mental \nhealth history and care\u201d being more persuasive than \u201cevidence in the record of a treatment plan \nfrom Applicant\u2019s former psychiatrist.\u201d Decision at 9. But it is unclear whether those are the \u201cerrors\u201d \nto which the Judge is referring. \nSimilarly, our review reveals inconsistencies between Dr. B\u2019s narrative of her interview \nwith Applicant and Applicant\u2019s testimony, which the Judge again may simply have resolved in \nfavor of the Applicant\u2019s account. However, the Judge\u2019s failure to identify specific errors in Dr. B\u2019s \nreport\u2014whether they were in the summary of Dr. L\u2019s interview or in Dr. B\u2019s own findings\u2014leaves \nus guessing at what errors the Judge was referring to and speculating as to how he resolved the \ndiscrepancies between the report and Applicant\u2019s testimony. This constitutes error on his part. As \nwe have previously stated, the Judge\u2019s decision must be written in a manner that allows the parties \nand the Board to discern what findings the Judge is making and what conclusions he is reaching. \nE.g., ISCR Case No. 17-00944 at 4\u20135, n.4 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2019). \nUnspecified \u201cInformation\u201d: In a closely related issue, the Government challenges the \nJudge\u2019s conclusion that Dr. B\u2019s report \u201ccontains information that supports Applicant\u2019s testimony \nand contradicts its findings.\u201d The Government again highlights that the Judge did not explain this \nconclusion and argues that the conclusion is without basis in the record. We concur that the Judge \nerred in that he did not specify what in Dr. B\u2019s report was internally inconsistent. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to Identify Applicant\u2019s \u201cCondition\u201d in Mitigation Analysis: The Government \nchallenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a), (b), (d), and (e) apply. \nA fundamental problem in resolving the Government\u2019s appeal is that the Judge did not specify \nwhat \u201ccondition\u201d he believed to have been mitigated. Said differently, the Judge determined that, \nunder AG \u00b6 29(a), the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment and there is \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan; that, under AG \u00b6 29(b), Applicant has voluntarily \nentered a counseling or treatment program for a condition that is amenable to treatment; and that, \nunder AG \u00b629(d), Applicant\u2019s past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary and the \nsituation has been resolved. But the Judge never clearly articulated to which diagnosis he was \nreferring. Additionally, the Judge\u2019s finding that AG \u00b6 29(a) is applicable appears inconsistent with \nhis conclusion that disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 28(d) did not apply because the Government did \nnot present sufficient \u201cevidence in the record of a treatment plan from Applicant\u2019s former \npsychiatrist to rebut Applicant\u2019s credible testimony about her mental health care history and care.\u201d \nOne of the more problematic aspects of this record that further obscures our ability to assess \nthe Judge\u2019s analysis is the fact that he did not address the details of the Government\u2019s \npsychological evaluation when finding it to be less persuasive than the one offered by Applicant\u2019s \nexpert. For reasons not disclosed in the record, the Government did not obtain Applicant\u2019s \ntreatment records from Dr. L and submit them to Dr. B for her review. Instead, Dr. B conducted a \ntelephone interview of Dr. L and summarized that conversation in her report.1 If we are to accept \nDr. B\u2019s summary as accurate, Applicant\u2019s treating psychiatrist of ten years stated that Applicant \n\u201cpresents with bipolar (most likely type II or else a mixed type).\u201d Government Exhibit (GE) 4 at \n3 and 7. Based on her interviews of Applicant and Dr. L, Dr. B rendered two diagnoses: \u201cBipolar \ndisorder\u201d and \u201cUnspecified anxiety disorder.\u201d Id. at 6. After receipt of the SOR, Applicant sought \na psychological evaluation from Dr. P, who found \u201cno evidence that she has a current diagnosis of \nBipolar Disorder\u201d and diagnosed her with adjustment disorder with anxiety, which he opined was \n\u201ca temporary disorder related to anxiety caused by her clearance as not being approved.\u201d Applicant \nExhibit I at 2. \nCompounding the lack of clarity regarding the competing mental health assessments, the \ndiagnoses submitted in the Government\u2019s psychological evaluation are not the standard, \nrecognizable diagnoses that Administrative Judges typically receive and for which they can take \nadministrative notice of the relevant sections of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \nDisorders, 5th edition. (DSM-5). Putting aside the diagnosis of anxiety disorder as not typically of \nsecurity concern, 2 we note that Dr. B\u2019s generic diagnosis of \u201cbipolar disorder\u201d is not a diagnosis \n1 As the Judge noted, \u201c[t]here is no documentation in the record from this psychiatrist showing a diagnosis, prognosis, \ntreatment plan, recommendations, or conclusions.\u201d Decision at 4. It is unclear from Dr. B\u2019s report whether Dr. L was \nreferring to his notes while speaking to her or relying on his recollection. \n2 In November 2016, DNI issued a memorandum revising the mental health questions in Section 21 of Standard Form \n86, the security clearance application (SCA). DNI Memorandum on Revisions to the Psychological and Emotional \nHealth Questions on the Standard Form 86, Questionnaire for National Security Positions, dated November 16, 2016. \nAs revised, the SCA lists the psychological disorders that are considered by their very nature to raise security concerns: \nPsychotic Disorder, Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, Delusional Disorder, Bipolar Mood Disorder, \nBorderline Personality Disorder, and Antisocial Personality Disorder.

For example, the Judge found that \u201cApplicant provided sufficient evidence \nto show that her condition is under control and in remission and that she is now stable,\u201d3 but did \nnot articulate which of these diagnoses was the condition that is amenable to treatment and now \nunder control. Decision at 10. The Judge hints at a conclusion that he discounted the bipolar \ndisorder diagnosis in stating that Applicant had in the past \u201cobtained counseling and medication \nto treat feelings of depression or anxiety,\u201d noting that neither is a disqualifying condition.\u201d Id. \nNevertheless, his failure to state explicitly whether he discounted the bipolar disorder diagnosis \nand to articulate a satisfactory explanation for that conclusion is error. \nIn sum, the Judge failed to write his decision in a manner that allows us to discern what \nfindings he made and what conclusions he reached in the areas noted above. We conclude that the \nbest resolution of this case is to remand the case to the Judge to correct the identified errors. The \nJudge may sua sponte or upon motion of either party reopen the record to better address the \nidentified issues. Upon remand, a judge is required to issue a new decision.

The majority conclude, and I agree, that the Judge\u2019s \nfailure to identify the purported errors constitutes harmful error that must be cured on remand. I \ndisagree, however, with several matters related to this conclusion. \nIn its analysis about the report\u2019s purported \u201cerrors,\u201d the majority identifies multiple \n\u201csignificant inconsistencies\u201d in the evidence. These evidentiary conflicts were wholly unaddressed \nby the Judge, and I agree that they must be addressed on remand. See ISCR Case No. 05-06723 at \n4 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2007) (When conflicts exist within the record, a judge must weigh the \nevidence and resolve such conflicts based upon a careful evaluation of factors such as the \nevidence\u2019s \u201ccomparative reliability, plausibility and ultimate truthfulness.\u201d). \nThe majority\u2019s identification of the aforementioned evidentiary conflicts in its discussion \nabout the report\u2019s alleged \u201cerrors,\u201d however, is unnecessarily suggestive. The Judge did not assert \nthat the report offered conflicting information from other record evidence, but rather specifically \nasserted that it contained \u201cerrors.\u201d If the Judge indeed found \u201cerrors\u201d in the report, he should \nidentify them on remand \u2013 independently \u2013 before proceeding to his weighing analysis. \nI also disagree with the majority\u2019s repeated speculation that the Judge \u201cmay simply have \nresolved\u201d the inconsistencies in Applicant\u2019s favor. Whether or not the \u201csignificant inconsistencies\u201d \nidentified by the majority are the \u201cerrors\u201d relied upon by the Judge, the Board should not \nhypothesize about the Judge\u2019s unknown weighing analysis if that analysis is a defect assigned to \nbe cured on remand. \nSigned: Allison Marie \nAllison Marie \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \n10 \n",

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nSamir Nakhleh, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMay 5, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal \nConduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. Prior to the hearing, the Government amended the \nSOR, adding an additional allegation under Guideline E. On May 17, 2024, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Eric C. Price denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For reasons stated \nbelow, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged six delinquent debts. Under Guideline E, the SOR \nalleged: that Applicant was charged in approximately 19 separate incidents between 1999 and \n2019; that he falsely claimed to be married while onboarding with an employer in 2019 in order \nto secure spousal insurance benefits for a person to whom he was not married; and that he was \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nterminated for cause from another employer in 2022. Applicant admitted all allegations other \nthan the 2022 termination for cause. The Judge found for Applicant on two relatively minor \ndebts and against him on all other allegations. \nOn appeal, Applicant alleges that the Administrative Judge improperly applied factual \nfindings that were unsupported in the record and that the Judge \u201cdid not consider facts that were \nfavorable and highly dispositive on the [Applicant\u2019s] current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment.\u201d Appeal Brief (AB) at 11. Our review of the Judge\u2019s decision confirms that he \nconsidered all relevant issues and properly applied the mitigating conditions. Consistent with the \nfollowing, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant is in his mid-forties and has one minor child. He has completed some college \ncourse work but has not earned a degree. He has been employed since 2007 with two gaps in \nemployment: he was unemployed from about June 2015 to August 2017 because of an injury and \nwas unemployed from about February 2020 until September 2022 while between jobs or because \nof COVID 19. \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling approximately $47,380, including three \ncharged-off vehicle loans totaling $43,475. Applicant attributes his financial problems to \nunemployment and underemployment, and his financial circumstances have significantly \nimproved in the past several years. He has saved more than $160,000, paid smaller or more recent \ndebts, and rebuilt his credit score. He has stated his ability and willingness to resolve all the \nalleged debts. \nRegarding the auto loan charged off for $22,770 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), credit reports reflect that \nthe loan account was opened in September 2018, the last payment was in May 2019, and the \naccount was charged off with a past-due balance of $22,770. Applicant testified that he realized \nafter signing the loan agreement that the interest rate was about 25 percent; that he contacted the \ncreditor to renegotiate terms; and that he put the vehicle in storage when the creditor refused. \nApplicant did not recall if he ever made a payment on the loan. Applicant also stated that this \nloan was part of a class action lawsuit for predatory lending, for which he received about $900. \nHe understood if he started making payments or returned the vehicle it could harm his credit and \nrestart a seven-year statute of limitations and so was unsure of the right course of action. After \nthe hearing, Applicant settled and paid the debt for $10,000. \nThree other debts are for a credit card charged off for $3,245 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and two auto \nloans charged off for $6,879 and $13,826 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.f). For all three, Applicant stated that he \nnegotiated settlement agreements in 2022 because his employer\u2019s facility security officer (FSO) \ntold him it would resolve security concerns about the debts, but that he made no payments under \nthe settlement agreements. After the hearing, Applicant submitted a written statement in which he \nclaimed these debts are no longer on his credit report and are resolved but submitted no \ndocuments to support his claims. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR includes three allegations. The first is that Applicant was \ncriminally charged in about 19 incidents from 1999 to 2019 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Upon his review of the \nevidence, the Judge clarified as follows: \nRecords show 20 charges or citations arising from 15 incidents from April \n2002 to April 2019. Applicant has been charged or cited with nine vehicular or \ntraffic offenses including DUI of alcohol or possession of illegal drugs (August \n2009). He pled guilty to driving on a suspended driver\u2019s license (2003), speeding \n(2007, 2011, and May 2019), an improper driver\u2019s license (2011) and his driver\u2019s \nlicense was suspended for failure to pay a fine and court costs (June 2019). He \nwas convicted of domestic violence twice in 2003. (GE 5 at 6-7), In January 2015 \nhe was convicted of petty larceny, ordered to pay a fine and assessments of $530 \nand issued a no contact order. He said his attorney alleged he stole her cell phone \nwhich he denied. He was charged with possession of marijuana (2002), \nacquisition of by theft, unlawful sale, purchase or receipt of credit cards (2002), \ndisorderly conduct and disobeying a police officer (2011), disorderly conduct \n(2011) and possession of a controlled substance, and malicious mischief (July \n2016). [Decision at 5 (internal cites omitted).] \nApplicant admitted the allegation, explaining that he grew up in a small town in a well-\nto-do family with a fast car and a motorcycle and that most charges were traffic violations and \nultimately dismissed. His most recent involvement with law enforcement occurred when he was \npulled over for speeding in about June 2019 while driving to a job interview. He testified that he \nhas changed his life and has not had any involvement with law enforcement since 2019. \nThe second allegation under Guideline E is that Applicant falsely claimed to be married \nwhile onboarding with Company A in about October 2019, in an attempt to fraudulently obtain \nspousal insurance benefits for a person not his wife (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant admitted the \nallegation, with the explanation that his girlfriend helped him fill out his benefits enrollment \npaperwork and listed herself on the forms without his knowledge. He denied intentionally \nmisleading his employer about his marital status. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s assertions, the Judge \nfound as follows: \nI do not find Applicant\u2019s claims that he did not intentionally or knowingly \nclaim to be married to his then girlfriend credible. His testimony and demeanor \nduring the hearing were unconvincing, inconsistent with someone who was \nreliably telling the truth, and contradicted in significant part by documentary \nevidence. I find that he falsely claimed to be married to fraudulently obtain \nspousal insurance benefits for a person not his wife. [Id. at 6 (internal cites \nomitted).] \nThe final allegation under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 2.c) is that Applicant was terminated for \ncause by Company B in about June 2022 for conduct and behavior that included failing to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \ncomply with required document submissions and inappropriate text messages to other employees \nand that, upon termination, Applicant refused to return his DOD issued Common Access Card \n(CAC). Applicant denied this allegation and the related behavior and stated that he walked off \nthe job. Applicant testified that he did not return his CAC immediately because he did not trust \ncompany personnel and that he returned it several days later to the site where it was issued. The \nGovernment\u2019s evidence supports the allegation as drafted. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and record evidence establish three disqualifying conditions \nunder Guideline F: an inability to satisfy debts, an unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of \nability to do so, and a history of not meeting financial obligations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a)\u2013(c). None of the \nmitigating conditions are established for the four debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.f. While \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment and underemployment were conditions beyond his control, he did not \nact responsibly under the circumstances. Although he had the financial resources to pay the debts \nfor the past few years, he has largely chosen to ignore them. \nAlthough Applicant reached an agreement to settle the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($22,770) and authorized payment of the $10,000 settlement amount in \nDecember 2023, his actions do not warrant full mitigative credit. He placed the \nvehicle subject of this delinquent loan in storage after his request to renegotiate \nloan terms was denied, made no payments on the loan for at least four and a half \nyears, and then entered an agreement to settle and authorized payment only after \nhis hearing. The timing of an applicant\u2019s actions, including repayment of \ndelinquent debts, impacts upon the degree to which the mitigating factors apply. \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.f. (totaling $23,130) are long-standing \nand ongoing. Applicant has made no payment on any of these debts since at least \nSeptember 2018. Although he negotiated settlement agreements for each debt in \n2022, there is insufficient evidence to find he adhered to a good-faith effort to \nresolve them because he made no payments under those agreements and apparently \nnever intended to. That these debts have dropped off recent credit reports is not \nmeaningful evidence of debt resolution. The security concerns established by \nApplicant\u2019s ongoing delinquent debts are not mitigated. [Id. at 9\u201310 (internal cites \nomitted).] \nTurning to the Guideline E allegations, disqualifying conditions are established by \nApplicant\u2019s criminal history, his false claim to fraudulently secure employment-related insurance \nbenefits, his termination for cause because of inappropriate conduct, and his refusal to return his \nCAC card upon termination. None of the mitigating conditions are fully established. Applicant \nhas demonstrated \u201ca pattern of questionable judgment and unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations.\u201d Id. at 12. Although Applicant\u2019s last criminal conduct occurred more than five \nyears ago, his troubling personal conduct in 2019 and 2022 and his failure to take responsibility \nfor that conduct makes it difficult to conclude that such behavior is unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nexplanation for why he left Company A was \u201cuncorroborated and not credible\u201d and \u201chis \ncontinued false denial of this conduct shows he is still vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, \nand duress.\u201d Id. His termination for cause by Company B would not, standing alone, necessarily \nbe of security concern, but the disruptive and inappropriate behavior that resulted in his \ntermination and his conduct post-termination are not mitigated. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s factual findings as well as his conclusions. \nWhen an administrative judge\u2019s factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine \nwhether the findings of fact are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record \nand whether the judge\u2019s findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a \nwhole. Directive, E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 2\u20133 (App Bd. Aug. 8, 2005). In \ndeciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the decision to \ndetermine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory \nexplanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to \nconsider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs \ncontrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere \ndifference of opinion. ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998). \nApplicant alleges several factual errors in the decision. For example, with regard to the \nauto loan at issue in SOR \u00b6 1.c, Applicant asserts as a factual error that the Judge \u201cfailed to \nconsider the lengthy and drawn-out class action lawsuit against the predatory lender and the \nresponsible actions taken by [Applicant] in keeping the vehicle in a safe location . . . until the \nclass action lawsuit was complete, and a settlement offer was given.\u201d Appeal Brief (AB) at 12. \nThrough his Counsel, Applicant further asserts that his \u201cwithholding of payment was not due to \nthe lack of taking on the debt as a responsibility; rather he was waiting until the \u201cdust settled\u201d on \nthe predatory lending lawsuit.\u201d Id. \nLike Counsel\u2019s other assertions of factual error, this challenge largely conflates \"facts\" \nwith \"conclusions.\" Regardless of which standard is applied, however, this allegation of error is \nwholly without merit. The record establishes that the lawsuit against the predatory lender had \nnothing to do with Applicant\u2019s failure to pay on the auto loan. Applicant himself testified at \nhearing: \u201cI was unaware there was even a class action lawsuit.

Contrary to Applicant\u2019s argument, the \nJudge\u2019s findings and conclusions regarding this debt are amply supported by the record.  \nRegarding the other two auto loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f), Applicant asserts that they were \n\u201cresponsibly addressed\u201d in that he entered into settlement agreements for both in May 2022 on \nadvice of his FSO and, although he made no payments under the agreements, the debts have \napparently \u201cfall[en] off his credit report due to age.\u201d AB at 6\u20137.

His conclusion \u201c[t]hat these debts have \ndropped off recent credit reports is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution\u201d is firmly rooted in \nthe Appeal Board precedent to which he cites. Decision at 10. \nTurning to the Guideline E allegations, Applicant identifies the Judge\u2019s adverse \ncredibility determination as \u201cinseparable\u201d from his findings and challenges that unfavorable \ndetermination: \u201cBecause the Judge found [Applicant] to be not credible, he concluded that the \npersonal concerns listed were indeed factual, and consequently, the Judge erred in determining \nthat SOR 2.a\u20132.c was found against [Applicant].\u201d AB at 13. The Directive requires the Appeal \nBoard to give deference to a judge\u2019s credibility determination. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. While that \ndeference has its limits, there is nothing in this record or Applicant\u2019s brief that gives us any \nreason to question the Judge\u2019s adverse determination. The Judge was also well within his \nauthority to consider that determination in assessing whether Applicant successfully rehabilitated \nhimself, in evaluating whether he mitigated the Guideline E security concerns, and in conducting \nhis Whole Person assessment. When an applicant is unwilling or unable to accept responsibility \nfor his own actions, such a failure is evidence that detracts from a finding of reform and \nrehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 21-00321 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 8, 2022). \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief advocates for an alternative weighing of the evidence. \nAn applicant\u2019s \u201cdisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for \na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed \nthe evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Moreover, there is a rebuttable \npresumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states \notherwise, and a bare assertion that the Judge did not consider evidence is not sufficient to rebut \nthat presumption. E.g., ISCR Case No. 19-03344 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2020). \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel has failed to establish any harmful error below. The record supports \na conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is \nthat a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Consistent with the \nfollowing, we remand. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is a cyber-operations analyst in his mid-thirties who has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since September 2022. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 2009 \nto 2017, and in the Reserve from 2017 to 2020. He was honorably discharged. Applicant was twice \nmarried and twice divorced as a result of proceedings that he initiated. In 2017, while married to \nhis first wife, he was charged with domestic abuse. The criminal charges were dismissed when she \ndid not appear at the hearing. In 2019 and 2020 Applicant was charged with domestic \nabuse/violence as a result of alleged altercations with his second wife. The criminal charges were \ndismissed after she did not appear at the hearings. Applicant testified that the charges were \ndismissed because his former spouses failed to appear and that, \"I just didn't do the crime\" and that \n\"there wasn't any proof that I actually did these (offenses).\" Decision at 3. All three arrests were \nsubsequently expunged under a state statue that provides for expungement upon written \napplication if the individual was arrested  or charged, but not convicted of a crime. \nConcurrent with the 2017 arrest, Applicant\u2019s then-wife sought a Protective Order. She was \ngranted a TRO that was later vacated at her request. After the 2020 arrest, Applicant\u2019s second wife \nsought and was granted a TRO that was later vacated at her request. In November 2021, Applicant \nsought a TRO against his second wife. It was granted, followed by an 8-year Protective Order, \nwhich was granted in an uncontested proceeding. \nThe Judge concluded that the Government had established possible concerns under \nDisqualifying Conditions \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) under Guideline J.1 He also concluded that the record \nevidence established possible concerns under Disqualifying Condition \u00b6 16(c) of Guideline E.2 \nAddressing potential mitigation, the Judge found that a review of the facts supported partial \napplication of Guideline J Mitigating Condition \u00b6 32(a) and full application of \u00b6\u00b6 32(c) and 32(d).3 \n1 AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely to affect a national security \neligibility decision, but which in combination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official record) of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n2 AG \u00b6 16(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole\u00adperson \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected \ninformation. \n3 AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; (c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; and (d) there is evidence of \nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the Judge also found that Mitigating Conditions \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), (d), and (e) partially \napplied and that \u00b6 17(f) fully applied.4 \nDiscussion \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998). \nIn this case, the SOR alleged that applicant was arrested on three separate occasions and \ncharged with domestic violence/abuse offenses and that two TROs were granted against him. \nApplicant admitted to the arrests and TROs thus relieving the Government of producing additional \nevidence as to the specific allegations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. ISCR Case 07-13766 at 3 (App. Bd. \nNov. 12, 2008). Although the SOR did not detail the language of the charges or the specific conduct \nthat resulted in the arrests or TROs, implicit in allegations of this nature is that there is evidence \nof underlying conduct that would elaborate on the circumstances and detail why the conduct is \ndisqualifying under the Guidelines. Therefore, because Applicant denied any wrongdoing in his \nanswer to the SOR, it was incumbent upon the Government to present evidence of specific conduct. \nIn instances in which cases do not proceed to trial, a police report typically provides \ninsightful information regarding circumstances surrounding arrests, both from the standpoint of \ncomplainants and from the neutral observations of law enforcement officers or witnesses. See \nISCR Case No. 20-00347 at 7 (App. Bd. Aug 11, 2021); ISCR Case No. 07-10158 at 4-5 (App. \nBd. Aug. 28, 2008). Although the Government did not submit any law enforcement records in \nsupport of its case, the Government\u2019s evidence included detailed petitions for TROs/Protective \nOrders submitted under penalty of perjury by both of Applicant\u2019s former wives. GE 5 & 6; AE E \n& F. Thus, there was evidence that Applicant committed various specific acts of domestic violence. \nThe decision briefly references this evidence but summarily dismisses it because the former \nspouses did not testify at the hearing. Decision at 8-9. \nThe dismissal of charges against an applicant does not preclude a Judge from finding that \nthe underlying conduct occurred. Indeed, it can be error for a Judge to conclude that the dismissal \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher education, good employment \nrecord, or constructive community involvement. \n4 AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; (d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed \nto untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; (e) the individual \nhas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and (f) the \ninformation was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof charges means that the defendant was innocent inasmuch as there are many reasons why a \nprosecution might not go forward. A dismissal or expungement does not eliminate the security \nconcerns arising from disqualifying conduct because the evidentiary standard in a DOHA \nproceeding is entirely different from that in a criminal proceeding. DOHA security clearance \nadjudications are administrative proceedings, and the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d burden of proof \nassociated with criminal proceedings is not applicable. ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 2 (Dec. 27, \n1999). Similarly, the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard in civil proceedings such as a TRO \nis not applicable. The correct assessment of the underlying facts must be made within the context \nof the substantial evidence standard in DOHA proceedings \u2013 such relevant evidence as a \nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support conclusions in light of all contrary evidence \nin the same record. \nCharges can be dismissed for any number of reasons that are consistent with guilt, and the \nmere fact that a court dismisses charges does not in and of itself justify a conclusion that an \napplicant did not commit the conduct in question. See ISCR Case No. 18-02018 at 4 (App. Bd. \nNov. 4, 2021) (\u201c[T]he decision by the law enforcement authorities in this case not to pursue \ncriminal charges against Applicant due to the mother's decision not to let her daughter testify does \nnot amount to a finding of \u201cnot guilty\u201d or a determination of innocence.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14\u00ad\n02567 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 5, 2015). A disqualifying condition at issue in this case specifically \nhighlights this point. Under Disqualifying Condition \u00b6 31(b), a security concern could arise from \n\u201cevidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official \nrecord) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, \nprosecuted, or convicted. (Emphasis added). E.g. ISCR Case No. 18-02018 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, \n2021). Similarly, under the applicable state statute, expungement is not a reflection of innocence \nas it is mandatory in cases in which charges are dismissed. Absent record evidence of the specific \nreasons why criminal charges are not pursued, a judge cannot legitimately make assumptions or \ndraw inferences about the reasons state authorities dropped the charges. ISCR Case No. 20-00347 \nat 7 (App. Bd. Aug 11, 2021), citing ISCR Case No. 99-0360 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 1997). \nTherefore, it was incumbent upon the Judge to have weighed the entirety of the evidence \nindependent of the outcome in any criminal or civil proceeding. \nA security clearance decision must be based upon a reasonable interpretation of the record \nevidence viewed as a cumulative whole, and a judge is presumed to have considered all of the \nevidence in the record. A judge is not required to discuss each and every piece of record evidence \nin making a decision, but the judge cannot ignore, disregard, or fail to discuss significant record \nevidence that a reasonable person could expect to be taken into account in reaching a fair and \nreasoned decision. ISCR Case No. 21-01551 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2022) Simply because an \napplicant offers an explanation of events, an administrative judge should not accept this \nexplanation without considering evidence that fairly detracts from it. E.g. ISCR Case No. 97-0184 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 8, 1998). \nAfter concluding that the evidence established \u201cpossible concerns\u201d under Guideline J \nDisqualifying Conditions \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b), and under Guideline E Disqualifying Condition \u00b6 \n16(c), the Judge addressed mitigation and found that there was \u201c\u2026not reliable evidence to support \na finding that the allegations occurred as alleged. In short, Applicant refuted the allegations.\u201d \nDecision at 6. The Judge reached this conclusion by focusing on Applicant\u2019s claims of innocence, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe dismissal of the charges, and the expungement of the arrests without addressing or considering \nthe substance of the allegations in the women\u2019s TRO petitions. In doing so, he relied upon a \nfavorable credibility determination that ignored contradictory record evidence. \nWhile the Board is required to give deference to a judge's credibility determinations, \ndeference is not absolute. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. A judge is expected to explain why an applicant's \nversion of an event is worthy of belief when it is contradicted by other evidence. Failure to do so \nsuggests that the judge merely substituted a favorable impression of an applicant's demeanor for \nrecord evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-01926 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2019). A credibility \ndetermination may be set aside or reversed if it is unreasonable, contradicts other findings, is based \non an inadequate reason, is patently without basis in the record, or is inherently improbable or \ndiscredited by undisputed fact. See ISCR Case No. 97-0184 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 8. 1998). \u201cWhen \na witness's story is contradicted by other evidence or is so internally inconsistent or implausible \nthat a reasonable fact finder would not credit it, we can find error despite the deference owed a \nJudge's credibility determination.\u201d ISCR Case No. 10-03886 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr 26, 2012), citing \nAnderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564 at 575 (1985). When the record contains a basis to \nquestion an applicant's credibility, including contrary record evidence, the judge should address \nthat aspect of the record explicitly, explaining why he finds an applicant's version of events to be \nworthy of belief. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016). In this instance, \nthe Judge\u2019s perfunctory mention of the former spouses\u2019 allegations in the TRO petitions, which \nindependently reflect similar allegations of domestic violence, constitutes a failure to adequately \nconsider significant evidence contrary to Applicant\u2019s assertions. This error is harmful because it \nundercuts the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Mitigating Conditions \u00b6 32 (c) and \u00b6 17(f) apply. Decision \nat 6, 7. C.f. ISCR Case No. 20-00347 at 7 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, 2021). \nMoreover, a DOHA judge must consider the evidence as a whole, rather than in a piecemeal \nmanner, in rendering a decision. In terms of corroboration and credibility of the contrary evidence, \nthe Judge took a piecemeal approach and failed to address the significance of the fact that similar \nallegations were lodged by two different women, years apart.. Directive \u00b6 6.3. Similar allegations \nmade against an applicant by different accusers may add weight to the validity of those accusations. \nSee ISCR Case No. 14-01763 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2015) (pattern of domestic violence \nallegations). While the former spouses were not present at the hearing to provide testimony, their \nstatements given under penalty of perjury in a civil judicial proceeding are entitled to significant \nweight and cannot be ignored simply because the proponents of those statements are not present \nat the hearing. The Judge did not assess the contents of those statements individually and in context \nwith each other, nor did he explain why he discounted evidence which, on its face, would suggest \nthat Applicant's version of events was self-serving. See ISCR Case No. 14-02567 at 5-6 (App. Bd. \nOct. 5, 2015); ISCR Case No. 07-10158 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2008). Moreover, his comment \nthat the TRO obtained by applicant \u201cis quite an extraordinary outcome in today's environment\u201d is \nunsupported by any evidence and appears to reflect a personal mindset that, in part, may have \nformed the basis for the Judge\u2019s favorable credibility determination. \nAlthough he found Applicant\u2019s assertions of innocence to be credible \u2013 albeit based upon \nan incomplete assessment of the evidence \u2013 the Judge also applied other Mitigating Conditions in \na manner that is inconsistent with his conclusion that Applicant had refuted the allegations. If the \nassaults did not occur, it is incongruous to find that they happened under such unusual \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances that they are unlikely to recur and that Applicant has shown evidence of successful \nrehabilitation. It is particularly erroneous to find that Applicant has rehabilitated himself inasmuch \nas he denies any wrongdoing. An applicant's refusal to acknowledge his misconduct or accept \nresponsibility for it seriously undercuts a finding that the applicant has mitigated his misconduct. \nISCR Case No. 03-01009 at fn. 7 (Mar. 29, 2005). Even if the Judge had correctly concluded that \nother Mitigating Conditions potentially applied, the analysis lacks any specificity explaining the \nfactual basis for why he found them applicable. It does not follow that domestic violence is not \nlikely to recur because \u201cApplicant is no longer married,\u201d inasmuch as domestic violence is not \nlimited to married couples. The simplistic analysis of Mitigating Condition \u00b6 32 (a) in this manner \nignores the conjunctive clause, \u201cand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d As such it does not consider the overall significance of the \nconduct. The purpose of this adjudication is to assess Applicant\u2019s character as well as speculate as \nto whether he might commit further offenses. \nConclusion \nWe conclude that the best resolution is to remand the case to the Judge to correct the above-\nidentified harmful errors and for further processing consistent with the Directive. Upon remand, a \nJudge is required to issue a new decision. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35. The Board retains no jurisdiction \nover a remanded decision. However, the Judge\u2019s decision issued after remand may be appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.130. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER \nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REMANDED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Gregg A.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nCarl Anthony Marrone, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMay 5, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On December 29, 2023, after the hearing, \nAdministrative Judge Eric C. Price denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant owed about $150,000 for seven delinquent debts, the \nlargest of which was a mortgage account foreclosed for about $124,000. Applicant denied all \nallegations. The Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor on all but one of the allegations \u2013 a consumer \ndebt originally charged off for about $17,000. \nOn appeal, Applicant raised the following issues: whether the Judge erroneously required \nApplicant to be debt free, whether the Judge substituted an unfavorable credibility determination \nfor record evidence, and whether the Judge unreasonably weighed the timing of Applicant\u2019s debt \nresolution efforts. Appeal Brief at 1. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his early forties, has some college credits, and holds numerous information \ntechnology (IT) certifications. He married his current wife in 2022, and he is previously divorced \nand has two children with his former spouse. He has been employed by government contractors in \nvarious IT positions since 2007, except for periods of unemployment from March 2017 to July \n2017 and August 2021 to October 2021. From March 2014 to November 2015, Applicant worked \npart-time while unsuccessfully attempting to start his own business. He has held a security \nclearance since 2009 and submitted his most recent security clearance application (SCA) on \nJanuary 17, 2020. He attributes his delinquencies to his divorce, failed business, and periods of \nunemployment. \nApplicant provided the Judge with evidence that the mortgage foreclosure alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.a was resolved in 2015. Applicant also provided evidence that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \nthrough 1.g were settled at various dates in 2021 and 2023. The Judge resolved each of those \nallegations in favor of Applicant despite concluding that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) were not \nfully established and that AG \u00b6 20(c) was not established at all. \nAs to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant maintained that he had entered into a \nsettlement agreement and had made monthly payments. After the hearing, he presented a letter \ndated February 26, 2022, indicating that the balance had increased to $26,662 and that he had \nauthorized automatic $100 monthly payments beginning in March 2022. He stated that the \nautomatic withdrawals stopped in December 2022 and the debt dropped from his credit report. The \nJudge found against Applicant as to this account, concluding that Applicant had not made good \nfaith efforts to address the debt. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant contends that the Judge \u201cdemanded complete resolution of all debt\u201d \nand gave \u201cdispositive weight to the timing\u201d of Applicant\u2019s efforts. Appeal Brief at 3, 5. The Judge \naddressed each of Applicant\u2019s debts and concluded that, while the efforts to settle them were \nsufficiently mitigating to resolve most of the specific debts, the majority of those efforts occurred \nafter submitting his security clearance application and after addressing the debts with a government \ninvestigator. His favorable conclusion regarding the individual resolved debts did not preclude the \nJudge from weighing the manner in which Applicant addressed his SOR debts and the independent \nsecurity significance of his remaining, largely unaddressed outstanding debt. \nDOHA proceedings are not aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s debts. Rather, \u201ca security \nclearance adjudication is designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and \ntrustworthiness so that a sound decision is rendered.\u201d ISCR Case No. 10-03020, 2011 WL 2937329 \nat *2 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2011). Turning first to the debts found in Applicant\u2019s favor, the Judge \nconcluded that, \u201c[a]lthough [Applicant] subsequently resolved five of the six remaining SOR \ndebts, he did so only after submitting a SCA in January 2020 and after discussing his financial \nissues with a government investigator.\u201d Decision at 8.

See ISCR Case No. 14-02394, 2015 WL 5184614 at *3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2015). As part of his analysis of Applicant\u2019s overall financial history, the Judge \ncorrectly considered that the timing of debt payments is relevant in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case \nfor mitigation, in that an applicant who waits until his clearance is in jeopardy before resolving \ndebts might be lacking in the judgment expected of those with access to classified information. \nSee ISCR Case No. 15-01070, 2016 WL 2843113 at *3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2016). The presence of \nsome favorable or mitigating evidence does not require the Judge to make an overall favorable \ndetermination in the face of disqualifying conduct such as Applicant\u2019s. See ISCR Case No. 01\u00ad\n07292, 2004 WL 794251 at *3 (App. Bd. Jan. 29, 2004). \nWith respect to SOR \u00b6 1(b), the Judge concluded that Applicant ignored the remaining debt \nfor many years as the delinquency grew from about $17,000 to over $26,000, that he made only a \nlimited effort to address it in December 2021 when faced with the loss of his clearance, that he \nfailed to provide documentation supporting any payments made pursuant to the agreement, and \nthat he ceased participating in the payment plan in December 2022 with no further action. Decision \nat 8. Those findings are supported by the evidence and it was not error for the Judge to find that \nthis did not constitute a good faith effort in addressing the debt to afford mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n20(d). To receive full credit under AG \u00b6 20(d), an applicant must initiate and adhere \u201cto a good \nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d In the absence of a meaningful \ntrack record of repayments, it cannot reasonably be suggested that an applicant has initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay creditors or otherwise resolve debts. See ISCR Case No. 07-09304, 2008 \nWL 4917777 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2008). Nor did the Judge err in finding no mitigation under \nAG \u00b6 20(a), noting that Applicant\u2019s multiple failed opportunities to provide corroborating \ndocumentation of his purported repayment efforts impugned his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nTo the extent that Applicant asserts that the Judge substituted an adverse credibility \ndetermination for record evidence, there is no factual basis for this assertion. There is no dispute \nas to the facts surrounding this debt and Applicant simply argues for a different weighing of the \nevidence. \nWe find that the Judge addressed Applicant\u2019s circumstances and debt resolution efforts in \nhis decision and reasonably concluded that Applicant had not established a sufficient record of \npayments and responsible financial conduct. Applicant\u2019s \u201cdisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing \nof the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient \nto demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d ISCR Case No. 06-17409, 2007 WL 4105312 at *2 (App. \nBd. Oct. 12, 2007). Moreover, Applicant\u2019s arguments fail to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the record evidence. The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant failed to mitigate the \nfinancial security concerns is sustainable. \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision. The decision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance \nmay be granted only when \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro Se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nNovember 7, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a hearing. On March 5, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge Robert Robinson Gales denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged seven financial concerns: that Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nin 2013 that was converted to a Chapter 7; that she failed to file federal and state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2015 through 2021; that she was indebted to the federal government for delinquent \ntaxes of approximately $47,800; that she was indebted to her state government for delinquent taxes \nof approximately $18,100; and that she was delinquent on a medical account and two consumer \naccounts. The Judge found favorably for Applicant on two allegations\u2014her federal tax \ndelinquency and the medical account debt\u2014and adversely on the remaining allegations.

For the reasons detailed below, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s findings of fact relevant to the adverse findings \nare summarized and quoted below. \nApplicant is in her early forties and has been serving as a senior program manager and \nbudget analyst with her current employer since 2015. She graduated from high school in the late \nnineties and served on active duty for four years and in the reserve force for three more. She has \nheld security clearances of varying levels since about 2002. Applicant married in 2012 and \ndivorced in 2014, and she remarried in 2016 and divorced in 2017. The Judge stated that \n\u201cApplicant has had a lengthy history of financial troubles that commenced before June 2013\u201d \n(Decision at 3) and made the following findings regarding the individual allegations: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to a Chapter 13 bankruptcy that was filed in 2013 but subsequently \nconverted to a Chapter 7 filing, with a discharge in 2015. Applicant made monthly payments \ntotaling approximately $22,700 under the Chapter 13 plan but was unable to continue payments \nwhen her husband\u2019s unemployment benefits ended. At that point, she divorced her husband and \nconverted to a Chapter 7. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.c. refer to the same account with two different creditors, each with an \nunpaid balance of approximately $9,400. Applicant asserted that the account was a medical debt \naccrued by her ex-husband and that she had disputed the accounts with the credit reporting \nagencies. The Judge found, however that \u201cApplicant failed to submit any documentation to support \nher contentions that the account was a medical account, that it was for her ex-spouse, that she \ndisputed it, or that she is not legally responsible for it.\u201d Id. at 4. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. refers to Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns \nfor tax years (TYs) 2015 through 2021. Applicant admitted that she failed to file federal and state \nreturns during the years alleged, but there is inconsistent evidence regarding some of the TYs in \nissues. \nFederal Tax Returns: For TYs 2016 through 2021, Applicant stated in her response to \ninterrogatories that she filed her federal returns in August 2022,1 and IRS transcripts confirm \nreceipt of the same. The federal returns for TYs 2016 through 2021 have been filed, although they \nwere not timely filed. For TY 2015, Applicant stated in her response to interrogatories that she \nalso mailed that return in August 2022, but there is no corroborating evidence as Applicant did not \nsubmit a tax account transcript to confirm that it was filed. \n1 Although the Judge refers repeatedly to Applicant not specifying the year that she filed, it is clear in context from \nher response to interrogatories, as corroborated by tax account transcripts, that she filed in August 2022, as she avers \nin her appeal. Similarly, for TYs 2019\u20132021, the Judge highlights that the date Applicant recorded as e-filing is one \nto two days later than the date that the IRS acknowledges as receiving the filing and that \u201c[t]here was no explanation \nregarding the inconsistency of the filing dates listed by Applicant and the IRS.\u201d Decision at 5, 6. The Board agrees \nwith Applicant that this is a minute discrepancy of no probative value. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nState Tax Returns: Applicant reported in her response to interrogatories that she did not \nfile her state returns until August 2022,2 and she did not submit any tax account transcripts to \ncorroborate her claim that she submitted the returns at that time. Applicant eventually submitted \ndocumentation from the state comptroller indicating seven payments in 2023 totaling \napproximately $4,300, four of which were made under an installment agreement. The Judge found, \nhowever, that \u201c[n]one of the payments or receipts for those payments indicate which tax year they \nare associated with.\u201d Id. at 6. Therefore, there is \u201cno verifying evidence to conclude\u201d that the tax \nreturns for TYs 2015 through 2021 were filed, but instead \u201cmerely evidence that some payments \nhave been made to the state.\u201d Id. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. refers to Applicant\u2019s state income tax delinquency of approximately $18,100, \nwhich Applicant reported in her August 2022 response to interrogatories, noting that the estimated \nbalance did not include any offsets. As of late November 2023, her installment agreement reflected \na balance of approximately $16,700, with monthly payments of approximately $612. \n\u201cInterestingly, in December 2022, she claimed that the unpaid balance had been reduced to zero \nwith a suspected overpayment to be transferred to the IRS. It appears that her contention . . . was \nin error.\u201d Id. at 7. Moreover, the Judge noted, the documents submitted reflect payments to the \nstate commenced in May 2023, six months after the SR was issued. \u201cAfter multiple years of \nnonpayment of her state income tax, Applicant finally started making those payments. . .[and] is \nfinally in the process of resolving her state income tax debt.\u201d Id. \nJudge\u2019s Analysis: The pertinent portions of the Judge\u2019s analysis are quoted and \nsummarized below. \nApplicant has a lengthy history of financial problems. In June 2013, she filed for \nvoluntary bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, estimating \n$72,000 in liabilities. Two years later, she had the bankruptcy converted to a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy and an unspecified amount was reportedly discharged. She \nfailed to timely file her federal and state income tax returns for the multi-year period \nfrom 2015 through 2021. She also incurred a federal income tax debt of $47,806 \nand a state income tax debt of $18,103. In addition, she had three delinquent \ncommercial accounts. It was not until September and October 2022, over a year \nafter she was interviewed by OPM and within a week after the SOR was issued, \nthat the federal and state income tax returns were purportedly filed. [Id. at 9\u201310.] \nThe following disqualifying conditions have been established: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and \n19(f).3 \n2 Again, although the Judge refers to Applicant not \u201cspecifying the year\u201d that she filed, it is clear in context from her \nAugust 31, 2022, response to interrogatories and other evidence of record that she was referring to filing earlier in \nAugust 2022. \n3 AG \u00b6\u00b6 19 (a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; (c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations; and (f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay federal, state, or local income tax as required. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \nThe following mitigating conditions minimally apply: AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(d), and 20(g).4 \nApplicant acknowledged having some financial issues as far back as before June 2013 when she \nfiled for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Despite an unspecified amount of those debts being discharged \nafter her bankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 7 in 2015, she continued to experience financial \ndifficulties. Disgruntled over a federal income tax refund that was erroneously sent to her ex-\nspouse and cashed by him, she \u201clet the situation get out of hand.\u201d Id. at 11. She sued the bank, \nfailed to timely file her federal and state income tax returns for the tax years 2015 through 2021, \nfailed to pay her federal and state tax debt on time, and accrued other delinquent accounts. Id. \nApplicant completed her security clearance application in August 2021, underwent her \ninterview in October 2021, and completed responses to interrogatories in August 2022. \u201cEach step \nof the security clearance review process placed her on notice of the significance of the financial \nissues confronting her.\u201d Id. at 12. The evidence confirms that Applicant filed her federal returns \nthe same week that she responded to the interrogatories, and it remains unclear as to when the state \nincome tax returns were filed. \u201cBy failing to file her federal and state income tax return filings and \nnot making voluntary payments over such a lengthy multi-year period before the government \nshowed interest in her tax issues, Applicant did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information.\u201d Id. \nIn his whole-person analysis, the Judge determined that, although there is \u201csome mitigating \nevidence under the whole-person concept,\u201d the \u201cdisqualifying evidence under the whole-person \nconcept is simply more substantial.\u201d Id. at 14. He noted: \nApplicant has had a lengthy history of financial troubles that commenced before \nJune 2013. That month, she filed for voluntary bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the \nU.S. Bankruptcy Code, estimating $72,000 in liabilities. After her liabilities were \ndischarged under Chapter 7, her financial issues continued, and because of \nproblems related to her 2014 divorce, changes made to joint tax-filings by her ex-\nspouse, and the acceptance by the IRS of such changes related to her personal \ninformation, she failed to timely file her federal and state income tax returns or pay \nher federal and state income tax for the tax years 2015 through 2021. \nApplicant has continued to fail to submit requested verifying \ndocumentation\u2014correspondence, account transcripts, or copies of income tax \nreturns\u2014to support her contentions that she has filed her delinquent state income \ntax returns. And her previously made statement that her remaining state income tax \nbalance was zero as of December 2022 turned out to be false. In fact, Applicant\u2019s \nfirst state income tax payment was made in May 2023 \u2013 six months after the SOR \nwas issued. [Id. at 14.] \n4 AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control and the \nindividual acted responsible under the circumstances; (d) the individual initiated a is adhering to a good -faith effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; (g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \ntax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges several of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact, as well as the \nconclusions that he drew from them. When an Administrative Judge\u2019s factual findings are \nchallenged, the Board must determine whether \u201c[t]he Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact are \nsupported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a \nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d Directive, E3.1.32.1. The \nBoard must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge\u2019s findings, but \nalso whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those \nfindings, and whether the Judge\u2019s findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record \nevidence as a whole. ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 2\u20133 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2005). \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998). \nFirst, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that she has a \u201ca lengthy history of financial \ntroubles that commenced before June 2013.\u201d Decision at 3. We agree that the Judge \nmischaracterized the scope of Applicant\u2019s financial problems at several points in his decision. For \nexample, the Judge summarized the case as follows: \u201cThis case involves three separate issues: the \nfailure to timely file federal and state income tax returns, the failure to pay federal and state income \ntaxes, and lengthy continuing financial problems leading to bankruptcies and still-delinquent \ndebts.\u201d Id. at 11 (emphasis added). Putting aside the tax issues, the allegations and evidence reveal \nfew other financial issues of security concern. The bankruptcy was filed 11 years ago and \ndischarged nine years ago, the liabilities subject to the bankruptcy were relatively limited, and \nApplicant paid over $22,000 under Chapter 13 prior to converting to Chapter 7 in the wake of her \ndivorce. Likewise, although the Judge refers frequently to continued financial delinquencies, the \nallegations and evidence highlight only two: a $30 co-pay that Applicant has belatedly paid and a \ndisputed $9,400 commercial account that was alleged twice.5 The Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant \nhas \u201clengthy continuing financial problems leading to bankruptcies and still-delinquent debts\u201d \nreflects an unreasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole. Id. at 11. We conclude, \nhowever, that this error is harmless, as the Judge\u2019s decision rested overwhelmingly on Applicant\u2019s \n5 Although the Judge acknowledged that the two allegations refer to the same debt, he erroneously entered adverse \nformal findings on both, which is highlighted by Applicant on appeal. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the \nSOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. ISCR Case \nNo. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). Although his formal findings were in error, the Judge explicitly \nrecognized that the two debts were one and the same, and his error was harmless, as it did not likely affect the outcome \nof the case.

See ISCR Case No. 95-0495 at 4. \nTurning to the tax issues, Applicant challenges the following findings by the Judge: that \nshe provided no proof of filing of her federal return for TY 2015; that she provided no state tax \ntranscripts for any of the years in issue (TYs 2015 through 2021), only proof of payments6; that \nshe did not provide a copy of her federal or state installment plan; and that she made a false \nstatement in her December 2022 Answer to the SOR in stating that her state tax balance was zero. \nIn response, Applicant asserts that she had discovered upon filing for TY 2015 in August 2022 \nthat she had in fact filed on time, that she reported the same at her hearing, and that she understood \nthat tax year to be no longer in issue; that she was not asked to provide state tax transcripts for any \ntax years; and that she provided all available state tax information. Additionally, Applicant argues \nthat her December 2022 statement regarding her state tax debt was made in good faith, as her state \ntax authority advised Applicant that they would intercept her federal tax returns for TYs 2018\u2013 \n2022 and apply those funds to her tax debt.7 \nFor TY 2015, we note that Applicant herself reported that she was delinquent in filing her \nTY 2015 federal tax return and paying the taxes due, that TY 2015 was alleged on the SOR, and \nthat Applicant admitted to that allegation. Government Exhibit 2 at 9, 17; Answer to SOR. In a \nDOHA proceeding, it is an applicant\u2019s duty to present evidence in mitigation of the concerns raised \nin her SOR. Directive E3.1.15. The Judge\u2019s determination that Applicant failed to do so is \nsustainable on this record, as she submitted no documents to corroborate her testimony that she \nhad earlier filed her TY 2015 federal return. On the issue of state taxes, although Applicant \nprovided some documents that were responsive to the allegations, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that those \ndocuments were insufficient is sustainable on the record before us. It is neither the Judge\u2019s nor \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s duty to advise an applicant on the evidence needed to mitigate the concerns \nraised in an SOR (i.e., to submit comprehensive tax account transcripts rather than receipts for \nindividual payments). Although pro se applicants are not held to the standards of attorneys, they \nare expected to take reasonable steps to protect their rights. ISCR Case No. 12-02371 at 3 (App. \nBd. Jun. 30, 2014). \nFinally, the Judge\u2019s analysis regarding Applicant\u2019s belated filing and payment of federal \ntaxes is well-grounded in the precedent to which he cites. Although Applicant has filed all federal \nreturns and paid almost all of the federal tax debt, the Judge highlighted that Applicant did not take \naction on filing her returns or paying delinquent taxes until \u201cthe government showed interest in \nher tax issues.\u201d Decision at 12. The Appeal Board has held that the mere filing of delinquent tax \nreturns or paying delinquent tax debt does not compel a judge to issue a favorable decision and \nthat the timing of corrective action is an appropriate factor for a judge to consider in the application \nof AG \u00b6 20(g). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01807 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018). \n6 As Applicant notes, the Judge erred in his finding that \u201c[n]one of the payments or receipts for those payments indicate \nwhich tax year they are associated with.\u201d Id. at 6. The receipts for three of the payments indicate that they were made \ntowards delinquencies for TY 2015, TY 2016, and TY 2017. Applicant Exhibits M, N, and O. This error is harmless, \nas it did not likely affect the outcome of the case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 95-0495 at 4. \n7 Ultimately, the state was only able to intercept three of the five refunds, and a state tax delinquency remained. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn conclusion, Applicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error.

On \nAugust 24, 2022, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline D \n(Sexual Behavior) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) \nand DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On June 20, 2024, Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Philip J. Katauskas granted Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility. The Government appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and \nE3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline B and Guideline E, the SOR alleged that, for various years-long periods \nbetween 2010 and at least January 2020, Applicant provided financial support to four resident \ncitizens of the Philippines and one resident citizen of the United Kingdom. The SOR further \nalleged under Guideline D that Applicant had sexual relations with one of the Philippine resident \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncitizens in 2007 and that, as of the SOR, his spouse was unaware of any of the foregoing \ninformation. Applicant admitted all of the allegations with explanation. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant, in his mid-60s, has been married since 1991 and has two adult children. After \nserving for 20 years on active duty, he retired from the United States military in 2004, since which \ntime he has worked for various defense contractors. He completed a security clearance application \n(\u201cSCA\u201d) in 2019, wherein he disclosed the relationships and information alleged in the SOR. \nIn 2007, while working overseas for a defense contractor, Applicant met a Philippine \ncitizen, \u201cAlpha,\u201d in a club where she was working and the two had a brief physical relationship. \nApplicant testified that he and Alpha subsequently stayed friends and that she later returned to the \nPhilippines. In about 2009, Applicant began sending Alpha monthly financial support, which \nincreased several times, and he estimated that he had provided her approximately $40,000 as of \nhis 2019 SCA. His support of Alpha continued until 2021 or 2022. Applicant\u2019s wife is not aware \nof his infidelity and was not aware of his financial support until about a year prior to the hearing. \nIn 2010, Applicant met another Philippine resident citizen, \u201cBravo,\u201d in an online game, \nand he later met her once or twice in person in the Philippines. He began sending her financial \nsupport in June 2011 and estimated having sent her approximately $11,000 as of his SCA. His \nsupport of Bravo continued until about 2022. Applicant met another Philippine resident citizen, \n\u201cCharlie,\u201d through the same online game in 2014, although he never met her in person. He began \nsending her financial support that same year and estimated having sent her approximately $8,500 \nas of his SCA. His support of Charlie continued until January 2020. \nApplicant met another Philippine resident citizen, \u201cDelta,\u201d during a trip to the Philippines \nfor a computer course in 2013. In 2014, he began sending her financial support, which continued \nfor about 36 months and was estimated to total approximately $4,000. Finally, in 2010, Applicant \nmet a resident citizen of the United Kingdom, \u201cEcho,\u201d on a website \u201cwhere one could pay for \nvirtual sex,\u201d although they did not do that. Decision at 6. They never met in person but remained \nfriends. Between 2012 and 2013, Applicant provided Echo approximately $3,400 in financial \nsupport. \nRegarding his own finances, Applicant\u2019s mortgage was past due for approximately $61,000 \nas of his January 2023 credit report. He explained that he was in forbearance for almost two years \ndue to COVID and that he was unemployed for six months and was unable to make payments. The \nhouse was scheduled to go into foreclosure, but he began making monthly payments and his \nJanuary 2024 credit report reflects that the mortgage account is current. \nThe Judge took administrative notice of facts regarding the Philippines including, among \nothers, that the \u201cU.S. Department of State travel advisory for the Philippines is Level 2: Exercise \nIncreased Caution due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and kidnapping\u201d and \u201chas also catalogued \nand taken notice of human rights issues in the Philippines.\u201d Decision at 7. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nDiscussion \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After \nthe Government produces evidence raising security concerns, an applicant bears the burden of \npersuasion concerning mitigation. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security \nclearance decisions is that a clearance may be granted only when \u201cclearly consistent with the \ninterests of the national security.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved \nin favor of the national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \nOn appeal, the Government argues that the Judge\u2019s applications of the Guideline B, \nGuideline D, and Guideline E mitigating conditions and his analysis under the Whole-Person \nConcept were arbitrary, capricious, and not supported by the record evidence. A judge\u2019s decision \ncan be found to be arbitrary or capricious if it \u201cfails to examine relevant evidence, fails to articulate \na rational connection between the facts found and the choice made, fails to be based on a \nconsideration of relevant factors, involves a clear error of judgment, fails to consider an important \naspect of the case, or is so implausible as to indicate more than a mere difference of opinion.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 94-0215, 1995 WL 396942 at *3 (App. Bd. Apr. 13, 1995) (citing Motor Vehicle \nMfr. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). For the reasons stated below, we \nreverse the Judge\u2019s decision. \nGuideline D \nUnder Guideline D, the Government\u2019s challenge on appeal is limited to the Judge\u2019s \nfavorable finding regarding Applicant\u2019s extramarital sexual relationship with Alpha in 2007 and \nhis wife\u2019s ongoing ignorance of the matter. \nRegarding the sexual relationship itself, the Judge found that the conduct triggered \ndisqualification under AG \u00b6 13(c) but was ultimately mitigated through AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(c)1 \nbecause it happened 17 years ago and only twice, Applicant has \u201cceased communications with and \nany financial assistance to Alpha,\u201d and therefore \u201c[a]ny basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress \nis speculative and has long since evaporated.\u201d Decision at 11. The Government argues that the \nJudge improperly focused on the age of the infidelity itself and thereby ignored \u201crelevant facts \nshowing Applicant\u2019s ongoing vulnerability to coercion or exploitation.\u201d Appeal Brief at 19-20. \nWe agree. \nWhile the passage of time since an applicant last engaged in conduct is a relevant factor \nthat should be considered, even dated conduct can be the source of an applicant\u2019s current \nvulnerability to coercion or influence. See ISCR Case No. 02-32254, 2004 WL 1434432 at *3 \n(App. Bd. May 26, 2004). In his mitigation analysis, the Judge overstates the significance of the \npassage of time since Applicant\u2019s extramarital relationship and fails entirely to address Applicant\u2019s \nstrong desire and efforts to hide the information from everyone, including and especially his \n1 AG \u00b6 14(b) \u2013 The sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances, that \nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; AG \n\u00b6 14(c) \u2013 The behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nfamily.2 Indeed, Applicant acknowledged that no one, including his wife and children, knows \nabout his infidelity and that he has actively worked to keep it, as well as the rest of his alleged \nrelationships with foreign nationals, secret. See, e.g., Government Exhibit (GE) 2 at 11. The \nJudge\u2019s omission of these relevant and important facts ignores the vulnerability created by \nApplicant\u2019s ongoing secrecy and erodes the Judge\u2019s resulting mitigation analysis. \nWhen the Board finds that a judge\u2019s decision is unsustainable, we must determine if the \nappropriate remedy is remand or reversal. The former is appropriate when the legal errors can be \ncorrected through remand and there is a significant chance of reaching a different result upon \ncorrection, such as when a judge fails to consider relevant and material evidence. If the identified \nerrors cannot be remedied on remand, the decision must be reversed. See ISCR Case No. 03-09053, \n2006 WL 2524484 at *5 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2006). Such is the case when, after addressing the \nidentified error, the Board concludes that a contrary formal finding or overall grant or denial of \nsecurity clearance eligibility is the clear outcome based on the record. \nOverall, the Judge\u2019s mitigation through application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and (c) was \nunsupported by the record and Appeal Board precedent, and the resulting favorable Guideline D \ndecision is unsustainable and reversed. \nGuideline E \nThe Judge also found favorably for Applicant on the concerns cross-alleged under \nGuideline E, citing only \u201cthe reasons set forth under the Guideline B discussion.\u201d Decision at 12. \nSuch an analysis \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 fails for multiple reasons. First and more generally, the \nGuidelines exist as separate entities and represent distinct concerns regarding the conduct of \nsecurity clearance applicants. As such, a judge must consider and evaluate an applicant\u2019s conduct \nunder any and all Guidelines under which the conduct has been alleged in the SOR. See ISCR Case \nNo. 01-03107, 2002 WL 32114507 at *4 (App. Bd. Aug. 27, 2002). Second and specifically with \nrespect to Guideline E, it is well-settled that an applicant\u2019s conduct may demonstrate questionable \njudgment or unreliability under Guideline E even where it is insufficient for an unfavorable \ndetermination under other Guidelines. See id. at *3; ISCR Case No. 06-21537, 2008 WL 681971 \nat *4 (App. Bd. Feb. 21, 2008). The Judge\u2019s cursory dismissal of the Guideline E concerns based \nwholly on his conclusions under Guideline B was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. \nThe Guideline E case presents overlapping facts and mirrored analyses with the Guideline \nD case \u2013 i.e., whether an applicant\u2019s conduct, or concealment thereof, creates a vulnerability to \nexploitation or duress \u2013 which we address substantively in our Guideline D discussion and through \nwhich lens we can ascertain the merits of the Guideline E concern.3 \n2 Curiously, the Judge also found that Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \u201cunawareness of [the] conduct is not \u2018sexual behavior\u2019 that \nis a disqualifying condition under Guideline D\u201d and is otherwise also mitigated through AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(c). \nDecision at 11-12. The Judge\u2019s focus in this regard is misplaced, as the wife\u2019s ongoing ignorance of the infidelity is \nnot part of the sexual behavior, but rather is what creates his vulnerability to coercion or influence. \n3 Compare AG \u00b6 16(e) (\u201cPersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group\u201d \nincluding, but not limited to \u201cengaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nDuring his December 2019 security clearance interview, Applicant acknowledged that, \ndespite his loyalty to the U.S., \u201che may be susceptible to blackmail, because he does not want his \nwife to find out about these women, since it would likely result in marital strife and possible \ndivorce.\u201d GE 2 at 11. He then asserted in an undated response to the August 2022 SOR that, \nI have never told my wife or anyone else of what I was doing \nconcerning the support of these women. As such, no one is aware of \nthese relationships. My wife would not understand the friendships \nor financial support I provided. . . . I did not want my wife to find \nout about these women, since it would likely result in marital strife \nand possible divorce as she would not understand the reasoning with \nwhat I was trying to do, to better the lives of individuals who were \nless fortunate than I. . . . My wife did actually find out about one of \n[them] as I had accidently left a skype message open. She of course \nwent through the roof and we agreed upon to have my checking \naccount monitored to ensure this didn\u2019t happen again. \nSOR Response at 6. Applicant\u2019s strong and lasting desire to maintain the secrecy of his five \nrelationships for fear of possible negative consequences is precisely the kind of concealment \ncontemplated for disqualification under AG \u00b6 16(e). The Board has held that there is a rational \nconnection between conduct that an applicant \u201cdoes not want his wife to discover and a concern \nthat he could be pressured to disclose classified information should this conduct come to the \nattention of those interested in acquiring U.S. protected information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02407, \n2017 WL 5560617 at *1 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2017). To the extent that the Judge failed to apply \ndisqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(e), such failure was in error. \nTurning to the possibility of mitigation, the only relevant condition necessarily fails. AG \u00b6 \n17(e) affords mitigation when the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. At hearing, Applicant explained that his \nfamily was now aware generally that he had provided the financial support, but that his wife was \nunaware of the total amount provided. Tr. at 13, 70; Decision at 10. Beyond the financial nature \nof the relationships, there is no evidence that Applicant had disclosed the extent of the personal \nnature of his relationships with Bravo, Charlie, Delta, or Echo, such as the duration or frequency \nof contact, and the extent of his relationship with Alpha remained secret.4 \nViewed in totality, the record establishes that Applicant\u2019s concealment of his relationships \nwith all five women exposes him to an unmitigated vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress. The Judge\u2019s favorable finding under Guideline E is therefore unsustainable and reversed.5 \nor community standing.\u201d), with AG \u00b6 13(c) (\u201cSexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress.\u201d). \n4 In his reply to the Government\u2019s appeal, Applicant asserts that his \u201cwife has known about parts of all this for many \nyears, but now everything has been disclosed.\u201d Reply Brief at 3. This revelation amounts to new evidence, which the \nAppeal Board is prohibited from considering on appeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \n5 In addition to the vulnerability created by Applicant\u2019s concealment of his relationships, his underlying conduct \u2013 \ni.e., the relationships themselves \u2013 arguably raise concerns under AG \u00b6 16(d). So too does his engaging in and \nconcealing those relationships while holding a security clearance. See ISCR Case No. 91-0259 at 6 (App. Bd.

Decision at 10. He concluded, however, that the disqualifying conditions were \nnot fully applicable because there was no evidence that the individuals were associated with a \nforeign military, government, or intelligence service, nor was there evidence that Applicant\u2019s \nrelationships created a heightened risk of foreign exploitation or a potential conflict of interest. \nThe Judge went on to conclude that any concern created by Applicant\u2019s relationships was mitigated \nthrough application of AG \u00b6 8(a)6 because the nature of the foreign relationships made it unlikely \nthat Applicant would be placed in a position of having to choose between those relationships and \nthe interests of the U.S. \nOn appeal, the Government argues that the Judge \u201cfailed to consider the true nature and \nextent of Applicant\u2019s contacts and relationships with the foreign women,\u201d and challenges his \nfailure to fully apply AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). Appeal Brief at 16. This argument is of mixed merit. \nAG \u00b6 7(a) affords disqualification based on an applicant\u2019s contact with a foreign citizen or \nresident \u201cif that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d7 The record is clear that Applicant had connections to and \nmaintained long-term, regular contact with all of the individuals alleged in the SOR. The \nGovernment\u2019s argument that the contacts create a heightened risk, however, is unpersuasive. While \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d is not a high standard to meet, there is insufficient evidence that any of \nApplicant\u2019s contacts poses something greater than the normal risk inherent in having a contact \nliving under a foreign government. See ISCR Case No. 17-03026, 2019 WL 995681 at *3 (App. \nBd. Jan. 16, 2019) (citation omitted). Based on the foregoing, we find no error in the Judge \ndeclining to find that Applicant\u2019s foreign relationships create a heightened risk. \nThe reasonableness of the Judge\u2019s failure to apply disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 7(b) poses \na more complicated question. While AG \u00b6 7(a) requires a judge to examine the nature and extent \nof the relevant contacts in terms of a heightened risk, AG \u00b6 7(b) requires consideration of the nature \nof the relationships at stake. ISCR Case No. 08-11788, 2010 WL 3200754 at *2 (App. Bd. Jul. 28, \n1992) (A clearance holder has \u201can obligation, at a minimum, to refrain from engaging in a conduct which places him \nat risk of being subject to coercion or influence.\u201d). Although we see no likely avenue of mitigation for either concern \nin this record, our finding that the Judge\u2019s Guideline E decision should be reversed on other grounds makes further \nreview of these matters unnecessary. \n6 AG \u00b6 8(a) \u2013 The nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or \nthe positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the U.S. \n7 AG \u00b6 7(a) \u2013 Contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, \nor other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n2010).8 The Government argues that \u201cthe Judge altogether ignored the vast evidence\u2014including \nthe duration, frequency, and nature of Applicant\u2019s communications with these women and his \nsignificant financial support of them over years\u2014demonstrating Applicant\u2019s strong feelings of \naffection and obligation towards these five foreign women.\u201d Appeal Brief at 17. \nLeaning exclusively on Applicant\u2019s testimony that he had since ceased communicating \nwith and providing financial support to the women, the Judge dismissed the applicability of AG \u00b6 \n7(b) and found simply, \nThere is no evidence that [Applicant\u2019s] financial support to his \nforeign friends created . . . a conflict of interest between his \nobligation to protect classified information and his desire to help one \nor more of his friends. In addition, in light of the nature of his \nrelationships with these foreign friends, it is unlikely that he will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the United States. \nDecision at 10. In rendering his conclusion, the Judge ignored significant record evidence \nregarding the full nature of Applicant\u2019s relationships including, as the Government points out, his \nown acknowledgment that he put the women\u2019s interests before his own family\u2019s many times. \nAppeal Brief at 17 (citing Tr. at 51). The Judge\u2019s summary analysis is too slight and also too \ngeneralized, as it should likely differ from one relationship to the next. We would be inclined to \nremand the case back to the Judge to provide a more comprehensive analysis of Applicant\u2019s \nrelationships under AG \u00b6 7(b), but such action is ultimately unnecessary due to the analyses under \nGuidelines E and D that warrant reversal. \nThe Government has met its burden on appeal of demonstrating reversible error below. \nConsidering the record as a whole, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s findings under Guidelines E and \nD are arbitrary and capricious as they fail to consider important aspects of the case, fail to articulate \na satisfactory explanation for material conclusions, and run contrary to the weight of the record \nevidence. Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s overall favorable decision is not sustainable under \nthe Egan standard. \n8 AG \u00b6 7(b) \u2013 Connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information or technology. \nSee also ISCR Case No. 18-00753, 2019 WL 3308144 at *4 (App. Bd.

    "summary": "Analysis Applicant is in his early 50s. He has one adult child from his former marriage and a minor child with his cohabitant. Applicant served in the military from 1990 until his honorable discharge in 2014, during which time he held a security clearance. In 2010, his clearance was favorably adjudicated with a caution to address his delinquent debts. Applicant has worked for a defense contractor since December 2016. His current monthly income from all sources is approximately $8,700 and he has a net remainder of about $3,900 each month after all other expenses are paid, which he provides to his cohabitant. Applicant explained that he was working with his creditors and a debt repair company to address nine of the 12 delinquent accounts, and that he was found liable for the mortgage account pursuant to his divorce. Additionally, having given his former wife power of attorney while he was deployed in the military, he asserted that he was unaware of most of the SOR debts until he applied for a loan and learned about his low credit score. Applicant\u2019s documentation reflected that he paid the credit repair company four $109 payments from April to July 2022; however, he learned that the company would not resolve his debts in the way he expected and he stopped working with them after July 2022. In 2021 and twice again after receiving his SOR in June or July 2022, Applicant contacted nine of his creditors (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, 1.i-1.k) to request settlements, but only one of them ultimatel",

On \nNovember 6, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Philip J. \nKatauskas granted Applicant security clearance eligibility. The Government appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged 13 financial concerns, including delinquent debt totaling approximately \n$29,000 and that Applicant\u2019s property was foreclosed upon in about 2019 due to his inability to \npay his monthly mortgage payment. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the \nallegations with limited explanation. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s Findings and Analysis \nApplicant is in his early 50s. He has one adult child from his former marriage and a \nminor child with his cohabitant. Applicant served in the military from 1990 until his honorable \ndischarge in 2014, during which time he held a security clearance. In 2010, his clearance was \nfavorably adjudicated with a caution to address his delinquent debts. Applicant has worked for a \ndefense contractor since December 2016. His current monthly income from all sources is \napproximately $8,700 and he has a net remainder of about $3,900 each month after all other \nexpenses are paid, which he provides to his cohabitant. \nApplicant explained that he was working with his creditors and a debt repair company to \naddress nine of the 12 delinquent accounts, and that he was found liable for the mortgage \naccount pursuant to his divorce. Additionally, having given his former wife power of attorney \nwhile he was deployed in the military, he asserted that he was unaware of most of the SOR debts \nuntil he applied for a loan and learned about his low credit score. Applicant\u2019s documentation \nreflected that he paid the credit repair company four $109 payments from April to July 2022; \nhowever, he learned that the company would not resolve his debts in the way he expected and he \nstopped working with them after July 2022. \nIn 2021 and twice again after receiving his SOR in June or July 2022, Applicant \ncontacted nine of his creditors (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, 1.i-1.k) to request settlements, but only one of \nthem ultimately made a settlement offer and the other eight required lump sum payments. He \nplans to pay off each account when he has the money to pay each in full. Applicant also reached \na payment plan with another creditor (SOR \u00b6 1.h) but had not yet received the written agreement. \nAdditionally, despite testifying that a medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.l) had been resolved, Applicant \nproduced no documentation to support that claim. The Judge found that the foregoing 11 debts \nwere unresolved. \nApplicant contacted another creditor (SOR \u00b6 1.g) days before his security clearance \nhearing and established a plan under which he would pay approximately $120 per month for 12 \nmonths beginning August 2023 \u2013 the month after the hearing \u2013 to satisfy the full balance. The \nJudge found that this debt was being resolved. The Judge also found that Applicant\u2019s foreclosure \n(SOR \u00b6 1.m) was resolved by virtue of his testimony that the home sold for more than was owed \non the loan, which was corroborated by documentation. \nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s debts were \u201c\u2018largely\u2019 \u2013 if not wholly \u2013 beyond his \ncontrol\u201d and that he \u201cacted responsibly in confronting his financial situation,\u201d and thereby \nconcluded that mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) applied to Applicant\u2019s financial \nconcerns.

For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the Judge\u2019s decision. \nA Judge\u2019s decision can be found to be arbitrary or capricious if \u201cit does not examine \nrelevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a \nrational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant \nfactors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it \noffers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so \nimplausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.\u201d ISCR Case No. 97-0184 \nat 5, n.3 (App. Bd. Jun. 16, 1998) (citing Motor Vehicle Mfr. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., \n463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). \nThe Government first challenges the Judge\u2019s application of AG \u00b6 20(d) and contends that \n\u201cthere is insufficient evidence to find that Applicant has taken significant steps to effectuate a \n\u2018reasonable plan\u2019 to resolve his debts.\u201d Appeal Brief at 8. AG \u00b6 20(d) affords mitigation when \n\u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.\u201d The Board has held that a \u201cgood-faith effort to repay\u201d requires that the \napplicant demonstrate a \u201cmeaningful financial track record,\u201d which \u201cnecessarily includes \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). \nIn concluding that AG \u00b6 20(d) applied in this case, the Judge appears to have relied \nentirely on Applicant\u2019s four payments to the credit repair company, which he discontinued a year \nprior to his security clearance hearing, and Applicant\u2019s plan to resolve SOR \u00b6 1.g, which was \nestablished only days before his hearing, would not actually begin until the month after the \nhearing, and would satisfy about $1,500 of the SOR\u2019s $29,000 in delinquent debt. Applicant\u2019s \nshort-lived efforts to repair his credit and his promise to take future action on a single debt do not \namount to a meaningful track record or to actual debt reduction sufficient to invoke AG \u00b6 20(d), \nand the Judge\u2019s application of the condition is unsustainable. \nThe Government also challenges the Judge\u2019s application of AG \u00b6 20(b), which affords \nmitigation upon finding that the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control and that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. The Judge \nfound that \u201cApplicant\u2019s indebtedness was incurred by his then wife, while he was in the \n[military] on deployment,\u201d and that he acted responsibly when he contacted some of his creditors \nto request settlements, albeit unsuccessfully, and temporarily retained a credit repair company. \nDecision at 6, 7. The Government argues that this finding failed to consider important record \nevidence, including that Applicant was assigned responsibility for many of the delinquencies in \nhis February 2018 divorce and that he continued to incur new delinquencies, including five debts \nalleged in the SOR, after the divorce was finalized. Additionally, Applicant discussed the debts \nultimately alleged in his SOR during his October 2021 clearance interview, at which time he \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nexpressed his plan \u201cto pay off each account when he has the money to pay the account in full.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 9. Despite this asserted plan, however, Applicant declined to use his monthly net \nremainder of approximately $3,900 \u2013 which sum is greater than the amounts owed on ten of the \nSOR debts \u2013 to make any lump sum payments, and also failed to establish any repayment plan \nuntil the week of his July 2023 hearing. Considering the foregoing, we conclude that the record \nin this case does not support application of AG \u00b6 20(b). \nThe standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that a clearance may be granted \nonly when \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). From \nour review of the record, there was insufficient evidence for the Judge to conclude that \u201cno \nquestions [exist] about [Applicant\u2019s] eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.\u201d Decision \nat 8. The Judge\u2019s decision runs contrary to the weight of the record evidence, and was therefore \narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. The record, viewed as a whole, is not sufficient to \nmitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under Egan. Therefore, the decision is not \nsustainable. \nOrder \nThe decision is REVERSED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Gregg A.

He and his family were at a courtroom proceeding for an individual who had killed \nApplicant\u2019s father in a drunk driving incident. In the courtroom, an altercation broke out between \nApplicant\u2019s family and the defendant\u2019s family. Members of both families were charged with disorderly \nconduct, but the charges were subsequently dismissed. \nIn April 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with aggravated assault (SOR \u00b6 1.g), \nfollowing a report by his sister that Applicant and his brother had assaulted her. Applicant testified \nthat this sister suffers from bipolar disorder and that she made a false report following a family dispute. \nThe charges against Applicant and his brother were eventually nolle prossed. \nIn June 2007, Applicant was arrested for soliciting prostitution. At hearing, he testified to \nthe following details: he met up with an old friend; he did not know that she was a prostitute; they \nspoke in his car for about 30 minutes; the police pulled up behind them and first questioned his \nfriend separately; he was then arrested and charged; and the charges were later dismissed. \nIn October 2010, Applicant was arrested for DUI (SOR \u00b6 1.e). He testified he was coming \nout of a pharmacy, that there was a \u201ccommotion . . . going on,\u201d and that he was stopped and charged \nwith DUI prior to entering his vehicle. Decision at 4, quoting Tr. at 52. Applicant testified that he \nbelieved he was arrested due to racial profiling and that he was not offered a field sobriety test.

Applicant testified that he was unaware that his driver\u2019s license had been suspended following \nthe October 2010 arrest and that he needed to pay a fee to have it reinstated. Applicant was \nsentenced to perform community service, and the charge was subsequently dismissed. \nIn February 2020, Applicant was arrested and charged with domestic battery/physical \ncontact (SOR \u00b6 1.c.), which led to a protective order and a subsequent August 2020 arrest for the \nviolation of that protective order (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant testified that these charges arose from a \nfamily dispute with his then-fianc\u00e9e and that she made false allegations against him. In April 2021, \nthe judge found Applicant not guilty of the two charges. \nIn November 2021, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI\u20132nd offense, improper \ntraffic lane usage, and operating an uninsured motor vehicle (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The police report \ncontained the following details: Applicant reported that he was on his way home from his sister\u2019s \nbirthday party; he initially denied any alcohol consumption; he later admitted to the police officer \nthat he had consumed one alcoholic beverage; his breathalyzer test revealed a blood alcohol \ncontent (BAC) of 0.245%; and he appeared to have urinated in his pants. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s \ncar appeared to have been involved in an accident as there was significant damage to the front of \nthe car, the front passenger tire was blown, and Applicant had been driving on the rim. At the \npolice station following his arrest, Applicant refused to provide another breath sample or to answer \npolice questions, and he was taken home after completing the booking process. \nIn December 2022, Applicant pled guilty to the reduced charge of reckless driving on the \nadvice of counsel. Applicant was \u201crequired to enroll in an alcohol program, use an alcohol-testing \ndevice for one year, attend a victims-impact panel, and pay fines of $2,502,\u201d although his use of \nthe testing device was later reduced to six months after he successfully passed all alcohol-breath \ntests. Decision at 6. Placed on probation for two years, Applicant remained on probation at the time \nof the hearing in September 2023. \nAt hearing, Applicant testified that he had not consumed any alcohol the night of his arrest \nor at any time since his father was killed by a drunk driver in 1996. Applicant testified that he had \nbeen to the dentist to have a tooth removed three days prior to the incident, that he had not felt \nwell afterwards, and that he was not eating or taking his Type II diabetes medication. Around 4:00 \nAM on Sunday, Applicant decided to drive himself to the hospital and was pulled over by the \npolice for driving under 20 mph in a 45 mph zone. Under direct examination, Applicant admitted \nthat he was confused when pulled over and introduced the possible explanation of hyperglycemia, \nwhich he explained to be a condition that occurs when one\u2019s blood sugar is not properly controlled \nwith medication. The symptoms include confusion and loss of motor skills. Applicant testified that \nhe had not previously experienced symptoms of hyperglycemia because he had always taken his \ndiabetic medication as prescribed until he experienced severe pain after his dental appointment. \nBecause he had not consumed any alcohol, Applicant proffered that a condition known as diabetic \nketoacidosis might have caused a false positive on the breathalyzer test, and he submitted medical \nstudies explaining the condition. Applicant testified that he told the police officer that he was not \nfeeling well and that he needed medical treatment, but the police report does not reflect that \nApplicant made those statements. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that\u2014after the police dropped him off at his home\u2014he called 911 to go \nto the hospital, where \u201che did not specifically request any alcohol test or toxicology tests.\u201d Id. \nInstead, the hospital records reflect that Applicant apparently complained of abdominal pain \nfollowing a motor vehicle accident and that he was given a CT scan, which revealed no acute \nabnormality in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis. His panel of lab results included a blood sugar \nreading of 126. The medical studies and reports submitted by Applicant noted that \u201cHyperglycemia \nusually doesn\u2019t cause symptoms until blood sugar (glucose) levels are high \u2013 above 180 to 200 \nmilligrams.\u201d Id. at 6, quoting Applicant Exhibit (AE) P. The Judge concluded that \u201c[t]here is no \ndocumentary evidence that Applicant experienced, tested, or was treated for high blood sugar \nlevels, hyperglycemia, or diabetic ketoacidosis.\u201d Id. at 6. \nBased on this information it does not appear, nor is there any evidence to support, \nthat Applicant was suffering from hyperglycemia at the time of his second [DUI] \narrest. Applicant\u2019s symptoms are consistent with a highly intoxicated individual \nwhose BAC was measured at 0.245%. . . . Because the record evidence did not \nestablish Applicant suffered from hyperglycemia, Applicant similarly did not \nestablish that he suffered from diabetic ketoacidosis. [Id. at 7 (internal citations \nomitted).] \nSentenced to enroll in an intensive outpatient program (IOP), Applicant successfully \ncompleted the program in January 2022. The counselor\u2019s one-page IOP summary stated that \nApplicant \u201chas been encouraged to regularly engage in community support group meetings (e.g., \n12-step groups), get a sponsor; engage regularly in mental health treatment and continue to actively \napply what had been learned in group.\u201d Id., quoting AE J, Z. Although the IOP summary does not \nprovide a diagnosis or prognosis, \u201cit appears that Applicant was treated for some type of substance \nmisuse.\u201d Id. at 7. Applicant provided no treatment records other than the one-page summary. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nApplicant\u2019s multiple arrests between 1990 and 2021 and his current probation status \nestablish security concerns under Guideline J. These concerns are not mitigated because \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cpattern of criminal conduct spans over three decades,\u201d he remains on probation until \nDecember 2024, and \u201c[i]nsufficient time has passed to demonstrate that Applicant\u2019s criminal \nconduct will not recur.\u201d Id. at 10. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe record evidence establishes security concerns under Guideline G, as Applicant \u201cwas \ninvolved in two alcohol-related arrests in 2010 and 2021, and his November 2021 BAC recording \nwas extremely high at .245%.\u201d Id. \nApplicant denied that he has consumed any alcohol since his father was killed by a \ndrunk driver in 1996. . . .

His \nblood alcohol content registered extremely high at .245%, well above the legal limit. \nThere is no mention in the police report of any request for immediate medical \ntreatment. Applicant reiterated that immediately following his arrest he went to the \nhospital to get his high blood sugar levels under control. The post-hearing \nsubmission of the hospital records does not support his testimony. The records \nclearly indicate that he received a CT scan on his chest, abdomen, and pelvis \nfollowing a motor vehicle accident. There was nothing in the hospital record that \nindicated Applicant complained of symptoms consistent with high blood sugar \nlevels, hyperglycemia, or diabetic ketoacidosis, provided test results establishing \nthese conditions, or has ever been treated for these conditions. Given the pattern of \ndiscrepancies between the documentary evidence and Applicant\u2019s claims, I did not \nfind his testimony credible. . . . Based on him being an unreliable witness, there is \ninsufficient evidence to establish mitigation under any of the [mitigating] \nconditions. [Id. at 11.] \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct, two alcohol-related arrests, \nand probation status until December 2024 raise security concerns under Guideline E and that none \nof the mitigating conditions apply: \nApplicant is not a credible witness. His failure to accept responsibility for his \nmisconduct and his misrepresentation of relevant facts indicate that he may be \npersonally or professionally vulnerable if his criminal and alcohol-related \nmisconduct were known to the community. Overall, he has shown little remorse or \nrehabilitation following his pattern of rule violations, and his behavior continues to \ncast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. [Id. at 12.] \nWhole-Person Concept \nApplicant was arrested on at least 11 occasions over three decades. He is currently \non probation until December 2024. He has not been candid about the circumstances \nof his criminal and alcohol-related offenses. I find that more time is required \nwithout repeat offenses before Applicant can be considered successfully \nrehabilitated. [Id. at 13.] \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant raises the following issues: whether the Judge failed to consider all \nthe mitigating evidence submitted by Applicant, particularly evidence that many of Applicant\u2019s \narrests had resulted in either dismissals or acquittals; whether she erred in her credibility \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nassessment; and whether she committed harmful error in applying facts that were not supported by \nthe record, rendering her decision arbitrary and capricious. 1 \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary and capricious, we will \nreview the Judge\u2019s decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails \nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error \nof judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998).  \nApplicant\u2019s arguments are of mixed merit. We turn first to his argument that\u2014in her \nGuideline J analysis\u2014the Judge neglected to consider or address evidence of dismissals and \nacquittals. Applicant highlights that, although the SOR alleges eleven incidents of criminal \nconduct, only two incidents resulted in convictions\u2014one for disorderly conduct in 1990 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.k.) and one for reckless driving in 2021 following an arrest for DUI (SOR \u00b6 1.a.). He notes that \nApplicant provided court documents confirming findings of \u201cNot Guilty\u201d to two offenses\u2014the \n2010 DUI (SOR \u00b6 1.e.) and the 2020 domestic battery (SOR \u00b6 1.c.); that Applicant testified that \nother incidents were dismissed (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., and 1.i.); and that the Government \nfailed to submit evidence of the underlying facts for any of the offenses of which Applicant was \nnot convicted. \nNonetheless, the Administrative Judge ruled entirely against [Applicant], even for \nallegations that resulted in a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict. The Administrative Judge \nprovided no explanation why any of the allegations outside of 1.a. were unfavorable \nfor [Applicant]. The Administrative Judge\u2019s analysis under Guideline J did not \nprovide a rational finding related to the evidence. A finding without explanation or \nevidence is clearly arbitrary and capricious. [AB at 17 (emphasis in original).] \nThis argument has merit. The Judge erred in that she failed to articulate a satisfactory \nexplanation for her summary conclusion that \u201cApplicant\u2019s pattern of criminal conduct spans over \nthree decades and raises serious security concerns.\u201d Decision at 10. The record confirms a 1992 \nconviction for an ammunition violation and a 2022 plea to reckless driving following a 2021 DUI \narrest. Those two offenses may bookend a span of thirty years, but the Judge fails to explain how \nthey constitute a \u201cpattern\u201d given the equivocal evidence about the nine incidents in the middle. Of \nthose nine incidents, the record confirms a nolle prosequi of an alleged 2004 assault, an acquittal \nof a 2010 DUI charge, and an acquittal of a 2020 domestic battery charge. For the remaining six \noffenses, three of which date back to the 1990s, the Government submitted no evidence on the \nunderlying conduct, and Applicant testified to favorable resolutions for all six (i.e., either \ndismissals or expungement). It is possible that the underlying criminal conduct gives rise to \nsecurity concerns despite the acquittals and dismissals. The Judge, however, neglected to articulate \n1 At one point in a lengthy brief, Applicant\u2019s counsel also alleges that the Judge \u201cintroduced the issue of bias through \nher questions to [Applicant],\u201d AB at 10, but fails to expand on that allegation at any point in his brief. The Directive \nrequires that an \u201cappeal brief must state the specific issue or issues being raised, and cite specific portions of the case \nrecord supporting any alleged error.\u201d \u00b6 E3.1.30. In light of counsel\u2019s failure to comply with this fundamental \nrequirement, we conclude that the issue of bias has not been raised and decline to address it. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhow that might be the case here and instead\u2014without explanation\u2014simply made sweeping \nadverse findings on all eleven allegations. That is error. \nHaving determined error, we turn next to whether it is harmful and necessitates remand. In \nthe context of this case, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s error is harmless as it does not appear likely \nthat she would have reached a different result in this case even had she articulated her reasoning \ngiven the evidence of acquittals and dismissals of much of the alleged criminal conduct. See ISCR \nCase No. 95-0495 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 22, 1996) (an error is harmless if it is not outcome \ndeterminative), citing NLRB v. American Geri-Care, 697 F.2d 56, 64 (2nd Cir. 1982) (remand \nrequired only where there is a significant chance that, but for the error, a different result might \nhave been reached), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 906 (1983)). That is because the gravamen of this \ncase\u2014and of the Judge\u2019s decision\u2014 is the 2021 DUI arrest, Applicant\u2019s explanation of that \nincident, and the Judge\u2019s determination that he was not testifying credibly about that incident, as \ndiscussed below. \nIn finding that Applicant\u2019s testimony regarding the November 2021 incident was not \ncredible, the Judge highlighted the \u201cpattern of discrepancies between the documentary evidence \nand Applicant\u2019s claims.\u201d Decision at 11. On appeal, Applicant improbably argues that there were \nno discrepancies but instead simply different explanations for a chain of events, and that the Judge \nerred in \u201cconcluding that a lack of corroborating evidence was a \u2018discrepancy.\u2019\u201d AB at 16. This \nargument is thoroughly unpersuasive. The Judge was confronted with two widely differing \naccounts of the November 2021 incident, which contained multiple contradictions. For one \nexample, the police report indicated that Applicant smelled strongly of alcohol when pulled over, \nadmitted to consuming one alcoholic beverage, and registered a blood alcohol content (BAC) of \n0.245% on a breathalyzer test. Conversely, Applicant steadfastly maintained that he has not \nconsumed alcohol since 1996 and submitted a letter from one of his sisters attesting to this long\u00ad\nterm abstinence. AE U.2 That is a discrepancy in the evidence. In another example, Applicant \ntestified that he told the police he needed medical attention and that, after the police dropped him \nat his home, he went to the hospital to seek treatment for his diabetic condition. The police report, \nhowever, does not reflect any request for medical attention, and the medical records from the \nhospital indicate that Applicant sought treatment for possible injuries related to an auto accident. \nIn sum and contrary to Applicant\u2019s assertion, the record was rife with contradictions and \ndiscrepancies, which was the Judge\u2019s duty to resolve. See ISCR Case No. 05-06723 at 4 (App. Bd. \nNov. 14, 2007) (\u201cA Judge is required to weigh conflicting evidence and to resolve such conflicts \nbased upon a careful evaluation of factors such as the comparative reliability, plausibility and \nultimate truthfulness of conflicting pieces of evidence.\u201d) Confronted with two entirely \ncontradictory explanations of the November 2021 event, the Judge thoroughly identified, analyzed, \nand resolved the conflicts in the evidence. Her findings and conclusions are amply supported by \nthe record. This assignment of error is without merit. \n2 Applicant argues repeatedly that the Judge erred in that she failed to consider the letter from his sister that \ncorroborates his long-term abstinence. Our review, however, confirms that the Judge reviewed the correspondence, as \nshe cites to the letter in her discussion of Applicant\u2019s claim of abstinence.

In general, we defer to a \njudge\u2019s credibility determination, as the Directive requires. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. In this case, the \nadverse credibility determination flowed directly from the Judge\u2019s resolution of the contradictory \nevidence, as detailed above. Nothing in the record or in Applicant\u2019s appeal brief gives us any \nreason to question or disturb her credibility determination. Notably, the Judge\u2019s adverse decision \nexplicitly rests on this credibility determination: \nGuideline G Analysis: \u201cBased on him being an unreliable witness, there is \ninsufficient evidence to establish mitigation under any of the above conditions.\u201d \nGuideline E Analysis: \u201cApplicant is not a credible witness. His failure to accept \nresponsibility for his misconduct and his misrepresentation of relevant facts \nindicate that he may be personally or professionally vulnerable if his criminal and \nalcohol-related misconduct were known to the community.\u201d \nWhole Person Concept: \u201cHe has not been candid about the circumstances of his \ncriminal and alcohol-related offenses.\u201d [Decision at 11, 12, 13.] \nBecause the gravamen of the Judge\u2019s decision was her determination that Applicant was not \ncredible in testifying about the November 2021 DUI, we are convinced that the error made in her \nGuideline J analysis was harmless in that a remand would not change the outcome of this case. \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief is fundamentally an argument that the Judge \nmisweighed the evidence in conducting her mitigation and whole-person analyses. None of \nApplicant\u2019s arguments, however, are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered \nall of the record evidence or to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that \nwas arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

Applicant appealed that decision, and the Appeal Board remanded it to the Judge with \ninstructions to issue a new decision. On December 4, 2023, Judge Wesley again denied Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged two financial concerns, both of which were found favorably for Applicant \nand will not be discussed further.

Now on its second appeal, Applicant again asserts the same arguments, but \napplies those to the Judge\u2019s revised decision. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nIn its decision on the initial appeal, the Board determined, inter alia, that the Judge\u2019s \nhandling of the administratively noticed materials was in error. Pursuant to the remand, the Judge \nreopened the record, provided the parties with the administrative notice documents upon which he \nrelied, and afforded them an opportunity to comment and object. He also provided the parties an \nopportunity to \u201cargue convincingly that [Applicant\u2019s] use of CBD in this case was innocent and \nundertaken with the understanding that the CBD he used was not in excess of the 0.3% legal limits \non THC in CBD products prescribed by the Federal Farm Act (Public Law 115-334).\u201d Hearing \nExhibits (HE) 1 and 2. The Judge referenced the knowledge criteria used by the Supreme Court to \nmake credibility assessments of claims of innocence as guidance. Id.; Decision at 3. The parties \nsubmitted post-remand briefs, and Applicant provided additional documents with his. HE 6-8. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis: The Judge\u2019s findings and analysis are \nsummarized and quoted below. \nApplicant is in his mid-50s, married and divorced three times, and has one teenaged child. \nHe attended college but has not earned a degree. He served in the military from 1996 to 2016 and \nwas medically discharged with a disability covering multiple pain issues throughout his body. He \nhas been employed by a defense contractor since September 2021. While employed with another \ncontractor, he tested positive for marijuana (THC) in June 2021, and was terminated from that \nemployment. Prior to appearing for his random drug test, he did not notify the Government or his \nemployer that he was ingesting CBD oil. He did not challenge the positive test results nor offer \nany explanations to his employer as to what may have caused his positive drug test. \nApplicant denied using marijuana and claimed that he tried a new CBD product \nrecommended and given to him by a friend who \u201cbrought\u201d it from Colorado. Prior to using the \nCBD oil provided by his friend, he was \u201cgifted\u201d CBD oil on two prior occasions \u201cfrom a different \nsource\u201d at a local gas station. Decision at 4. He did not check the CBD oil for enhancement with \nTHC, did not report its use on his pre-test urinalysis form, and did not list his use of CBD oil or \nhis positive urinalysis test in his recent security clearance application (SCA). He stated that he did \nnot list the positive test on his SCA because \u201che didn\u2019t think it was \u2018going to be a big issue\u2019 because \nhe had not smoked marijuana prior to his positive drug test\u201d and \u201chis use of CBD oil was not court \nrelated.\u201d Id. at 5 (quoting Tr. at 27). \nApplicant could not provide any product labels, correspondence, or other proof to verify \nhis use of CBD oil prior to testing positive for marijuana. When asked to identify the specific CBD \noil product he was taking, \u201cApplicant could not (a) identify the type of CBD product he used, (b) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndocument the labels of the product, or (c) supply any other evidence to refute the positive results \nfor marijuana\u201d reported in his June 2021 test results. Id. at 6. When given another opportunity to \nfurnish proof of his innocent acceptance of CBD oil products, he could provide no further proof \nof the CBD products used. He cut off all ties and discarded the products when he was fired, and \nhe could not document any evidence of the CBD products he used and \u201cexactly how they worked \ninto my case.\u201d Id. \nPressed further at the hearing for details on whether he checked to see whether the CBD \nproducts he used contained THC, Applicant replied that he did not look at the labels on the products \nhe obtained. He said one of the suppliers was a friend who purchased the CBD from another state \nand his other two transactions were made at a local gas station \u201cwithout any acknowledged close \nchecking of labels.\u201d Id. Applicant was unaware of whether the CBD products were sold in grocery \nstores or pharmacies, and he \u201cnever \u2018went back to look.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Tr. at 38-39). Applicant \ncould offer no proof of his claimed innocent ingestion of THC oil. \nBased on the evidence produced, interpretation of the test results \nassociated with Applicant\u2019s June 2021 positive drug test leaves only \nthree plausible explanations: (1) Applicant knew, or is imputed to \nhave known, there was THC in the CBD that exceeded or likely \nexceeded authorized federal limits; (2) Applicant did not know the \nCBD he consumed was likely to contain an excessive amount of \nTHC; or (3) Applicant consumed a substantial amount of CBD oil \neither at one time or through repeated ingestion, so that even if the \nCBD oil met federal legal limits (i.e., 0.3 per cent), it would still \nresult in a positive urinalysis test result. Application of CBD oil use \nunder either of the situations covered in (2) or (3) could produce a \nfavorable innocence result for Applicant based on a finding that he \ningested a presumably legal product. Conversely, application of the \nsituation covered [in] (1) would not. Id. \nIn his credibility assessment of Applicant\u2019s denials of any knowing use of THC-laced CBD \noil prior to his positive test, the Judge concluded that favorable explanations of his positive test \n\u201care neither plausible nor credible without more information from Applicant on the identity and \nsources of the CBD oil he claims to have obtained and used.\u201d Id. Applicant\u2019s claims of innocent \nuse \u201cwithout any effort to assess the THC content of the CBD oil products he was given are not \nenough to meet established Appeal Board credibility assessment requirements. . . . More \ncorroborating information from Applicant is needed to reconcile his claims of innocent use with \nthe positive test results.\u201d Id. at 6-7. \nThe Judge found that Applicant did not meet his evidentiary burden of proving he did not \nknow, or through reasonable inquires could not have known, that the CBD oil he obtained \ncontained THC above the 0.3% limits set by law. Without more documented explanations from \nApplicant, he failed to meet the evidentiary burden of proof. Without more time to establish \nsustained abstinence from illegal CBD oil, Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence that he is \nno longer a recurrence risk. No mitigating conditions applied. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nThe Board tasked the Judge to provide the parties with appropriate notice of materials \noutside of the record that he intended to use and to resolve apparent conflicts in the evidence, \nincluding whether Applicant knowingly used or consumed an illegal drug. Post-remand, we find \nthat adequate notice of materials relied on has been provided to the parties and requested comments \nand arguments were appropriately submitted and appended to the record. We now turn to the \npositive drug test. \nIn our initial decision in this case, we held that the applicant bears the burden of \nestablishing innocent consumption in positive drug test cases. An applicant\u2019s positive test for an \nillegal drug is sufficient to establish various Guideline H disqualifying conditions.1 Once a positive \ndrug test is proven, an applicant has the burden to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from that positive test. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. When an applicant claims the positive \ndrug test was the result of innocent use or consumption, the key issue will likely be whether he or \nshe presented sufficient evidence to prove that claim and thereby refute the pertinent SOR \nallegations. Such a determination may hinge on an assessment of the applicant\u2019s credibility. If an \napplicant successfully refutes the pertinent SOR allegations, those allegations should be resolved \nin favor of the applicant, and the judge does not need to conduct a mitigation analysis regarding \nthem. See ISCR Case No. 22-01176 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2023). \nApplicant now alleges that the Judge did not consider all relevant evidence, apply \napplicable mitigating conditions, evaluate his credibility, and evaluate the Whole-Person factors, \nincluding the positive steps he has taken in mitigation, rendering the decision arbitrary, capricious, \nand contrary to law. Applicant\u2019s brief consists, in large measure, of a disagreement with the \nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is not enough to show that the Judge weighed the \nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n19-03344, 2020 WL 82584892 at *2 (App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2020). There is a rebuttable presumption \nthat the Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states otherwise, \nand Applicant\u2019s bare assertion that the Judge did not consider evidence is not sufficient to rebut \nthat presumption. Id. Upon our review, the Judge\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence \nof record, that is, \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support \na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nThe Judge took great effort to analyze Applicant\u2019s claims of innocent ingestion of CBD oil \nthat could have triggered a positive test for THC and attempted to resolve any likely scenario \nsupporting innocent ingestion. The record supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201cApplicant did not \nmeet his evidentiary burden of proving he did not know, or through reasonable inquires could not \nhave known that the CBD oil he obtained\u201d contained THC above the 0.3% limits set by the Farm \nBill and endorsed in his home state of residence.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-01846, 2011 WL 4904418 at *2 (App. Bd. \nSep. 13, 2011). \nApplicant argues that the Judge \u201cpresented a false dichotomy that the only two plausible \nexplanations for the positive drug test are 1) [Applicant] consumed marijuana or 2) [Applicant] \npurchased \u2018poor-quality CBD oil from an unlicensed retailer of CBD produced from a hemp plant \nby an unlicensed farm source containing THC content in excess of [.3] percent.\u2019\u201d Appeal Brief at \n9 (quoting Decision at 10). He argues that the Judge failed to consider alternative explanations \nsuch as that Applicant legally purchased CBD from a licensed retailer, that the licensed retailer \npurchased the CBD from a licensed farm source, and that one or both failed to comply with \nregulatory requirements on labeling; that the Government chose not to guarantee the labeling of \nCBD oil; that the CBD oil contained no labeling disclosing the THC content; or that Applicant\u2019s \npositive drug test resulted from legal use of CBD oil with .3% THC. Id. \nApplicant presented no convincing evidence to suggest any of these scenarios likely \nresulted in his positive drug test, thereby failing to carry his burden of proof. Without presentation \nof relevant, material, and convincing evidence raising the likelihood of an alternative scenario, the \nJudge was not required to imagine and analyze every possible reason for Applicant\u2019s positive drug \ntest result. When given the opportunity to return to the local gas station where the CBD oil was \nobtained and search for evidence of a similar container, manufacturer, distributor, or label, or to \ncontact the \u201cfriend\u201d who provided the CBD oil originating from Colorado to provide a statement \nor proof of the contents, Applicant failed to act. In the end, Applicant\u2019s failure to provide sufficient \nand convincing evidence rebutting the Government\u2019s test result evidence was determinative. \nThe Judge\u2019s analysis and whole-person assessment considered Applicant\u2019s background \nand character favorably, but he concluded that the character evidence was insufficient to overcome \nthe evidentiary deficiencies with respect to his claims of innocent ingestion in light of the positive \ndrug test. The Judge reasonably concluded that \u201cfavorable alternative explanations of his positive \ndrug test are neither plausible nor credible without more information from Applicant on the \nidentity and sources of the CBD oil he claims to have obtained and used\u201d and that Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cclaims of innocent use of CBD oil without any effort to assess the THC content of the CBD oil \nproducts he was given are not enough to meet established Appeal Board credibility assessment \nrequirements.\u201d Decision at 6-7. \nThe Judge acknowledged that Applicant was committed to abandoning all involvement \nwith CBD; however, when viewed in light of only two years since his positive drug test and his \ninability to document the type of CBD oil he claimed to have used, it was insufficient to mitigate \nthe drug use concerns established under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (b), and (c).2 \n2 AG \u00b6 25(a) \u2013 any substance misuse; AG \u00b6 25(b) \u2013 testing positive for an illegal drug; AG \u00b6 25(c) \u2013 illegal possession \nof a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession \nof drug paraphernalia. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe record supports the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Applicant failed to prove his claim \nthat his positive drug test for THC resulted from innocent ingestion of CBD oil. The Judge properly \ndetermined that the only relevant mitigating condition was AG \u00b6 26(a), and that the evidence \npresented was insufficient to establish it. On appeal, Applicant contends that the Judge erred by \nfailing to properly explain why application of AG \u00b6 26(a) only garnered partial credit. Appeal Brief \nat 17. The Judge held that \u201cwithout more time to establish a probative pattern of sustained \nabstinence from the use of CBD oil,\u201d Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence \u201cthat he is no \nlonger a recurrence risk.\u201d Decision at 11. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) affords mitigation where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d The Directive is silent \non what constitutes a sufficient period of reform and rehabilitation. That silence, however, does \nnot relieve a judge of the obligation to construe and apply pertinent provisions of the Directive in \na reasonable, common-sense way. See ISCR Case No. 02-08032, 2004 WL 1434394 at *5 (App. \nBd. May 14, 2004). The Board has repeatedly held that, if the record reflects a significant period \nof time has passed without misconduct by an applicant, then the judge must articulate a rational \nbasis for concluding why that time does not demonstrate changed circumstances or conduct \nsufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation. Id. Here, the Judge adequately explained \nthat he did not consider two years as \u201cevidence of sustained abstinence\u201d in order to safely predict \nthat the risk of recurrence is low. This coupled with Applicant\u2019s \u201cinability to document\u201d the type \nof CBD oil he claims to have used inured to his detriment in establishing mitigation. \nApplicant also argues the Judge asserted facts without evidence. In particular, he takes \nissue with the Judge\u2019s discussion of how much THC must be present in CBD products to cause a \npositive drug test. We note that the Judge\u2019s administrative notice documents and the parties\u2019 \nwritten briefs adequately discuss these matters and other issues related to the laws surrounding \nCBD products. See HE 1-5. While Applicant failed to show what type of CBD product he claims \nto have used, the discussion of how much THC any particular product may contain is relevant on \nbackground, but not determinative to the ultimate security determination. \nAlthough not raised by the parties on appeal, our review of the record reveals that the Judge \nfailed to discuss the application of security concern AG \u00b6 25(f) \u2013 any illegal drug use while granted \naccess to classified information or holding a sensitive position \u2013 despite finding against Applicant \non SOR \u00b6 1.c, alleging Applicant used marijuana and tested positive after he had been granted \naccess to classified information in about 2020. Given the Judge\u2019s findings on SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.b, which we sustain, we find any error in this regard to be harmless. \nWe have considered the entirety of the arguments contained in Applicant\u2019s appeal brief. \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

He retired from the United States Navy in 2004. He married, divorced, and \nremarried in 2002, and has two children. Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to a failed \nrestaurant and lounge business. He admitted to all of the SOR allegations with explanations. \nAlthough the Judge acknowledged that neither the Chapter 11 or the Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nwas successful, he found that the initial Chapter 13 process resolved a number of Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial issues. Specifically, the Judge found that Applicant resolved 7 of the 12 alleged debts\u2014 \ntotaling approximately $82,500\u2014by payments that he made to the Chapter 13 trustee (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c\u20131.e, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.l). The Judge found an additional debt (SOR \u00b6 1.g) was resolved by payments \nmade by Applicant under a repayment plan. With regard to one charged-off credit union account \n(SOR \u00b6 1.m), the Judge found that the account was not specifically alleged so as to enable him to \nidentify the debt in relation to the bankruptcy documentation. Finally, the Judge found that three \ndebts\u2014a bank account and two credit-card accounts totaling about $41,400\u2014were not resolved \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.f, and 1.k). Decision at 4-6. \nIn his mitigation analysis, the Judge concluded: \n[D]espite receiving questionable legal support from his second bankruptcy \nattorney, Applicant apparently had a repayment plan as far back as 2016, and there \nis verifiable documentary evidence that through his varied efforts, he initiated and \nis adhering to a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors by making \nsubstantial payments for accounts that were both alleged in the SOR as well as \naccounts that were not alleged. Of the 11 alleged delinquent accounts, not including \nthe one for which I indicated that allegation was too broad with insufficient facts to \nconsider, Applicant has resolved 8 such accounts. In addition, he has resolved or is \nin the process of resolving several identified but unalleged accounts. \n. \n. \n. \nThere is evidence of financial counseling and a budget. Far more important \nis the verifiable documentary evidence of his successful efforts to resolve the eight \naccounts and his declared intentions of eventually addressing the remaining \ndelinquent accounts. Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he \nhad been as he has a small monthly remainder and his delinquent debts have been \nreduced significantly. [Decision at 10, 12.] \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, the Government challenges the Judge\u2019s factual findings as well as his \nconclusions. When an administrative judge\u2019s factual findings are challenged, the Board must \ndetermine whether the findings of fact are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the \nsame record and whether the judge\u2019s findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence as a whole. Directive, E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 2\u20133 (App Bd. Aug. 8, \n2005). In deciding whether a judge\u2019s conclusions are erroneous, the Appeal Board will review the \ndecision to determine whether it \u201cfails to examine relevant evidence, fails to articulate a rational \nconnection between the facts found and the choice made, fails to be based on a consideration of \nrelevant factors, involves a clear error of judgment, fails to consider an important aspect of the \ncase, or is so implausible as to indicate more than a mere difference of opinion.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n94-0215 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Apr. 13, 1995) (citing Motor Vehicle Mfr. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Ins. \nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). Here, we agree with the Government that the Judge erred in his \nanalysis of the evidence and made findings of fact that were not supported by the record. As a \nresult, his analysis fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a \nrational connection between the facts found and the choices made. \nThe Judge made factual findings on 12 debts. Four are not in issue on appeal. The \nGovernment concurs in the Judge\u2019s assessment that Applicant resolved the credit card debt alleged \nat SOR \u00b6 1.g and that Applicant has not resolved three SOR debts that total approximately $41,400 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.f, and 1.k). We turn now to the Judge\u2019s findings on the remaining eight allegations \nand conclude that the findings are not supported by relevant evidence. \nFirst, the Judge erred in finding that Applicant resolved seven of the SOR debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c\u20131.e, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.l) through payments made by the trustee in the partial Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nproceeding. There is simply no evidence of record to support those favorable findings and ample \nevidence to the contrary. Indeed, the documents to which the Judge cites in support of his favorable \nfindings\u2014the trustee\u2019s report and credit reports\u2014directly contradict his findings. The trustee\u2019s \nreport clearly reflects that the seven claims in issue were not paid. The only payments made by the \ntrustee under the Chapter 13 plan went towards Applicant\u2019s mortgage and his federal and state tax \ndelinquencies. GE 3 at 77. In sum, the record evidence is wholly insufficient to support the Judge\u2019s \nconclusion that these seven alleged debts, totaling approximately $82,500, were resolved. \nSecond, the Judge held that Applicant not only paid the charged-off debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 \n1.e through the trustee but that he also later paid the debt of $16,134 to a collection agent. This \nfinding is similarly unsupported by the evidence. As Department Counsel points out, the creditor\u2019s \naccount number listed by the collection agent does not coincide with the account number \nassociated with the SOR debt. Our review of the record indicates that, although Applicant \napparently resolved another delinquent account held by the same creditor, the evidence is \ninsufficient to conclude that he resolved the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nThird, the Judge found favorably for Applicant on the credit union debt at issue in SOR \u00b6 \n1.m because it was not pled with enough detail for him to determine whether it was resolved in the \npartial Chapter 13 process: \u201cBecause the unpaid balance was not alleged, and the identity of the \ndebt purchaser was not provided, it is impossible to align the necessary information to determine \nif the account was identified in the Chapter 13 bankruptcy by its own name or under the identity \nof another creditor.\u201d Decision at 6. There is considerable leeway with respect to the content of an \nSOR allegation but to be legally sufficient an allegation must place an applicant on reasonable \nnotice of the allegations against him or her so that the applicant has a meaningful opportunity to \nrespond to the allegations and prepare a defense to them. E.g., ISCR Case No. 02-23365 at 3 (App. \nBd. March 22, 2004).

Nevertheless, the Judge\u2019s finding is in error for several reasons. The allegation was \nsupported by both the Chapter 13 trustee\u2019s report (GE 3) and the Government\u2019s credit reports (GEs \n4\u20135). The trustee\u2019s report lists three accounts owed to the named credit union, and the November \n2021 and June 2022 credit reports list three charged-off debts with the same credit union. \nMoreover, the same three charged-off accounts appear in the October 2022 credit report that \nApplicant submitted at hearing (AE F at 27-29). The credit reports were sufficient to establish the \nGovernment\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had at least one SOR delinquent debt with this \nparticular credit union that was of security concern. E.g., ISCR Case No. 19-02993 at 5 (App. Bd. \nNov. 23, 2021). Moreover, as discussed above, the only payments made by the trustee were \ntowards Applicant\u2019s mortgage and his federal and state tax delinquencies. No credit unions or \ncollection agencies were paid, so the Judge\u2019s professed concern that the trustee may have made \npayments to a creditor who had purchased the debt is without basis. Most importantly, Applicant \nadmitted to the debt in his answer to the SOR. If Applicant was unclear as to which of the three \ndelinquent accounts with this credit union was in issue, he could have objected or sought \nclarification. Having instead admitted the debt, Applicant had the burden of producing evidence \nto show that it was resolved or mitigated. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. He failed to do so. There is no \nevidence of record that indicates any of the three debts to this credit union were resolved. We \nconclude that the allegation was pled with sufficient specificity and supported by sufficient \nevidence, that Applicant failed to produce evidence in mitigation of the admitted debt, and that the \nJudge erred in finding favorably for Applicant on the basis of a lack of specificity in the SOR. \nOverall, the record shows that only one of the 12 SOR debts has been resolved, contrary to \nthe Judge\u2019s findings that 9 of the 12 debts were resolved. Said differently, Applicant has resolved \napproximately $12,300 of the $136,000 delinquent debt alleged. We have often stated that a \nsecurity clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s debts. Rather, \nit is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nE.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). The scope of Guideline F \nencompasses not only an Applicant\u2019s current financial situation, but also extends to his or her \nfinancial history. As a general rule, an applicant is not required to be debt-free nor to develop a \nplan for paying off all debts immediately or simultaneously. E.g., ISCR Case No. 09-08462 at 4 \n(App. Bd. May 31, 2011). However, an applicant must act responsibly given his or her \ncircumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct \neven if it may only provide for the payment of debts one at a time. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 \n(App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nThe evidence of Applicant\u2019s failed bankruptcy filings (SOR \u00b6 1.a) along with his long\u00ad\nstanding unresolved debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.f and 1.h-1.m) indicates a history of financial \nirresponsibility and failure to meet financial obligations that have not been mitigated. Based on \nour review of the record, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s findings are not supported by record \nevidence and that his decision failed to examine relevant evidence, failed to consider an important \naspect of the case, and runs contrary to the record evidence. It is not sustainable. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision in ISCR Case No. 22-01343 is REVERSED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Gregg A.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nDecember 12, 2022, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct), and Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective \nJune 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On March 21, \n2024, after a hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Carol G. \nRicciardello denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline J 13 allegations of criminal conduct including five \nmisdemeanor traffic violations; two charges and a conviction for assault; larceny; entering military \nproperty; probation violations; and reentering military property after being banned. Under \nGuideline E, the criminal allegations above were cross alleged plus 16 traffic violations, and \nApplicant was alleged to have been debarred from a military base and terminated from \nGovernment employment for failing to disclose a job termination on Government documents. \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have seven financial accounts in collections or charged\u00ad\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noff, totaling about $28,700. Except for two financial allegations and one withdrawn criminal \nallegation, the Judge found against Applicant on all of the remaining SOR allegations. \nOn appeal, Applicant contends the Judge failed to consider all relevant evidence, misstated \nthe facts, and was biased, degrading, and unfair, rendering the decision as arbitrary, capricious, \nand contrary to law. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nThe Judge made the following findings of fact: Applicant is in his early 40s. He received a \nhigh school equivalency diploma in 2001. He is unmarried and has two teenaged children. He has \nworked for a federal contractor since 2021. Applicant has a long history of criminal conduct \nbeginning in 2004 and continuing to May 2022. In 2004, he failed to return a key he was entrusted \nwith when he worked at a fast-food restaurant and broke in at night and stole $1,200. In 2005, he \npleaded guilty to assaulting the mother of one of his children, and he has been charged and found \nguilty twice for failing to appear in court as ordered. He has been found guilty of probation \nviolations three times, including once for intentionally failing to attend an anger management class, \nfor which he was ordered to serve 50 days in jail. \nApplicant has also been charged with misdemeanor offenses involving the operation of his \nvehicle without insurance, reckless driving-wanton disregard (speeding), fictious/altered \ntitle/registration card, and driving with a revoked license. He has shown an obvious disregard for \ncomplying with the law. His conduct has occurred over the past 18 years with his latest offense \noccurring in 2022. He failed to comply with court orders, probation terms, and traffic laws. \nApplicant\u2019s falsification on government documents and sheer number of charges under \ncriminal and motor vehicle laws since 2004 raise questions about his willingness to comply with \nrules and regulations. Also, he has failed to address certain debts, including documented efforts to \ncontact creditors. He has not provided evidence that he acted responsibly or received financial \ncounseling, and his debts are recent and ongoing. \nBased on extensive criminal conduct, the Judge was unable to conclude future misconduct \nwas unlikely to recur. There is insufficient evidence of rehabilitation to mitigate his history of \ncriminal conduct. \nDiscussion \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After \nthe Government produces evidence raising security concerns, an applicant bears the burden of \npersuasion concerning mitigation. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security \nclearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the \ninterests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved \nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Encl 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b).  \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \nJudge\u2019s decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate \na satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. E.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015). \nOn appeal, Applicant alleges the following errors in the decision: the Judge confused a \nprobation violation for a parole violation in describing the 2005 offense; she did not mention that \nhe discussed his 2005 assault offense with a Government investigator; she failed to consider that \nhis 2009 fictitious tags offense was dismissed after he produced a new title and registration; she \nimplied that his 2019 assault charge and being stabbed by the mother of his child were on the same \nday; she incorrectly stated that his 2019 traffic violation was connected to an auto accident; she \nimplied that his termination from a Government position was not reported in his most current \nsecurity clearance application (SCA); and she failed to mention the debts he resolved as of 2024. \nAdditionally, Applicant alleges that he was treated unfairly by the Judge based on comments made \nduring the hearing. \nWe agree that the Judge made a minor factual error in labeling a probation violation as a \nparole violation, but we conclude that the error is harmless as it does not likely affect the outcome \nof the case. ISCR Case No. 19-01431 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2020). Applicant\u2019s other contentions \nas to how the Judge may have viewed record evidence and any implications made in the decision \nare without merit. The Judge is not required to discuss every aspect of the evidence in her decision, \nand, except for the minor error mentioned above, her findings are substantially supported by the \nevidence. We have long held that a disagreement with or an ability to argue for a different \ninterpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence \nor reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. E.g., ISCR \nCase No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s material \nfindings or conclusions are supported by substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that \ncould be drawn from the evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 3 (Jan. 14, 2020). With regard \nto additional or clarifying evidence presented on appeal, the Appeal Board is prohibited from \nconsidering new evidence on appeal and does not review cases de novo. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nFinally, Applicant raises the possibility that the Judge was biased, unprofessional, and \ninsensitive because of remarks she made during the hearing. We find the Applicant misstates the \nevidence and incorrectly quotes the record. For example, he claims the Judge stated \u201cI can\u2019t believe \nyou were hired\u201d in discussing his employment in a store loss-prevention position. Appeal Brief \n(AB) at 2. The record instead establishes that the Judge questioned Applicant to determine whether \nhe had disclosed his earlier larceny from an employer prior to being hired in a loss-prevention \nposition. Tr. 74. Similarly, Applicant claims that the Judge asked during a discussion of an incident \nin which Applicant was stabbed by his girlfriend, \u201cwhy weren\u2019t you charged?\u201d Our review of the \ntranscript confirms that the Judge instead asked a question to clarify whether the stabbing occurred \nin the same incident as an alleged assault by Applicant. Tr. at 20. Finally, Applicant states he was \noffended when Department Counsel \u201ccompar[ed] my case to a case involving child pornography \nor any type of sexual misconduct \u2026.\u201d AB at 2. In fact, Department Counsel in his closing statement \nwas citing to Appeal Board cases (including a child pornography case) in which applicants did not \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntake responsibility for their actions and/or criminal conduct was dated. Tr. at 78. The hearing \ntranscript does not support Applicant\u2019s assertions of bias or unprofessional conduct. \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our review of the \nrecord reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

On January 12, 2024, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency \nbetween January 2020 and April 2020 while granted access to classified information.

Additionally, Applicant\u2019s FORM response, dated \nMarch 23, 2023, and received April 5, 2023, included his two-page narrative and two letters of \nsupport, and was included in the case file without objection from the Government. We find no \nbasis to conclude that the Judge failed to receive any of the evidence that Applicant submitted. \nWith respect to the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant last used marijuana in 2020 instead of \n2019, we conclude that this difference either represents the Judge\u2019s weighing of conflicting \nevidence or was harmless error, neither of which warrants disturbing the decision. During his \nfollow-up security clearance interview, Applicant initially reported using marijuana twice between \nJanuary and April 2020. Government Exhibit 4 at 4. Upon confrontation by the investigator with \ninformation that Applicant used marijuana in 2019, Applicant agreed that the 2019 timeframe was \nmore likely accurate. Id. at 5. In his FORM response, Applicant reiterated that his marijuana use \noccurred in 2019, not 2020. FORM Response at 1. Contrary to his position on appeal that an \nadditional letter submitted from his witness \u201cconfirmed the listed date,\u201d neither of the reference \nletters mentions any particular date for Applicant\u2019s last marijuana use. Id. at 1, 3-5.1 \nThe Judge was not bound to disregard the date that Applicant initially reported in favor of \nthe second, conflicting date provided after confrontation during his interview or in his FORM \nresponse. Rather, a judge is required to weigh and resolve evidentiary conflicts. See ISCR Case \nNo. 05-06723, 2007 WL 4379274 at *3 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2007). Assuming first that the date \nfinding represents such a weighing and resolution, and acknowledging that it would have been \npreferable for the Judge to identify the conflicting evidence and explain why he found one date \nmore credible than the other, we find no reason not to give deference to the Judge\u2019s weighing of \nthis particular evidence. \nAssuming next that the date finding was erroneous, the Judge\u2019s ultimate adverse decision \nwas based on sustainable Guideline E grounds, rendering that finding harmless as it was used in \nhis Guideline H analysis. See ISCR Case No. 02-17276, 2005 WL 1381891 at *2 (App. Bd. Mar. \n15, 2005). To the extent that the finding constitutes error, typographical or otherwise, remand to \nthe Judge for clarification of his conclusions with respect to the Guideline H evidence has no \nsignificant chance of changing the outcome of the case and is therefore unnecessary. \n1 Applicant submitted two additional reference letters, including from 1) S.W., dated March 28, 2023; and 2) L.W., \nundated. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error.

Under Guideline E, Applicant \nis alleged to have falsified his 2022 security clearance application (SCA) by failing to report his \nuse and purchase of marijuana, including while holding a security clearance. Applicant admitted \nthe Guideline H allegations, including admitting using and purchasing marijuana after being \ngranted a security clearance and occupying a sensitive position, with an explanation that he \n\u201clegally\u201d purchased \u201can item that contained small amounts of THC from a local smoke shop,\u201d that \nhe consumed them in a \u201csafe environment\u201d outside of work, and that his use did not compromise \nhis ability to conduct his duty as a DOD contract employee. He denied the Guideline E allegations, \nclaiming his usage and purchase was not illegal. Answer to SOR. The Judge found against \nApplicant on all allegations. \nOn appeal, Applicant contends that the Judge erred in his application of the disqualifying \nconditions, rendering his decision arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. He also takes issue \nwith the choice of forum to adjudicate his clearance. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings: The Judge\u2019s findings relevant to the appeal are summarized below. \nApplicant is in his mid-40s. He is a college graduate and has worked as a program engineer \nfor defense contractors since 2005. He completed SCAs in 2002, 2012, and 2022, and has held a \nsecret security clearance since 2002. He is now seeking a top secret clearance. Decision at 2. \nApplicant completed an SCA in March 2022 wherein he denied use or purchase of illegal \ndrugs in the past seven years and denied ever using illegal drugs while possessing a security \nclearance. During his personal subject interview (PSI) by a government investigator, he admitted \nto purchasing marijuana edibles in January 2022 while vacationing out of the country. He \nconsumed one per day over the course of five days during the trip. He then disclosed that he used \nmarijuana in March 2021 after a funeral. He summarized his marijuana use as recreationally, about \ntwice a year since 2016, typically on special occasions. When asked why he did not disclose his \nmarijuana use in his SCA, he said he \u201cjust forgot about it.\u201d He said he would still use it in the \nfuture but would reserve his use to when he was in a \u201csafe environment,\u201d would not let his \nmarijuana use compromise his work quality, and would not become dependent. He confirmed that \nhe knew marijuana was federally illegal. Decision at 2-3. \nApplicant responded to interrogatories in November 2022, and provided more details of \nhis marijuana involvement. He said he first used on January 23, 2016, in State 1 and last used on \nOctober 29, 2022, in State 2 for a Halloween celebration. He purchased marijuana edibles from a \nlocal smoke shop near his residence in State 2, and last purchased on October 28, 2022. When \nasked when, if ever, he had decided to stop, he responded, \u201cI suspended use of (marijuana) during \nwork hours or when I don\u2019t feel safe. Last use was Halloween weekend (10/29/2022).

He also \ntestified to his stressors and challenges from COVID-19 and caring for his mother with dementia. \nHe used to be in counseling, but since moving to his current state, he has been unsuccessful at \nfinding a counselor. \nApplicant noted in testimony that he was \u201cwell educated\u201d on the federal illegality of \nmarijuana and stated that he had the impression that the climate of the country was not as severe \nand that \u201cit would be possible to assess one\u2019s capability to hold a clearance and be a responsible, \ncontributing member of the U.S. society, even if they\u2019ve used marijuana.\u201d Id. at 4. \nApplicant testified that the investigator asked whether he knew marijuana was still \nclassified as a Schedule 1 drug, to which he responded, \u201cI do.\u201d He stated the conversation ended, \nbut looking back, he wished the investigator had told him to stop using marijuana. He said he \nbelieved the investigator\u2019s questions regarding illegality of marijuana meant that, if he was being \nresponsible while using marijuana, it was okay. Applicant was aware of his employer\u2019s drug policy \nprohibiting the use of illegal drugs and was subject to random drug urinalysis testing as a condition \nof employment, but he said he was not concerned. Id. \nApplicant testified that, when completing his SCA, he overlooked the language in Section \n23 asking about Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity. He testified that he denied the Guideline E \nSOR allegations because he did not believe his use and purchase of marijuana on various occasions \nwas illegal at the time he completed his SCA. He asserted such activities were decriminalized in \nStates 1 and 2 at the time of his use and purchase. At the end of testimony, Applicant changed his \nanswer regarding his intent to continue using marijuana to state that he \u201cwould just discontinue \nuse.\u201d Id. at 5. \nThe Judge noted that Applicant made inconsistent statements concerning his failure to \ndisclose his illegal drug use or drug activities in his March 2022 SCA. In his April 2022 interview, \nhe told the investigator he \u201cjust forgot about it.\u201d GE 3 at 6. In his SOR response and during his \ntestimony, he asserted he did not disclose his illegal drug use or drug activities because he believed \nhis activities were not illegal.

He also did not provide a signed statement of intent to abstain from using or \npurchasing marijuana in the future. Applicant\u2019s purchase and use of marijuana while holding a \nsensitive position reflect poor judgment and raise questions about his reliability and \ntrustworthiness. His evidence in mitigation is insufficient to overcome the concerns and doubts \nabout his judgment, reliability, and overall willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nId. at 8. \nUnder Guideline E, the Judge noted that Applicant made inconsistent statements about his \nfailure to disclose his illegal drug use or drug activities in his March 2022 SCA. In his April 2022 \ninterview, he told the investigator he \u201cjust forgot about it.\u201d In his SOR response and drug \ntestimony, he stated he did not disclose his illegal drug use or drug activities because he believed \nhis activities were not illegal. The Judge held that Applicant deliberately provided false \ninformation about his use and purchase of marijuana on his SCA. She found that AG \u00b6 16(a) \napplied.3 The Judge concluded that mitigating conditions did not apply since Applicant failed to \ndisclose his illegal drug activities in his SCA. His after-the-fact discussion with the investigator \nwas insufficient to mitigate the security concerns. The late disclosures did not amount to a prompt, \ngood-faith effort to correct his prior omission in this case, and the evidence leaves her with \nquestions and doubts about whether Applicant has overcome his personal conduct security \nconcerns.

Appeal Brief (AB) at 1. In \naddition, Applicant asserts the Judge misapplied AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of relevant facts from SCA) because he thought his drug use and purchase was legal. \nHe claims that when he completed his SCA, he did not know marijuana was illegal, but that since \nhis PSI, he understood \u201cthis was not to be the case and that any purchase or usage was to be \ndocumented.\u201d He said he completed a \u201cfollow up\u201d questionnaire in late 2022 where he disclosed \nhis marijuana use (but does not recall the date). AB at 2. \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998).  \nOur examination of the record shows the Judge\u2019s application of disqualifying conditions \nwere appropriate given the evidence presented. Applicant\u2019s appeal points to a disagreement with \nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence in mitigation. Applicant provided inconsistent statements \nwith regard to his history of marijuana use and purchase, including while holding a security \nclearance, and with regard to his understanding of the legality of marijuana use. The record shows \nthat Applicant understood his marijuana use and purchases were prohibited by Federal law and his \nemployer. In addition, he failed to commit clearly and convincingly to discontinue use in the future. \nApplicant was provided with a copy of the AG with the SOR and, additionally, was made aware \nof it throughout the pre-hearing process. \nUnder Guideline H, mitigating condition \u00b6 26(b), Applicant may provide a signed \nstatement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement. His failure to provide such evidence was \nnoted by the Judge. An applicant has the burden of presenting evidence sufficient to warrant \napplication of such mitigating conditions. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-08525 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. \n22, 2005). It is an applicant\u2019s job to present evidence sufficient to mitigate the concerns raised in \nhis or her case, and the applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion that he or she should be \ngranted a clearance. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. See ISCR Case No. 16-02243 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 30, \n2018). Applicant\u2019s claim that he should have been made aware of this mitigating component and \nshould have been presented with it at some point during the investigative or hearing process is \nwithout merit. It is neither the Judge\u2019s nor Department Counsel\u2019s duty to seek additional mitigating \nevidence or otherwise undertake further investigation of the concerns raised in an SOR. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-03062 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 11, 2015).

See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 12-02371 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2014). \nApplicant continued to use marijuana after submitting his SCA and undergoing a \nbackground interview. During his interview, Applicant was questioned about his marijuana use. \nHe reluctantly disclosed greater information about his drug use as the interview progressed, and \nfurther clarified his use in a subsequent interrogatory response. His explanation at the hearing that \nhe believed the interviewer was inquiring about whether he was \u201cresponsible\u201d with his drug use is \nbaseless and contrary to the evidence. We have long held that applicants who use marijuana after \nhaving been placed on notice of the security significance of such conduct may be lacking in the \njudgment and reliability expected of those with access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019). \nThe Directive provides that \u201cillegal use of controlled substances . . . raises questions about \na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d Directive, Encl. 2, \nApp. A \u00b6 24. This paragraph defines \u201csubstance misuse\u201d as a generic term to describe, inter alia, \nthe conduct just quoted. It does not limit Guideline H concerns to habitual drug use. Rather, the \nDirective provides that any use of an illegal drug can raise security concerns. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 12-06635 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 28, 2014). This clearly addresses the kind of use to which \nApplicant has admitted. We note Applicant\u2019s argument that many states have legalized marijuana \nfor medical purposes or have simply decriminalized it. However, marijuana use remains an offense \nunder Federal law, and Applicant stated that he understood the Federal prohibition. \nApplicant provided additional evidence for the Board\u2019s consideration. We note the Appeal \nBoard is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. Finally, \nApplicant argues that he should not have lost his Secret clearance as a result of the denial of his \nTop Secret clearance and requests to retain his Secret level clearance at a minimum. The Board \nhas no authority to deny Applicant a higher-level clearance while permitting him to retain a lower-\nlevel clearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-11627 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 18, 2005). The Directive \nmakes no distinction concerning basic clearance levels in its procedures for deciding whether \naccess to classified information is clearly in the national interest. Possession of a previously \ngranted clearance does not give rise to any right or vested interest, nor does any favorable clearance \ndecision preclude the Government from reassessing a person's security eligibility in light of current \ncircumstances. ISCR Case No. 03-24144 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 6, 2005). \nNone of Applicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner \nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Applicant has failed to establish that the Judge \ncommitted any harmful error or that he should be granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is \nsustainable on the record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 \n(1988).

In his response to the original SOR, Applicant had denied all allegations and also \nasserted that the debts were the responsibility of his former spouse. The Judge considered that \namplifying information in reaching his decision finding against Applicant on all allegations. \nOn appeal, Applicant asserts that he \u201cthink[s] that the decision was made without allowing \nme to speak or provide proof.\u201d This potentially raises a question of due process. ISCR Case No. \n22-01317 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2023). However, Applicant\u2019s assertion is incorrect. In both his \nresponse to the original SOR and to the amended SOR, Applicant specifically elected a decision \nbased upon the administrative record. Enclosure 3 of the Directive explains the differences \nbetween a hearing and a decision based on the written record. Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.17, E3.1.18. \nApplicant was provided a copy of the Directive when he received the original and amended SORs. \nWith this information available to him, he chose to have his case decided on the written record. \nNothing in either the record or Applicant\u2019s appeal brief indicates that he lacked the mental \ncompetence or basic ability to make that decision. \nApplicant received the FORM on March 8, 2024, and was given 30 days from its receipt \nto file objections or submit additional matters. The FORM contained the Government\u2019s exhibits \nand advised him that, if he did not file objections or submit additional matters, his case would be \nassigned to a Judge \u201cfor a determination based solely on this FORM.\u201d FORM at 5. Applicant did \nnot submit a response to the FORM and the case was submitted for decision on May 13, 2024. The \nguidance contained in the Directive, the FORM, and the cover letter that accompanied it were \nsufficient to apprise a reasonable person of his or her rights and responsibilities. E.g., ADP Case \nNo. 15-00020 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 4, 2016). If Applicant wanted the Judge to consider matters that \nwere not contained in the FORM, it was his obligation to provide that information. ISCR Case No. \n17-02974 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2018). To the extent that Applicant is claiming his right to submit \nevidence was somehow impaired, we conclude such a contention is without merit. Merely because \nhe now has decided that he might have presented a better case if he had proceeded differently, it \ndoes not follow that he was denied the opportunity to prepare and present his case. ISCR Case No. \n00-0086 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2000). \nAs a substantive matter, Applicant asserts that \u201cthe information that this decision was based \non is incorrect.\u201d However, each of the debts is documented in the credit bureau reports that were \nsubmitted by the Government in the FORM. Applicant did not offer any evidence in support of an \nargument that those reports were erroneous or that he had made any efforts to dispute those debts. \nIn essence, Applicant is advocating for an alternative weighing of the evidence. An \napplicant\u2019s disagreement with the judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability to argue for a \ndifferent interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that the judge weighed the \nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. E.g., \nISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Moreover, Applicant\u2019s arguments fail to \nrebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence. \nWe have considered the entirety of the arguments contained in Applicant\u2019s appeal brief. \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made.\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nFebruary 22, 2023, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) (SEAD 4) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On March 21, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for a \ntrustworthiness designation. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged 14 delinquent debts totaling approximately $110,000. The Judge found \nin favor of Applicant on seven alleged debts and against her on the remaining allegations. \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant does not allege the Judge erred. Instead, she argues for \nreconsideration of the Judge\u2019s decision and requests an opportunity to demonstrate her intent to \nresolve debts in the future. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in her early 50s and has worked for her current employer for about one year. \nShe completed an associate degree in 2007, using student loans to fund her degree. She enrolled \nin a bachelor\u2019s degree program the day before her hearing. She has never made a payment towards \nher student loans, and they were in a default status until sometime in 2022. She has applied to \nrehabilitate her student loans, and if accepted, hopes to start a repayment plan. \nApplicant began contacting creditors shortly before her hearing. She resolved medical \ndebts and two other accounts. She has made payment arrangements, settled a debt, and agreed to \nfuture payments on other SOR debts. However, the Judge held that Applicant\u2019s attempts to resolve \naccounts occurred almost a year after receiving the SOR and did not demonstrate responsible \nactions or that her future financial issues are unlikely to recur. Her participation in financial \ncounseling does not overcome her history of financial irresponsibility. \nDiscussion \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief does not assert that the Judge committed any harmful error, nor \ndoes she dispute the Judge\u2019s findings or conclusions. Rather, she acknowledges her financial status \nand asserts her intent and determination to rectify it in the future. \nApplicant\u2019s arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the \nevidence, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that she weighed the evidence or reached \nconclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. ISCR Case No. 06-17409 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to \ndemonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Id. \nThe Appeal Board does not review cases de novo.  The Board\u2019s authority to review a case \nis limited to cases in which the appealing party has alleged the Judge committed harmful error. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32. Because Applicant has not alleged such a harmful error, the decision of the \nJudge denying Applicant security clearance eligibility is sustainable. \nThe standard applicable to trustworthiness cases is that set forth in Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), regarding security clearances: such a determination \u201cmay be \ngranted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u201d\u2019 ADP Case No. \n19-01882 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2020). None of Applicant\u2019s arguments are sufficient to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record, nor are they enough to \nshow that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary \nto law.
