    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $524,191 for four delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.d). The $67,363 debt alleged at SOR 1.c is for unpaid federal income taxes for the 2014 tax year. The $425,873 debt alleged at SOR 1.d is for a delinquent small business loan being enforced by a civil judgment against Applicant, whose pay is being garnished at a rate of $400 every other week. In response, Applicant denied SOR 1.a \u2013 1.c, but admitted SOR 1.d.

(Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 35, 41) \n \n \nThe remaining SOR allegations are supported by Applicant\u2019s e-QIP disclosures, \nhis responses to DOHA interrogatories and the SOR, and three credit reports obtained \nduring Applicant\u2019s background investigation and by DOD CAF adjudicators. In addition to \nthe facts thus established, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 63 years old and employed by a defense contractor in a position that \nrequires eligibility for a position of trust, because his duties include safeguarding \npersonally identifiable information (PII) and access to sensitive facilities. Applicant has \nworked for his current employer since January 2017. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 38) \n                                                 \n1 Required by DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive). \n \n2 The current adjudicative guidelines were issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, \n2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n3 AX E is a letter of recommendation, dated December 16, 2018 (one page); AX F is a repayment agreement \nregarding the debt alleged at SOR 1.a, dated March 28, 2018 (one page); AX G is a billing statement from \nApplicant\u2019s accountant, dated May 31, 2016 (one page); AX H is billing and payment information from a tax \npreparation service, dated June 6, 2013 (two pages); and AX I is a copy of Applicant\u2019s most recent \nperformance evaluation, dated November 27, 2018 (five pages). \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nAfter graduating from high school, Applicant received training as a paramedic and \nhas worked in that field for most of his adult life. He and his wife have been married since \nJuly 1982. He has three children, all adults with children of their own. Applicant and his \nfamily lived in State A until 2001. Since then, he has resided in State B, residing in, and \npaying the mortgage for, a house owned by his late father. Applicant currently is the sole \nincome earner for his wife, who is medically disabled, and two of his adult children and \ntheir three children, two of whom have special needs. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; AX A; AX D; \nTr. 51 \u2013 54) \n \n \nIn 1998, while working in State A as a self-employed paramedic, Applicant sought \nto expand his business by seeking a contract for non-emergency patient transport \nservices with a city in State A. As a prerequisite for such a contract, he obtained from the \ncity a certificate of need for those services. That certificate was valid for a limited period \nof time, in which it was incumbent on Applicant to get his business up and running. To \nthat end, he obtained approval for a loan to be guaranteed by the Small Business \nAdministration (SBA) through a local bank. With part of the money he had requested in \nhand, Applicant proceeded to obtain equipment and to lease and renovate a building to \nhouse his business. Unfortunately, the bank that was to provide the loan failed to fully \nfund the loan Applicant had requested. Before Applicant could resolve matters with the \nbank (which later went out of business), the certificate of need expired and Applicant \ncould not begin doing business with the city as he had planned. He had to auction off the \nequipment he had purchased, but still owed between $150,000 and $200,000 for the \nportion of the loan that was funded, which he could not afford to pay. (Answer; GX 1; GX \n2; AX A; Tr. 32 \u2013 35, 54 \u2013 58)  \n \n \nIn 2002, after the original lender went out of business, the creditor listed in SOR \n1.d bought the account and obtained a civil judgment against Applicant to enforce the \ndebt through levy and wage garnishment. Over the past 18 years, the amount owed under \nthat judgment, has grown to more than $608,000 as a result of a 10 percent interest rate \nassigned to the debt. Starting in 2002, every time Applicant has obtained new \nemployment, as much as 25 percent of his pay has been garnished by the creditor. On \none occasion, the garnishment made it more advantageous for Applicant to choose to \ncollect unemployment and public assistance rather than work for a net income that was \ninsufficient, after garnishment, to support his family. In 2014, Applicant exhausted his \nretirement savings account ($8,700) in an unsuccessful attempt to settle this debt. \nCurrently, $400 of Applicant\u2019s bi-weekly pay is garnished for this debt. In 2013, Applicant \nconsulted a bankruptcy attorney who advised him that he could not include an SBA-\nguaranteed loan in a bankruptcy petition. At the current rate of wage garnishment, \nApplicant will be unable to resolve the SOR 1.d debt in his lifetime.  (Answer; GX 1; GX \n2; AX A; AX B; Tr. 26 \u2013 27, 41 \u2013 43, 60 \u2013 61) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s business continued after his failed attempt to expand. He did not wrap \nup the incorporated business until 2016. The tax debt addressed in SOR 1.c arose after \nhe used a nationally-known tax service to prepare his state and federal returns starting in \n2014. That tax service characterized Applicant\u2019s business as a Subchapter-S corporation, \nmeaning that any income from the business flowed through the business to Applicant as \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \npersonal income. Because of these complications, Applicant was late in filing his tax \nreturns between 2012 and 2015.4 In 2016, when Applicant filed his 2014 tax return, it \nresulted in a debt for unpaid income taxes totaling about $50,000. That debt has since \ngrown, through interest and penalties, to nearly $68,000. In 2016, Applicant consulted \nwith an accountant who advised that filing as a Subchapter-S corporation was a mistake \nand that he should have filed as a sole proprietor. Applicant has no outstanding federal \nand state income tax returns and he is currently negotiating a monthly repayment plan \nwith the IRS. He does not yet know how much he will have to pay, but he has obtained a \nsecond job with a medical transport company to earn the extra money he will need for \nthat debt. Applicant disclosed the debt in his e-QIP, but it is not listed as a delinquency in \nany of the credit reports obtained by the Government. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 5; AX A; AX B; \nAX G; AX H; Tr. 34 \u2013 36, 43 \u2013 48, 50, 59 \u2013 60) \n \n \nIn addition to being self-employed, Applicant worked in several paramedic and \nemergency medical services positions between 2002 and 2016. A job as a paramedic on \nan offshore oil platform provided him with a significant increase in pay and benefits; \nhowever, he lost that job in May 2016 due to a fall in oil prices that resulted in numerous \noil-industry layoffs. Applicant was unemployed from May 2016 until being hired for his \ncurrent job in January 2017. While he was unemployed, Applicant relied on \nunemployment benefits and food assistance programs to support his family. He also used \na credit card to make ends meet, but he was unable to stay current on the balance due. \nThat debt is reflected in SOR 1.a. After Applicant started his current job and again had a \nsteady income, he entered into a repayment agreement whereby he would pay $100 \nmonthly on this debt. In March 2018, Applicant negotiated a new repayment plan and now \npays $25 monthly until February 2019, at which time he will be able make further \nsettlement arrangements. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 5; AX A; AX F; Tr. 36 \u2013 37, 40) \n \n \nApplicant currently has little money remaining each month after expenses, \nincluding debt repayments and garnishments. His wife suffers from serious medical \nproblems, the medications for which cost as much as $3,000 each month. His medical \ninsurance only covers 80 percent of her medical bills. He and his wife have applied for \nSocial Security disability benefits, but that process is not likely to finish for another year. \nApplicant has not incurred any new unpaid debts since he started working again in \nJanuary 2017. He is well-regarded by his current supervisor as reliable, honest, \nhardworking, and professional. Applicant\u2019s only performance evaluation to date reflects \nexcellent work and trustworthiness. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 5; AX A; AX E; AX I; Tr. 48 \u2013 50) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEligibility for a position of public trust must be based on a determination that it is \n\u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security\u201d to do so.5 All such adjudications \n                                                 \n4 He is now current on all of his state and federal income tax reporting. (GX 2; Tr. 31, 48) \n \n5 Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Appendix A, Paragraph 1(d).  \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nmust adhere to the procedural protections in the Directive before any adverse \ndetermination may be made. Each decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,6 \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policies in the adjudicative \nguidelines. Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors, commonly referred to \nas the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, listed in the guidelines at AG \u00b6 2(d).7 The presence or \nabsence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, \nspecific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured \nagainst them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of eligibility \nfor a position of trust. \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a position of trust for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one is entitled to a position of \ntrust, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. A person who has access to \nsensitive information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on \ntrust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring \napplicants possess the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of one who will \nprotect sensitive information as his or her own. Any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access should be resolved in favor of the Government. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nThe facts established by this record reasonably raise a trustworthiness concern \nabout Applicant\u2019s finances that is addressed, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 18, as follows: \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n                                                 \n6 Directive, 6.3. \n \n7  (1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, \nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's \nage and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the \nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence. \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose from a failed expansion of his small business \nbetween 1998 and 2000. The original debt incurred (alleged at SOR 1.d) was about one-\nthird of the amount he now owes. For about 15 years, this obligation has been addressed \nthrough involuntary wage garnishment at a rate that will never result in full repayment, \nespecially with an ongoing 10 percent interest rate. Additionally, Applicant incurred a debt \n(alleged at SOR 1.c) for unpaid taxes as a result of a 2014 income tax year return filed \nas a Subchapter-S corporation rather than as a sole proprietorship. Finally, Applicant \naccrued unpaid debt (alleged at SOR 1.a) from his reliance on a credit card to meet \nexpenses while he was unemployed for eight months before being hired by his current \nemployer. Applicant has been repaying that debt through a plan agreed to by the creditor \nin early 2017. Aside from the debt at SOR 1.b, which was actually his late father\u2019s account, \nnone of the debts alleged in the SOR have been resolved. This information requires \napplication of the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); 19(c) \n(a history of not meeting financial obligations); and 19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax as required). \n \nThe following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions are potentially applicable here: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n \n \nAs to Applicant\u2019s delinquent small business loan at SOR 1.d, but for the failure of \nhis bank to fully fund the SBA loan on which he relied to start his business, Applicant \nwould at least have been able to expand his business rather than default on that obligation \n20 years ago. Applicant has paid what he can, even liquidating his retirement savings. He \nalso was advised that he cannot liquidate this debt through bankruptcy. Although wage \ngarnishment is involuntary, it is the route this creditor has chosen to pursue in its claim \nagainst Applicant, but it will never result in satisfaction of the debt. Applicant, for his part, \ncontinues to work and has adjusted his finances to the best of his ability to support his \nfamily with what remains after the garnished wages are deducted from his pay. \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n \nAs to Applicant\u2019s unpaid taxes, it is not clear that a delinquency exists. No such \nentry is found in his credit history. Nonetheless, he acknowledges the debt and is ready \nto make what payments he can by taking a second job. Although not specifically alleged, \nApplicant was late in filing some of his tax returns between 2012 and 2015. He has since \nbrought his filing status current and is working with the IRS to establish an affordable \nrepayment plan for his 2014 taxes. \n \n \nFinally, soon after he was hired by his current employer, Applicant established a \nrepayment plan with the collection agency for a credit card account he used to excess \nwhile unemployed. His efforts to resolve that account continue. Based on all of the \nforegoing, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s debts arose from unusual circumstances and events \nthat were beyond his control. Applicant experienced an unexpected failure by his bank in \n1998 and debt from a poorly executed tax return in 2016. Additionally, he has had to \nsupport his entire family, including his disabled wife, thus limiting his ability to make more \nprogress on those debts that he might be able to resolve. In response to those \ncircumstances, Applicant has tried to address his debts to the best of his ability, and to \nmanage his finances responsibly so as to avoid any additional unpaid debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \nand 20(b) apply. \n \n \nThe continued presence of unpaid debts is not, by itself, disqualifying. Financial \nproblems present a two-fold inquiry. First, does the presence of unpaid debt or other \nunresolved financial burdens present a likelihood that Applicant would resort to illegal acts \nor other conduct that might compromise national interests? Here, that appears unlikely. \nApplicant is a solid employee with an excellent record in his current position. His employer \nsupports Applicant\u2019s request for eligibility and regards Applicant as a trustworthy and \nintegral member of his team. In addition, Applicant has worked steadily in his chosen \nprofession for most of his adult life, he is working a second job solely to repay his tax \ndebt, and he has no record of improper conduct of any kind. \n \n \nSecond, did Applicant\u2019s financial problems arise from irresponsible decisions, poor \njudgment, or other factors that indicate he is unreliable or untrustworthy? I conclude they \ndid not. Applicant\u2019s tax and small business debts arose from circumstances beyond his \ncontrol. His credit card debt accrued during a period of unemployment and, under the \ncircumstances, was an understandable use of personal credit, which he is now repaying.  \nAt present, his personal finances are sound, in that, he is able to meet all of his current \nobligations. The record evidence as a whole regarding Applicant\u2019s judgment is sufficient \nto mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial problems. \n \n \nI have evaluated the facts and have applied the appropriate adjudicative factors \nunder Guideline F. I also have reviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-\nperson factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Although Applicant is not debt-free, his response to his \nfinancial problems has been prudent under the circumstances. Combined with the \nfavorable information about his character and reliability, this record supports a fair and \ncommonsense conclusion in favor of Applicant. \n \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to occupy a position of trust. Applicant\u2019s request for public trust \neligibility is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________ \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

When he responded to the SOR allegations, Applicant admitted the foreign ties, but he also explained that his spouse has U.S. permanent residency, and that she submitted the paperwork required to continue her green card. He indicated that while both of his spouse\u2019s sisters are Russian citizens, one of her sisters has been a resident of the United States since 2008 and has U.S. permanent residency. Applicant explained that his stepdaughter is employed as an elementary school teacher in Russia, and he no longer provides her any financial assistance. Applicant admitted that his spouse shares ownership of her former residence in Russia with her daughter, but she intends to transfer full ownership to her daughter. Applicant explained that his spouse will have to renew her internal Russian passport to transfer the property, which she intends to do when they travel to Russia to see her daughter in 2018.

The SOR explained why the DOD CAF \nwas unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n10/15/2018\n\n \n \n2 \nApplicant responded to the SOR on February 12, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn April 18, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. On April 23, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for May 16, 2018. \n \nAt the hearing, two Government exhibits (GEs 1-2) were admitted.

At the Government\u2019s \nrequest and without objection from Applicant, I agreed to take administrative notice of \nseveral facts pertinent to the Russian Federation (Russia). Seven Applicant exhibits (AEs \nA-G) were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant and his spouse testified, as \nreflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on June 5, 2018. \n \nI held the record open after the hearing, initially for three weeks, for Applicant to \nsubmit facts for administrative notice and additional evidence. At Applicant\u2019s request, I \ntwice extended the due date for submissions. On June 22, 2018, Applicant timely \nsubmitted corrections to the transcript and two documents consisting of his comments on \nthe oral testimony (AE H) and summaries of six decisions of DOHA administrative judges. \nOn June 25, 2018, the Government expressed no objection to the clarifications to the \ntranscript, but indicated that the decisions of DOHA judges in other cases are not binding \nprecedent. I accepted the comments on the oral testimony as AE H, but informed the \nparties that I would consider the case summaries as a supplement to Applicant\u2019s closing \nargument.  \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government requested administrative notice of several facts \npertinent to Russia, as set forth in an Administrative Notice request dated March 15, 2018. \nThe Government\u2019s request was based on excerpts of U.S. government publications, \nstatements for the record before Congress, and press releases and statements from U.S. \ngovernment entities as referenced in the document.1 \n \nPursuant to my obligation to take administrative notice of the most current political \nconditions in evaluating Guideline B concerns (see ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. \nApr. 12, 2007)), I informed the parties of my intention to take administrative notice, subject \nto the reliability of the source documentation and the relevance and materiality of the facts \nproposed. Applicant confirmed his receipt of the Government\u2019s Administrative Notice \n                                                 \n1 The Government\u2019s request for administrative notice was based on a May 11, 2017 statement for the record \nby the Director of National Intelligence before the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (I); on the \nOffice of the National Counterintelligence Executive\u2019s Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection \nand Industrial Espionage, 2009-2011, dated October 2011 (II); on press releases and press statements \nfrom the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. State Department, and the U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity (III-XII); on the State Department\u2019s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016-Russia, \nand its crime and safety reports for Moscow for 2016 and 2017. I was provided extracts of the documents \nand the web addresses for the full articles. \n\n \n \n3 \nrequest with extracts of the source documents. Applicant filed no objections to the facts \nset forth in the Government\u2019s Administrative Notice request. He accepted an opportunity \nto propose additional facts for administrative notice, but did not submit any facts for \nadministrative notice other than some comments included in AE H. \n \n \nConcerning the press releases of reported criminal activity of Russian agents and \nspies and of export violations on Russia\u2019s behalf, they were presented by the Government \napparently to substantiate that Russia engages in espionage against the United States \nand actively pursues collection of U.S. economic and proprietary information. Neither \nApplicant, his spouse, nor any of her family members were implicated in that criminal \nactivity. With that caveat, the facts administratively noticed are set forth below. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s spouse is a Russian citizen \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a); that Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter (SOR \u00b6 1.b), parents-in-law (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and \ntwo sisters-in-law (SOR \u00b6 1.d) are resident citizens of Russia; that Applicant provides \nfinancial support to his stepdaughter in Russia (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and that Applicant\u2019s spouse \nhas an ownership interest in property in Russia (SOR \u00b6 1.f). When he responded to the \nSOR allegations, Applicant admitted the foreign ties, but he also explained that his spouse \nhas U.S. permanent residency, and that she submitted the paperwork required to \ncontinue her green card. He indicated that while both of his spouse\u2019s sisters are Russian \ncitizens, one of her sisters has been a resident of the United States since 2008 and has \nU.S. permanent residency. Applicant explained that his stepdaughter is employed as an \nelementary school teacher in Russia, and he no longer provides her any financial \nassistance. Applicant admitted that his spouse shares ownership of her former residence \nin Russia with her daughter, but she intends to transfer full ownership to her daughter. \nApplicant explained that his spouse will have to renew her internal Russian passport to \ntransfer the property, which she intends to do when they travel to Russia to see her \ndaughter in 2018. (Answer.) \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old computer systems engineer with a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nelectrical engineering awarded in 1983. During his senior year of college, Applicant was \nin a U.S. military engineering program. On his graduation, he honorably served on active \nduty in the United States military until September 1987. He held a security clearance for \nhis military duties and was trained to recognize potential threats from foreign sources. He \nwas discharged from the inactive reserve in 1994. Applicant then spent his career in the \ncommercial sector before commencing his current employment with a defense contractor \nin May 2016 after receiving an interim security clearance. (GEs 1-2; AE E; Tr. 131-136, \n144-145.) \n \nApplicant was married to his first wife from 1989 to 2009. He has two sons ages \n26 and 16 and two daughters ages 23 and 19 from that marriage. He bought his present \n\n \n \n4 \nhome in 1990. (GE 1.) He started dating about six years after his divorce, but he traveled \ntoo much for the women he dated, some of whom he met on U.S. online dating sites. He \nthen viewed several dating websites based abroad, including Asian, South American, \nUkrainian, and Russian websites. (Tr. 147-149.) \n \nIn late July 2014, Applicant voluntarily resigned from his job to take a one-year \nbreak from employment to travel, including with his son, who was serving in the U.S. \nmilitary. (Tr. 163.) In September 2014, Applicant began corresponding with his current \nspouse, a native Russian citizen, whose profile he accessed on a British dating website. \nShe was born in 1971, when the country was part of the Soviet Union. She never joined \nthe Communist party but was a member of a conservative youth organization while \ngrowing up. Her parents were teenagers when she was born, and they divorced when \nshe and her twin sister were in elementary school. After her parents\u2019 divorce, Applicant\u2019s \nspouse and twin sister lived in their grandparents\u2019 home, initially with their mother. Their \nmother, who twice remarried, lived with them on and off. At times, she resided in the same \ncity, and Applicant\u2019s spouse and her sister were able to visit their mother. Their father \nwas out of their lives until they were in high school, and he began to tutor them in \nmathematics to prepare for their university studies. Their father had remarried and had a \nfamily of his own. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 46-48, 56-57, 70-71, 75-76, 100.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse was an exchange student in the United States during the 1990 \nto 1991 academic school year. After graduating from a Russian university with a degree \nin mathematics, she married in 1992, and had a daughter a year later. She and her first \nhusband divorced in 2001. Her ex-husband is an electrical engineer and works for a \nmanufacturing company. Applicant\u2019s spouse focused on raising her daughter and working \nas a senior manager in the commercial sector. In March 2013, Applicant\u2019s spouse and \nher daughter purchased the apartment in Russia in which her daughter currently resides. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse owns a 40% interest in the property. (GEs 1-2; AEs D, H; Tr. 53-56, \n77, 80.) \n \nAfter some email exchanges and Skype contact with his spouse, Applicant traveled \nto Russia to meet his spouse in person in October 2014. Because he stayed in her private \nhome, he and his spouse registered his stay with the local police as was required by \nRussian law.2  She showed Applicant around Moscow, and they had dinner with her \ndaughter during that trip. After that visit, in November 2014, Applicant applied for a fianc\u00e9e \nvisa for his spouse to immigrate to the United States in case they developed a lasting \nrelationship. She was reluctant because she wanted to stay in Russia until her daughter \n                                                 \n2 Information from the U.S. State Department indicates that U.S. citizens traveling on U.S. passports are \nrequired to have a current U.S. passport and appropriate visa for entry to Russia, and to obtain a visa, there \nmust be a Russian sponsoring organization or individual. Foreigners entering Russia are fingerprinted. \nStays in Russia exceed seven days require registration of both visa and migration card with the General \nAdministration for Migration Issues of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and passports and migration cards \nmust be carried at all times while in Russia. The migration card is provided by border officials on entry into \nRussia.  See U.S. State Department\u2019s publication Quick Facts\u2014Russia, update on March 30, 2018, which \nmay be accessed at www.state.gov. Applicant\u2019s spouse as a Russian citizen presumably sponsored \nApplicant\u2019s entry.  \n \n\n \n \n5 \nhad graduated from college and started a career, but agreed after Applicant promised to \nsupport her daughter until her daughter graduated from college. Applicant\u2019s intention was \nnot to pressure his spouse. He wanted to start what he believed would be a multi-year \nprocess. (GE 1; AE G; Tr. 57-61, 106, 137-138.) \n \n In January 2015, Applicant\u2019s spouse came to the United States on a tourist visa \nto see Applicant and meet his family.3 She traveled on her Russian passport valid to 2020. \nIn March 2015, she returned to the United States and stayed with Applicant for \napproximately six months. Applicant sent $3,000 in financial support to his stepdaughter \nin college in Russia during that time. His stepdaughter was initially able to find only a part- \ntime job on her graduation from college in June 2015. In September 2015, Applicant\u2019s \nspouse returned to Russia to complete the requirements for her fianc\u00e9e visa. She \nimmigrated to the United States on that visa in early October 2015, and she and Applicant \nmarried later that month. In December 2015, Applicant and his spouse sent her daughter \n$600 as a Christmas gift. In March 2016, Applicant\u2019s spouse acquired U.S. permanent \nresidency status valid for two years. (GEs 1-2; AEs A, C; Tr. 58-61, 91-92, 111, 114-117, \n137, 164.) She began working part time as a receptionist at a school. (Tr. 63.) \n \nIn December 2015, Applicant lost his job in a layoff. In late March 2016, Applicant \ncompleted and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions \n(SF 86) for a position with his employer that was contingent on him obtaining an interim \nsecurity clearance. He disclosed that his spouse and her twin sister are Russian citizens \nresiding in the United States with U.S. permanent residency, but that his spouse\u2019s \ndaughter, parents, and a younger half-sister are Russian resident citizens.4 He indicated \nthat his spouse\u2019s daughter worked at a government school in Russia. She started that job \nin January 2016. (AE B.) Applicant explained that he had met his stepdaughter during his \ntrip to Russia in October 2014. Applicant also indicated that his spouse\u2019s mother, who is \nretired, had visited him and his spouse in the United States in July 2015. Applicant had \nnot met his spouse\u2019s father, who was employed by a Russian university. Applicant had \nlimited contact with his spouse\u2019s half-sister in Russia and knew nothing about her \nemployment. Applicant disclosed that his spouse has a foreign financial interest \nconsisting of a 40% share in property worth about $38,000 USD co-owned with her \ndaughter in Russia. Applicant also disclosed that he had provided approximately $3,400 \nin financial support for his stepdaughter before she graduated from college in 2015, but \nhas since then only sent birthday and Christmas gifts. Applicant listed his foreign trip to \nRussia in October 2014 to meet his spouse. (GE 1.) \n \nIn April 2016, Applicant and his spouse traveled to her native city in Russia for ten \ndays to visit her relatives, including her mother, half-sister, and paternal grandmother. \n(AE H; Tr. 61.) They spent most of their time there and went to a restaurant with her \n                                                 \n3 Applicant\u2019s spouse apparently had a three-year tourist visa, which she obtained to visit her twin sister who \nhas lived in the United States since 2008. (Tr. 116.) \n \n4 Applicant\u2019s spouse testified that her younger sister is her mother\u2019s daughter from her third husband. (Tr. \n51.) \n \n\n \n \n6 \nfamily, including her father and half-brother, to celebrate their October 2015 wedding. \nThey stayed with his spouse\u2019s half-sister when in Russia. None of his spouse\u2019s relatives \nasked them for information that would be of possible interest to the Russian government, \nincluding its intelligence services. At Applicant\u2019s request, they went to his stepdaughter\u2019s \nschool where he answered questions for some of the students.5 Applicant\u2019s spouse \ntranslated for him because he does not speak Russian apart from a few words. Later that \nday, they met with some high school students who asked Applicant questions, primarily \nin English, about life, schools, and culture in the United States. (AE H; Tr. 61-68, 107-\n108, 142.)  \n \nIn January 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant explained that he met his spouse \nthrough an online dating website, and in October 2014, he traveled to Russia to meet her \nin person. He listed in-person contact with his spouse in November 2014, January 2015, \nand from March 2015 to September 2015, before their marriage in the United States in \nOctober 2015. Applicant indicated that he had in-person contact with his stepdaughter \nthree times, and contact with her by social media weekly. Applicant denied having met \nhis father-in-law in person, and that he had any contact with his father-in-law.6 He related \nthat he had social media contact on a weekly basis with his mother-in-law in Russia and \nwith his spouse\u2019s twin sister in the United States. As for his spouse\u2019s half-sister in Russia, \nApplicant indicated that he had in-person contact with her in June 2015, and contact by \nsocial media once a quarter. He denied any knowledge of her occupation or of her \nemployment. Applicant indicated that his spouse still co-owned her former residence in \nRussia. (GE 2.) \n \nIn mid-January 2017, Applicant sent his stepdaughter $1,350, of which $1,000 was \na combined birthday and Christmas present for her. The $350 was Applicant and his \nspouse\u2019s contribution to the cost of a burial headstone for his spouse\u2019s grandmother. (AE \nC; Tr. 155-156.) In May 2017, his stepdaughter was awarded her master\u2019s degree. (AE \nB.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has been employed full time since early 2017 for a commercial \ncompany. (Tr. 63.) She does not intend to return permanently to Russia. (Tr. 89.) She \napplied to renew her U.S. permanent residency, and on January 2018, the United States \nextended her conditional resident status for one year authorizing her continued \nemployment and travel in the United States pending a decision on her petition to remove \nthe conditions on her U.S. residency. (AE A; Tr. 90.) She has not notified the Russian \n                                                 \n5 Applicant indicated in his Answer that his stepdaughter started permanent employment as an elementary \nschool teacher in January 2016. Applicant\u2019s spouse testified that her daughter does not have a teaching \ndegree. She is \u201ca psychologist with the sake of kids.\u201d (Tr. 83.) It is unclear whether her daughter teaches \nor is a school psychologist at the government-owned elementary school. \n \n6 This denial of any in-person contact with his father-in-law as of January 2017 contradicts other evidence. \nAt his hearing, Applicant and his spouse acknowledged that they traveled to Russia in April 2016. Applicant \nhad not met his father-in-law when he completed his SF 86 in March 2016. He met his father-in-law at the \nparty with her family at a restaurant in Russia in April 2016. (Tr. 107-108.) \n \n\n \n \n7 \nauthorities of her current address in the United States or of her permanent residency \nstatus in the United States.7 (Tr. 110.) She intends to apply for U.S. citizenship in the \nfuture. (Tr. 118.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse exchanges greetings with her daughter in Russia every day. \nThey have a very close relationship and engage in longer conversations every two weeks. \nShe converses with her daughter in Russian. Her daughter knows little English. Applicant \nand his spouse plan to travel to Russia to visit her daughter in October 2018. Her \ndaughter, who is still employed by the elementary school, has no plans to move to the \nUnited States and has never traveled to the United States. Two or three times, her \ndaughter applied for a visa to travel to the United States to visit her mother and was \ndenied. Applicant\u2019s spouse believes the United States denied a visa to her daughter \nbecause she is in \u201ca risk category\u201d in that she might not leave the United States were she \nto visit. Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter and her boyfriend live in the apartment that she co-owns \nwith her mother. Since her daughter plans to stay in Russia, Applicant\u2019s spouse intends \nto transfer full ownership to her daughter. Applicant\u2019s spouse had a Russian internal \npassport that expired in January 2003. She understands that the best way to transfer her \nownership share is to renew her Russian internal passport, and she must be in Russia to \nrenew it. The Russian internal passport is the primary form of identification for Russian \ncitizens in Russia. It expired when she turned age 45 in 2016. Applicant\u2019s spouse has no \nother financial assets in Russia. (AE A; Tr. 78-82, 86, 92-99, 108-110, 51, 157-160.) Her \nRussian passport for international travel bears an old address in Russia. She has not \nmade any effort to update her residency information with Russian authorities. She does \nnot believe that she has any requirement to notify the Russian Embassy. (Tr. 110-111.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has a \u201cpretty good relationship\u201d with her mother. They \nexchange messages almost daily, usually about her mother\u2019s activities. Her mother has \nhad no difficulty obtaining and renewing a visa for travel to the United States. She has \nvisited Applicant and her daughter several times in the United States. She came to the \nUnited States most recently in December 2017 and stayed in Applicant\u2019s home for a \ncouple of months. (Tr. 76-77, 140, 152-153.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s contact with her father, who speaks English, has never been \nthat frequent, and it has lessened over the years as she moved away. After her father\u2019s \nsecond wife died, Applicant\u2019s spouse called her father two or three times a year. She \ncalled her father only once in 2017. He does not contact her. He is a mathematics \nprofessor at a state-owned university in Russia. Her father publishes internationally in \nEnglish and attends conferences abroad. To Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s knowledge, her father \nis unaware of Applicant\u2019s employment with a defense contractor. Applicant has had in-\nperson contact with his father-in-law and spouse\u2019s half-brother on one occasion, at the \nwedding party in Russia in April 2016. (AE H; Tr. 50, 71-74, 99-102, 107.) \n \n                                                 \n7As of March 2018, the U.S. State Department reported that Russian citizens who are legal permanent \nresidents of the United States must register their foreign residency with Russian authorities. See \nwww.state.gov.  \n\n \n \n8 \nApplicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s twin sister has lived in the United States since 2008. She has \nRussian citizenship but U.S. permanent residency with no conditions. She is married to a \nU.S. native citizen, who is a Vietnam veteran and works as a computer programmer. She \nhas a 10-year-old son who is a U.S. citizen. Applicant\u2019s spouse contacts her twin sister \non a regular basis. Her sister does not work outside the home. Applicant and his spouse \nhave visited her sister, but she has not visited them in their home. To Applicant\u2019s \nknowledge, his sister-in-law is the only one of her spouse\u2019s relatives who knows that he \nhas applied for security clearance eligibility. (Tr. 83-84, 103, 153, 160-162.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has a good relationship with her much younger half-sister in \nRussia.8 They are in communication with each other once or twice a month. Her half-\nsister is unmarried but has a boyfriend. She speaks English. Applicant\u2019s spouse has a \nhalf-brother (her father\u2019s son from his second marriage) with whom she has contact twice \na year. She has had communication with her father through her half-brother, who also \nspeaks English. (Tr. 51-52, 85-87, 107.) \n \n Applicant acknowledges that he cannot rule out the possibility of him being \nimproperly approached for sensitive information in the future. He cites his intelligence, \npatriotism, and training, including on his reporting responsibilities, as evidence that he \ncan be counted on to fulfill the obligations of the secret clearance needed for his \nemployment. He recently completed refresher training about the behavioral indicators of \nsomeone who could be a potential threat to the United States. He does not discuss his \njob outside of the workplace. (Tr. 142-146.) He testified that he and his spouse are not a \nperfect couple in that they have their disagreements and struggle at times to blend their \ntwo cultures. (Tr. 164.) \n \nApplicant received good to excellent ratings in all categories of performance rated \nfor the period February 2017 through January 2018. (AE F.) Applicant\u2019s current salary is \n$120,400 annually. His net worth in the United States is approximately $400,000. \nApplicant estimated that his spouse\u2019s apartment in Russia was worth $50,000 as of May \n2018. (Tr. 158-159.) \n \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nRussia is a highly centralized, authoritarian political system dominated by \nPresident Vladimir Putin. Its bicameral federal assembly lacks independence from the \nexecutive branch. The United States and Russia established diplomatic relations in \nDecember 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The United States has long \nsought a full and constructive relationship with Russia and supported Russia\u2019s integration \ninto European and global institutions and a deepened bilateral partnership in security \ncooperation to reinforce stability and predictability. In response to Russia violating \nUkraine\u2019s sovereignty in 2014, the United States downgraded the bilateral political and \nmilitary relationship and suspended most bilateral engagement with Russia on economic \n                                                 \n8 Applicant\u2019s spouse testified that her half-sister was born in 1989 and is closer in age to her daughter. (Tr. \n85.) Applicant gave a birth year of 1980 on his SF 86 for his spouse\u2019s half-sister. \n \n\n \n \n9 \nissues. In addition to ongoing Russian aggression in Georgia and Ukraine, Russia is \nengaged in a campaign to undermine core Western institutions, such as NATO and the \nEuropean Union to weaken faith in the democratic and free-market system. There is \ncurrently a low level of trust between the United States and Russia.9 \n \n \nIn December 2014, Russia\u2019s Supreme Court issued a ruling recognizing the \nIslamic Group of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, aka ISIS) as a terrorist organization and \nbanning its domestic activity. In response to Russia instituting military operations in Syria \nin September 2015, ISIL and affiliated terrorist organizations have vowed retaliatory \nterrorist attacks in Russia. In response, Russian security services enhanced security \nmeasures at many public venues in Russia, including tourist sites. In October 2015, a \nRussian charter plane exploded in mid-air over Egypt due to an improvised explosive \ndevice attributed to a terrorist act. The Russian Federation continued to remain a target \nof international terrorist groups in 2016. As of February 2017, the U.S. State Department \nassessed Moscow as being a critical-threat location for crime and a high-threat location \nfor terrorist activity directed at or affecting official U.S. government interests. \n \n \nSerious human rights abuses persisted in Russia in 2016 and 2017 as Russia \ncontinues to train and equip pro-Russian forces in regions of eastern Ukraine since the \noccupation and \u201cannexation\u201d of Crimea in March 2014.10 The United States considers \nRussia\u2019s actions in Crimea to be unlawful and in violation of Ukrainian and international \nlaw, and, in July 2018, called on Russia to end its occupation of Crimea. In 2016 and \n2017, Russian authorities conducted politically motivated arrests, detentions, and trials of \nUkrainian citizens in Russia. Russian authorities continued to restrict the ability of \nRussia\u2019s citizens to choose their government through free and fair elections and to \nexercise freedoms of expression, assembly, association, and movement. The \ngovernment selectively employed repressive laws to harass, discredit, prosecute, \nimprison, detain, fine, and suppress individuals and organizations critical of the \ngovernment. Other human rights problems included discrimination against minorities and \npersons with disabilities; allegations of torture and excessive force by law enforcement; \nsubstandard prison conditions; pressure on the judiciary by the executive branch; lack of \ndue process; extensive official corruption; violence against women; and trafficking in \npersons. \n \n \nRussia has a history of espionage against the United States. In July 2010, ten \nindividuals, nine of whom admitted to being Russian citizens, were expelled from the \nUnited States after pleading guilty to conspiring to serve as unlawful agents of the Russian \ngovernment within the United States. In January 2011, a former employee of the Central \nIntelligence Agency serving a prison sentence for a 1997 espionage conviction was \nsentenced to eight more years for passing information to Russia and receiving cash \npayments from agents of Russia through his son from 2006 to December 2008.

He conspired with a trade representative of the Russian \ngovernment in New York from 2010 to 2014 and with an attach\u00e9 to Russia\u2019s Permanent \nMission to the United Nations from 2012 to 2013. In July 2016, a dual citizen of the United \nStates and Russia was sentenced to ten years in prison for acting as an unregistered \nRussian government agent and leading a scheme to illegally export controlled \nmicroelectronics technology with military applications to Russia.  \n \nRussian civilian and military intelligence services have been implicated in a \ndecade-long campaign of cyber operations directed at the U.S. government and its \ncitizens, which include spear-phishing campaigns targeting government organizations, \ncritical infrastructure, think tanks, universities, political organizations, and corporations; \ntheft of information; and public release of some of this information. Russia has recently \nassumed a more assertive cyber posture based on its willingness to target critical \ninfrastructure systems and conduct espionage operations. The U.S. intelligence \ncommunity is confident that the Russian government attempted to interfere with the U.S. \npresidential election in 2016 and directed the hacking of emails of U.S. political \norganizations and disclosure on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks. In December \n2016, the U.S. State Department declared persona non grata 35 Russian officials \noperating in the United States who were acting in a manner inconsistent with their \ndiplomatic or consular status. This action was taken in response to Russia\u2019s interference \nin the U.S. election and a pattern of increased harassment of U.S. diplomats overseas \nover the past four years, including a significant increase in the last 12 months. The \nharassment involved arbitrary police stops, physical assault, and the broadcast on state \ntelevision in Russia of personal details about U.S. personnel that put them at risk. The \nU.S. intelligence community believes Russia will remain a major threat to U.S. \ngovernment, military, diplomatic, commercial, and critical infrastructure. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n\n \n \n11 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is articulated in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that \nis inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse is a Russian citizen, who immigrated to the United States in \nOctober 2015 on a fianc\u00e9e visa sponsored by Applicant. Her U.S. conditional residency \nstatus was renewed for one year in January 2018 while the United States considers her \n\n \n \n12 \npetition to remove the conditions on her U.S. permanent residency. She has a close and \ncontinuing relationship with her daughter, who is a Russian resident citizen employed at \nan elementary school. She and her daughter co-own the apartment in which her daughter \nresides with her boyfriend in Russia. Her twin sister is a Russian citizen, who has resided \nin the United States since 2008 and has U.S. permanent residency. Her mother is a \nRussian resident citizen, who is retired and has visited her and Applicant in the United \nStates on several occasions, most recently from December 2017 to approximately \nFebruary 2018. Her father is a Russian resident citizen employed as a mathematics \nprofessor at a Russian university. She has a half-sister from her mother\u2019s third marriage, \nwho is also a native Russian citizen, and close in age to her daughter.  \n \n  Review of Applicant\u2019s contacts and connections to these foreign citizens through \nmarriage is warranted to determine whether they present a heightened risk under AG \u00b6 \n7(a) or AG \u00b6 7(e) or create a potential conflict of interest under AG \u00b6 7(b). Those \ndisqualifying conditions provide: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n \n(e) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nNot every foreign contact or tie presents the heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a). The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. The nature and strength of the family ties or \nother foreign interests and the country involved (i.e., the nature of its government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human rights record) are relevant in assessing \nwhether there is a likelihood of vulnerability to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment; a family member is associated with, or dependent on, the foreign \ngovernment; or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United \nStates. In considering the nature of the foreign government, the administrative judge must \ntake into account any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case \nNo. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). \n \nApplicant has bonds of affection and obligation to his spouse, who, because of her \nRussian citizenship, is required by Russia to enter and exit the country on a Russian \n\n \n \n13 \npassport. Her U.S. residency gives her some protections when she is in the United States, \nbut the risk is heightened when she is in Russia to visit her family. When in Russia, she \nis fully accountable to Russian authorities for all obligations of a Russian citizen, and she \nplans to renew her Russian internal passport to transfer her share of the property co-\nowned with her daughter. \n \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, the immediate family members of his or her spouse. See e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 11-12659 (App. Bd. May 30, 2013). Applicant has had limited in-person contact with \nhis spouse\u2019s daughter, which was only during his trips to Russia in October 2014 and \nApril 2016. However, he maintains weekly contact by social media with her, despite the \nlanguage barrier. He provided her some financial support in 2015, although not in an \namount likely to raise the attention of Russian authorities. His spouse has an \nunderstandably very close relationship with her daughter, whom she contacts every day. \nHer daughter has tried and failed several times to obtain a visa to travel to the United \nStates to visit her mother. Applicant\u2019s spouse believes that her daughter\u2019s age and risk \nthat she would remain in the United States are the reasons for the visa denials, although \nthe evidentiary record does not include any U.S. government documentation explaining \nthe denials. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law had no trouble obtaining a visa, and she visited Applicant \nand his spouse in the United States several times, including as recently as December \n2017 to approximately February 2018. Applicant\u2019s spouse messages her mother almost \ndaily. Applicant\u2019s spouse also has a close relationship with her twin sister in the United \nStates. Her sibling enjoys the protections of U.S. permanent residency when she is in the \nUnited States. She would have to comply with the obligations of her Russian citizenship \nwhen in Russia, but it is unclear whether she has any travel plans to Russia.   \n \nApplicant had in-person contact with his father-in-law only during the trip to Russia \nin April 2016. He has had similarly limited in-person contact with his spouse\u2019s half-sister. \nApplicant has no ongoing contact with his father-in-law. He has quarterly contact by social \nmedia with his spouse\u2019s half-sister, who has a good relationship with his spouse. Despite \nbeing hosted by this half-sister when in Russia in April 2016, Applicant is unaware of her \noccupation or employment. Applicant\u2019s spouse does not have a very close relationship \nwith her father. In recent years, she contacted him only two or three times a year. She \ntestified that she had contact with her father only one time in 2017. \n \nApplicant and his spouse have traveled to Russia to visit her family, and they are \nlikely to continue to do so to visit her daughter. They have travel plans for October 2018, \nand his spouse intends to renew her Russian internal passport when in Russia to facilitate \nthe transfer of her ownership share of the apartment to her daughter. \n \nWith its mixed human rights record, and political, economic and military rivalry with \nthe United States, it is conceivable that Russia would target any Russian citizen or former \ncitizen living in the United States in an attempt to gather valuable information from the \nUnited States. Russian intelligence operatives seek classified or economic information \n\n \n \n14 \nfrom U.S. businesses and/or government agencies. Applicant\u2019s foreign relationships and \ncontacts through his marriage are sufficiently close to create a heightened risk and a \npossible security concern about his desire to help these relatives living in Russia and/or \nhis spouse by providing classified information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) are established. \n \nApplicant and his spouse have sent her daughter monetary gifts since 2015, but \nthey are no longer sending her any financial support. Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s 40% share of \nthe apartment co-owned with her daughter in Russia triggers disqualifying condition AG \n\u00b6 7(f). At a current value of $50,000, his spouse\u2019s share would be only about $20,000. \nHowever, the property is clearly important to her daughter as a financial asset and \nbecause it is her residence. AG \u00b6 7(f) applies. It provides: \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence, or exploitation, or \npersonal conflict of interest. \n \nThe burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate the risk of undue foreign influence that \nexists because of his familial ties through marriage to Russia, a country known to target \nU.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information. AG \u00b6 8(a) provides for mitigation \nas follows: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply. Russia\u2019s long history of aggressive espionage from \nwithin and outside the United States targeting classified and sensitive military and \ntechnological information, and its recent cyber hacking of emails of U.S. citizens and \npolitical entities, increase the risk that Applicant could find himself in a position of having \nto choose between the interests of his foreign family members and the interests of the \nUnited States. There is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s family members in Russia \nare politically involved. Her father is a professor at a state-owned university, and her \ndaughter works at a government-owned elementary school. There is little risk that her \ndaughter\u2019s work with children would be of interest to the Russian government, military, \nsecurity, or intelligence services. There is no evidence that her father has any connection \nto the Russian military. However, her father\u2019s academic position at a state-run Russian \nuniversity; his published work in theoretical mathematics; and his attendance at \ninternational academic conferences are factors that could raise the attention of Russian \nauthorities. \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has any loyalty or affiliation to Russia or its \ninstitutions, but it is difficult to conclude that the bonds of affection and obligation to his \n\n \n \n15 \nspouse and her immediate family members, including her only child and her mother, are \nso minimal to satisfy the first part of AG \u00b6 8(b), which provides: \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationships and loyalties in the United States may still be so deep and \nlongstanding that he can be counted on to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. interest. \nIn that regard, he is a native U.S. citizen who served honorably on active duty in the U.S. \nmilitary, albeit over 30 years ago now. While he enjoys travel and adventure, the U.S. has \nbeen his home. He raised four children, all native U.S. citizens, during his first marriage. \nHe has owned his current residence since October 1990 and has had a stable career in \nthe United States with a succession of employers. He has no foreign assets. His spouse \nintends to reside permanently in the United States, and as evidence of her intention in \nthat regard, she applied to renew the conditions on her U.S. permanent residency. Yet, it \nis also clear that Applicant and his spouse are likely to continue to have strong ties to her \ndaughter, who intends to reside permanently in Russia and has already been repeatedly \ndenied a tourist visa to come to the United States for reasons that are not clearly apparent \nin the record. Conceivably, Russian authorities could bring some pressure on his \nspouse\u2019s family members to gain influence or information from Applicant. People act in \nunpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a family \nmember.11 \n \nThere is nothing untoward about Applicant\u2019s relationships and contacts with his \nspouse\u2019s family members in Russia. He has no ongoing contact with his spouse\u2019s father. \nAG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that \nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d has \nlimited applicability nonetheless, given the close bonds of affection and regular contact \nthat Applicant\u2019s spouse has with her daughter and mother.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f), \u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used \neffectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual,\u201d warrants some \nconsideration. The apartment that Applicant\u2019s spouse co-owns is not of significant \nfinancial value to Applicant. It is routine in nature. However, to facilitate transfer of her \nownership share of the asset to her daughter, Applicant\u2019s spouse intends to renew her \nRussian internal passport when she is next in Russia. It could generate some inquiry by \nRussian authorities about her marital status and residency. The foreign influence security \nconcerns are not fully mitigated.  \n                                                 \n11 As stated by the DOHA Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 08-10025 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009), \u201cApplication \nof the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people \nmay act in unpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a loved-one, such as a \nfamily member.\u201d \n\n \n \n16 \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d).12 Furthermore, in weighing these whole-person factors in a foreign influence case, \nthe Appeal Board has held that: \n \nEvidence of good character and personal integrity is relevant and material \nunder the whole person concept. However, a finding that an applicant \npossesses good character and integrity does not preclude the government \nfrom considering whether the applicant's facts and circumstances still pose \na security risk. Stated otherwise, the government need not prove that an \napplicant is a bad person before it can deny or revoke access to classified \ninformation. Even good people can pose a security risk because of facts \nand circumstances not under their control. See ISCR Case No. 01-26893 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002). \n \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s spouse is employed in the United States, and she intends to \nreside here permanently, she has lived in the United States only since 2015. She has \nstrong family, legal, and cultural ties to her native Russia. Applicant could be placed in an \nuntenable situation of having to choose between the interests of his spouse or her family \nmembers and those of the United States. Perhaps at some future date, Applicant\u2019s family \nsituation may present less of a risk. At this time, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant security clearance eligibility for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n                                                 \n12 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(a) are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n\n \n \n17 \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n________________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.b alleged the same facts under the personal conduct guideline (\u00b6 1.a), and under the financial considerations guideline (\u00b6 2.a cross-alleged \u00b6 1.a). After a thorough review of the record evidence, including his testimony and demeanor while testifying, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 42-year-old information technology auditor working with a federal contractor. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2000 and a master\u2019s degree in 2001, both in accounting and information systems. He married his spouse in 2004, and they have three children, ages 11, 9, and 6. Applicant started working for federal contractors immediately after receiving his bachelor\u2019s degree. He worked for his first employer between 2001 and February 2016. He has held a top-secret clearance continuously since 2003. In February 2016, Applicant\u2019s current employer, a federal contractor, hired him. There is no evidence of any security violations, except for the two SOR allegations. In his October 2016 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he was denied eligibility for access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) by another federal agency (Agency) in December 2015.

Schachter, Esq. \n__________ \nDecision \n__________ \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not deliberately falsify the hours he worked. He was sloppy in his \ntimekeeping practices and he has acknowledged his mistakes. He has taken corrective \naction, and credibly promised to properly report his work hours. He has established a \nstrong professional reputation that weighs in his favor. He was candid and forthcoming \nduring the clearance process. Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted his most recent security clearance application (SCA) on \nOctober 10, 2016, seeking to continue the clearance he has held since about 2001. \nAfter reviewing the information gathered during the background investigation, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) issued him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on December \n21, 2017, alleging security concerns under Guideline E (personal conduct) and \nGuideline F (financial considerations). Applicant answered the SOR on January 22, \n2018, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).  \nDOHA assigned the case to me on July 20, 2018, and issued a notice of hearing \non November 5, 2018, setting the hearing for December 13, 2018. At the hearing, the \n03/07/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nGovernment offered three exhibits (GE 1 through 3).

There is no evidence of \nany security violations, except for the two SOR allegations. \n \nIn his October 2016 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he was denied eligibility for \naccess to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) by another federal agency \n(Agency) in December 2015. Applicant\u2019s background investigation addressed the denial \nof his SCI eligibility that is documented in the Agency\u2019s Clearance Decision Statement \n(CDS; GE 2). \n \nThe CDS was based on statements made by Applicant during a polygraph \nassisted interview in June 2015. In its pertinent parts, the summary of the interview \nprepared by the Agency interviewer states: \n \nApplicant stated that he does not document his [work] time in an accurate \nmanner. He rounds off time because he is \u201cso busy,\u201d and he felt like he \nnever has the time to accurately document the amount of time he works \non each contract since he began his employment . . . I just don\u2019t have the \ntime to do that [accurately document time]. I just don\u2019t care, and should I \nbe more accurate . . . yeah, probably. \n \nFor example, he might work 30 minutes on a contract and document that \nhe worked one hour. He stated that he has worked one hour and \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndocumented two-and-a-half hours because his expertise oftentimes allows \nto complete a task much more quickly than someone else would have \nbeen able to do the same thing. [Applicant] has also documented time \nworked when he is taking a lunch break . . . . approximately once or twice \nper week, with the last time being the Monday prior to his interview . . . . \nHe stated he attempts to document his hours more carefully if he is \nworking on time and materials contracts . . . . because the government \nwould be billed according to the amount of hours worked; however, he is \nmore \u201cverbose,\u201d or less careful with the fixed-price contracts because he is \njudged by customers based on his outcome, and is awarded contracts \nbased on his numbers. He is only benefiting internally because his hours \nare collected for internal reporting matrices only . . . . \n \nApplicant repeatedly denied that he deliberately cheated on his time cards or that \nhe deliberately falsified the number of hours he worked. He believes that he reported his \nhours in good faith and in accordance with government and his company\u2019s standards. \nHe averred that his statements to the Agency investigator were reported out of context. \nHe attributed his sloppy timekeeping to his very busy schedule and not having the right \ntools to do the timekeeping. \n \nThe chief operating officer (COO) for Applicant\u2019s current company testified on his \nbehalf. The COO is the person who recruited and hired Applicant in 2016. He was \nrecruited because of his outstanding reputation. Applicant is now a partner in the \ncompany. In the COO\u2019s opinion, Applicant has an impeccable record and a great \nreputation for his trustworthiness, honesty, and reliability. Applicant\u2019s reputation stands \nby itself within the marketplace; he is considered to be an honorable and dependable \nman. Since he was hired in 2016, Applicant\u2019s performance has been stellar and superb. \nHe follows the letter of the law and provides leadership and oversight to a diverse team \nof employees. Applicant made the COO aware of the SOR and its allegations. The COO \nbelieves that the concerns are the result of miscommunications and that the allegations \ndo not reflect on Applicant\u2019s integrity. He strongly recommends the continuation of his \nclearance. Applicant is a great father and is involved in his children\u2019s sporting events. \n(Tr. 30-33, AE B) \n \nTwo executive vice presidents, a vice president, and a senior partner of \nApplicant\u2019s company all echoed the above glowing remarks about Applicant\u2019s character, \nperformance, and willingness to comply with rules and regulations. They strongly \nrecommend the continuation of his clearance. \n \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s second witness (P), Applicant\u2019s prior employer (at the \ntime of the allegations) conducted annual training to teach employees how to record \ntime worked. The time was supposed to be charged on a daily basis, but never later \nthan by mid-day the next working day. There was no time punching, and it was up to the \nindividuals to have their own time tracking mechanisms. All time sheets were approved \nby the individual\u2019s supervisors. In the case of time and materials contracts with the \ngovernment, the time sheets were also reviewed by government officials. P has never \n\n \n4 \n \n \nhad a reason to question Applicant\u2019s honesty, integrity, ethics, or trustworthiness. P was \nin charge of monitoring the time charged to clients in different projects. During the four \nyears that he monitored Applicant\u2019s time sheets, he never noticed any issues or \ndiscrepancies with the time he charged to government clients. \n \nA third reference noted that he was in charge of reviewing all charged hours and \nbudgets that Applicant had documented for his clients during the period between 2012 \nand 2016. He reviewed the charged hours for appropriateness and could not identify \nany instances where Applicant falsified any hours he worked. The reference considers \nApplicant to be the perfect example of a true professional, always leading by example, \nand well-liked by peers and clients alike. He considers Applicant to be trustworthy, \nhonest, reliable, and a law-abiding person who follows rules and regulations. He \nendorsed Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance. \n \nApplicant\u2019s first employer is a well-known large accounting firm. Because of his \ngood performance, between 2001 and 2016, Applicant was promoted quickly and \nachieved a managing director position before he was recruited by his current employer. \nThe time worked was reported in 15 minute increments, wherein any work less than 15 \nminutes was reported as 15 minutes of work. \n \nApplicant claimed that he did not have a tool to help him remember the time he \nworked in a particular contract during the day, and his time reporting was complicated \nbecause he would have six or more clients he would work with during any particular \nday. He would use his email, calendar, meeting requests, and other documents to \nrecreate his time reporting. Applicant admitted that he sometimes would round up his \nhours or sometimes he would guess the time worked on a client because of his poor \ntime keeping habits. \n \nA supervisor always had to review and approve Applicant\u2019s time sheets. He was \nmore careful when dealing in time and materials contracts because there was an \nadditional level of review by a government agent that would review and approve the \ninvoices submitted. He denied ever rounding up or guessing any work-time for time and \nmaterials contracts because he was more careful recording his time with those \ncontracts. \n \nApplicant did not recall telling the Agency interviewer that he did not care about \naccurately keeping his time. He admitted that he told the interviewer that he was much \nmore careful recording his time for time and materials contracts because they directly \nimpacted the government billings. Applicant admitted to documenting time work during a \nlunch break once or twice a week. He explained that it was regular practice to have \nworking lunches to discuss client related issues, training, new business opportunities, or \nto answer a client\u2019s call. He claimed he only billed for that part of his lunch time where \nhe was working. \n \nApplicant also denied telling the interviewer that he would work only 30 minutes \nand round up his time to charge one full hour on a particular contract. He claimed he \n\n \n5 \n \n \nwas talking to the interviewer about charging for training time or other administrative \nfunctions, but not contracts. He explained that if he was able to complete the training in \ntwo hours because of his experience, but the average employee would take three hours \nto complete the training, he would also charge the three hours.  \n \nApplicant noted that his timekeeping practices, time sheets, or invoices had \nnever been challenged or questioned by any of his supervisors, customers, or clients \nthroughout his career. After the Agency interviews in 2015, he completely changed his \npractice of documenting his time - he stopped rounding off worked hours and he \nstopped guessing the hours worked. In 2018, Applicant took a one-day government \ntimekeeping class at a university to ensure his timekeeping practices were according to \ngovernment standards. Since implementing his new practices, he believes he is now \nmore meticulous and accurate in his time keeping. \n \nApplicant believes that he has learned a difficult lesson as a result of the Agency \ninterviews and the concerns raised by his past timekeeping practices. He credibly stated \nthat he takes these concerns very seriously because this is his career. Applicant noted \nthat even after the Agency\u2019s interviews, there was never an investigation opened \nagainst him concerning his timekeeping practices by any of his employers, nor were \nthere any complaints filed by his customers, or by the government. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the  Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG), implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 2. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch \nin regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 sets forth the security concern as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information . . . .  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified the number of hours he \nworked between 2001 and 2015. Applicant admitted that he sometimes rounded off the \nhours he worked and that sometimes he guessed the time he charged any particular \nclient. However, he repeatedly denied that he deliberately falsified or misrepresented \nthe number of hours he worked. \n \n \nIf true, Applicant\u2019s behavior would raise the following disqualifying conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, \nbut \nwhich, \nwhen \ncombined \nwith \nall \navailable \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness \nto comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthat the individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach \nof client confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized \nrelease \nof \nsensitive \ncorporate \nor \ngovernment protected information; \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources; deliberately providing false \nor misleading information; or concealing or omitting \ninformation, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental \nhealth professional involved in making a recommendation \nrelevant to a national security eligibility determination, or \nother official government representative; \n \n \nThe record does not establish the above disqualifying condition. But even if it did, \nI would consider it mitigated under the following mitigating conditions set forth by AG \u00b6 \n17: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated of from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \n \nApplicant repeatedly denied that he deliberately falsified or misrepresented the \nhours he worked. He admitted that he sometimes rounded off his hours, and that \nsometimes he guessed the time he charged to any particular client or contract. He \nattributed his sloppy timekeeping to his very busy schedule and not having the right \ntools to do the timekeeping. Applicant credibly testified that most of his negligent \ntimekeeping was done while working on fixed-price contracts or reporting training or \n\n \n8 \n \n \nother administrative functions. He specifically noted that he was more careful with his \ntimekeeping while working on time and materials contracts because he did not want to \novercharge the client, and he knew there was more timekeeping oversight by his \nemployer and the government on those contracts.  \n \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, I find that Applicant did not deliberately \nfalsify the number of hours he worked. His actions were more likely the result of \nnegligent or sloppy timekeeping practices. I do not find that he had the deliberate intent \nto deceive or misrepresent information to the government or his employer. Applicant \nhas consistently received positive performance feedback. Since 2001, he has built a \nstrong professional reputation. He is generally known by his coworkers, supervisors, \nand clients for his professional skills, dedication, honesty, reliability, and dependability. I \nnote that even after concerns were raised about his timekeeping practices, there were \nno investigations, complaints, or disciplinary actions taken against Applicant or his then \nemployer for improper timekeeping practices in government contracts.  \n \n \nApplicant has held a clearance since about 2001, with no issues or security \nconcerns, except for the current SOR allegations. He has been forthcoming during the \nsecurity clearance process. He disclosed the Agency\u2019s denial of his SCI eligibility in his \n2016 SCA, and he was candid and forthcoming at his hearing. Applicant acknowledged \nhis timekeeping mistakes and credibly promised not to repeat his questionable \nbehavior. He participated in a government timekeeping class, and seems to be \ngenuinely remorseful for his past negligent practices. I find that Applicant is unlikely to \ncontinue his negligent or sloppy timekeeping practices. It has been over three years \nsince Applicant was confronted with his poor timekeeping practices during the Agency \ninterviews. There is no evidence of any additional questionable behavior or timekeeping \npractices. Applicant\u2019s past timekeeping practice do not cast doubt in his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR cross-alleges in \u00b6 2.a the same factual concerns \nalleged in \u00b6 1.a. Because those concerns were fully addressed under Guideline E, for \n\n \n9 \n \n \nthe sake of brevity my findings, analysis, and conclusions under those guidelines will be \nincorporated herein without repeating them. \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified the number of hours he \nworked between 2001 and 2015. Applicant admitted that he sometimes rounded off the \nhours he worked and that sometimes he guessed the time he charged any particular \nclient or contract. He denied that he deliberately falsified or misrepresented the number \nof hours he worked. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides a disqualifying condition that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as \nembezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, \nfiling deceptive loan statements and other intentional breaches of trust.\u201d  \n \nConsistent with my findings and conclusion under Guideline E, incorporated \nherein, I find that the record does not establish the above disqualifying condition. Even if \nthe above disqualifying condition was raised by the facts of the case, I find it mitigated \nunder the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control. \n \n \nI find that Applicant is unlikely to continue his negligent or sloppy timekeeping \npractices. It has been over three years since Applicant was confronted with his poor \ntimekeeping practices during the Agency interviews. There is no evidence of any \nadditional questionable behavior of security concerns, or of continuing bad timekeeping \npractices. Applicant\u2019s past timekeeping practices do not cast doubt in his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for \nfederal contractors since 2001, and has held a clearance during employment without \nany issues or concerns, except for SOR current allegations.  \n \nApplicant has established a strong professional reputation. He is generally known \nby his coworkers, supervisors, and clients for his professional skills, dedication, \nhonesty, reliability, and dependability. His excellent reputation weights in his favor. \nApplicant is fully aware of the security concerns raised by his negligent or poor \ntimekeeping practices. He credibly promised to maintain proper timekeeping practices \nto avoid any future concerns. The personal conduct and financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n  \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest of the United States to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance to Applicant. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 15, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on July 5, 2018. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on that \nsame day, scheduling the hearing for August 1, 2018. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 5, which were admitted \ninto evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf, but presented no documentation. \nThe record was left open until October 3, 2018, for receipt of additional documentation. \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant submitted nothing. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on \nAugust 9, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to all the allegations of the SOR, except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.e., \n1.f., 1.i., 1.l., and 1.q.

(TR at page 18 line 11 to page 20 line 11.) Despite having two \nmonths to do so, Applicant has submitted nothing further in this regard. This allegation \nis found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.b. Applicant denies that he has an outstanding judgment to Creditor B in the \namount of about $1,828. (TR at page 20 line 12 to page 21 line 9.) As this outstanding \njudgment appears on the Government\u2019s February 2016 credit report (CR); and as \nApplicant has submitted nothing further in this regard, this allegation is found against \nApplicant. (GX 3 at page 3.) \n \n \n1.c. Applicant admits that he has a past-due debt to Creditor C in the amount of \nabout $395. (TR at page 21 line 10 to page 22 line 6.) As he has submitted nothing \nfurther in this regard, this allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.d. Applicant admits that he has past-due child support payments totaling about \n$12,436. He avers that he is paying about $120 each month by way of garnishment to \naddress this admitted debt. (TR at page 22 line 8 to page 24 line 12.) As Applicant has \nsubmitted nothing further in this regard, this allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.e.  Applicant denies that he has a past-due debt to Creditor E in the amount of \nabout $7,202. (TR at page 24 line 13 to page 25 line 7, and at page 25 line 24 to page \n26 line 7.)

As he has submitted nothing \nfurther in this regard, these allegations are found against Applicant. \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \n\n \n4 \n \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n  \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has a long history of \ndelinquencies. His past-due indebtedness totals about $130,000. He has not \ndemonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has \nnot been established. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant his eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.t.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

I was assigned this case on July 20, 2018. On \nAugust 8, 2018, a notice was issued setting the hearing for September 26, 2018. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled.  \nThe Government offered two documents, which were accepted into the record \nwithout objection as Government exhibits (Exs.) 1-2. Applicant gave testimony and \noffered five documents, which were accepted into the record without objection as Exs. \nA-E. A transcript (Tr.) of the proceedings was received on October 4, 2018, and the\nrecord was closed. After my review of the record as a whole, I find that Applicant\nmitigated foreign influence security concerns.\n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017.  \n03/28/2019\n\n \n \n2 \n \n  Request for Administrative Notice  \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a written request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts about the Philippines. The request was offered as Government Ex. 2. \nApplicant did not object. I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in the \nrequest that are supported by source documents from official U.S. Government \npublications, and from other recent DOHA decisions. The facts considered include, but \nare not limited to, the following: \n \n\u2022 The Philippines is a multi-party, constitutional republic with a bicameral \nlegislature. The United States recognized the Philippines as an independent state and \nestablished diplomatic relations in 1946. The United States has designated the \nPhilippines as a major non-NATO ally, and there are close and abiding security ties \nbetween the two nations, based on strong historical and cultural links and a shared \ncommitment to democracy and human rights. The Manila Declaration of 2011 reaffirmed \nthe 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty as the foundation for a robust, \nbalanced, and responsive security partnership.  \n \n\u2022 The United States is among the Philippines\u2019 top trading partners, and it \ntraditionally has been the Philippines\u2019 largest foreign investor. The United States and \nthe Philippines have a bilateral trade and investment framework and a tax treaty. \nPhilippine imports from the United States include raw and semi-processed materials for \nthe manufacture of semiconductors, electronics and electrical machinery, transport \nequipment, cereals, and cereal preparations. \n \n\u2022 Philippine national elections have been generally free and fair, but independent \nobservers have noted widespread vote buying. In addition, dynastic political families \nhave monopolized elective offices at the national and local level.  \n \n\u2022 The most significant human rights problems are extrajudicial killings, enforced \ndisappearances undertaken by security forces and vigilante groups, a weak and \noverburdened criminal justice system, widespread official corruption and abuse of \npower, and impunity from prosecution for human rights abuses.  \n \n\u2022 Other human rights problems include prisoner and detainee torture and abuse \nby security forces, violence and harassment against human rights activists by security \nforces, warrantless arrests, lengthy pretrial detentions, poor prison conditions, violence \nagainst women, abuse and sexual exploitation of children, and trafficking in persons.  \n \n\u2022 Muslim separatists, communist insurgencies, and terrorist organizations are \nactive in the Philippines, and they have killed Philippine security forces, local \ngovernment officials, and other civilians. Through joint U.S. - Philippine cooperation, the \nability of these various groups to operate in the Philippines has been heavily \nconstrained, but not eliminated. In 2014, there were numerous attacks with small arms \nand improvised explosive devices, kidnappings for ransom, and extortion efforts by \nsuspected terrorist groups. Gangs of kidnappers have targeted tourists and foreigners, \nincluding Filipino-Americans. The U.S. State Department has recommended that all \nU.S. citizens defer non-essential travel to the Sulu Archipelago due to the high threat of \n\n \n \n3 \n \nkidnapping in that area. The State Department also has warned U.S. citizens to \nexercise extreme caution if traveling to the island of Mindanao due to violent activities of \nterrorist and insurgent groups.  \n \n\u2022 The Philippine government has recognized the potential threat posed by \nradicalized citizens supporting e Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). In July \n2014, the Philippine president\u2019s anti-terrorism council convened an ad hoc emergency \ntechnical working group focusing on persons of interest. The working group has \ntightened passport issuance, increased immigration screening, and increased \nmonitoring of ISIL-related activity. \n \n \u2022 The source documents submitted do not establish that the Philippines engages \nin economic or military intelligence activity against the United States. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old architect who has worked for the same employer, a \ndefense contractor, for about two years. He specializes in architecture and urban \nplanning. He has earned two bachelor\u2019s degrees and a master\u2019s degree. Born in the \nUnited States, he is married and has two minor children.  \n \n \nIn 2010, Applicant\u2019s father, a naturalized U.S. citizen, moved back to the \nPhilippines to care for his ailing mother, Applicant\u2019s grandmother. Applicant\u2019s father \nbought a condominium in the Philippines after the move, and also had his name put on \nproperty owned by his own parents before they died. (Tr. 18)  He did so to facilitate its \ntransfer upon the death of Applicant\u2019s grandparents. More recently, Applicant\u2019s father \nhas decided to retire primarily in the Philippines in order to be close to family.2 (Tr. 20) \nApplicant testified that his father subsequently decided to have Applicant put his name \non the properties because: \n \nIn the Philippines, if you try to inherit property . . . it\u2019s darn near \nimpossible. Pretty much the government will take most if not all of it \nthrough inheritance. The typical way people go and inherit property is by \ntransfer and/or by putting a second name on the deed title. And the only \nway you\u2019re allowed to have our [sic] name on a deed title in the Philippines \nis if you were also a Filipino citizen. The Philippines does not allow foreign \nnationals to go and own property in the Philippines . . . .  (Tr. 19) \n \nFirst, however, Applicant had to become a citizen of the Philippines.  \n \nApplicant learned that as a child of two native-born Philippine citizens, he could \napply for retroactive recognition of Philippine citizenship, which in his case would mean \n                                                          \n2 Applicant\u2019s father derives no medical, health, or retirement benefits from the Philippines. (Tr. 29) He \ndoes, however, receive a retirement pension and Social Security from the United States to supplement \nhis income in retirement. Applicant does not provide him with any financial assistance. \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \nrecognized dual-citizenship with the U.S. and the Philippines.3 He pursued this avenue \ndespite having \u201cno interest . . . I\u2019m doing this out of an abundance of respect for my \nfather. I see him very infrequently . . . maybe once a year. I might correspond with him \nvia email or a version of text message maybe a handful of times.\u201d (Tr. 20) Applicant\u2019s \nintention is to sell the property when his father passes away as he has no need for the \nproperty or its financial benefits. He noted, \u201cif I don\u2019t get a dime it will not bother me in \nthe slightest. . . . Whether I get any money for it doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d (Tr. 20-21, 40)  \n \nIn contrast to his potential future interest in the Philippines, Applicant was born, \nraised, and educated in the United States. He and his wife have built their home and are \nraising their family within their community, where they are highly involved in a variety of \ncapacities. (Tr. 23) The family is very involved with their church and its various \ncommittees. Currently a homemaker, Applicant\u2019s wife, a former professor, is an active \nvolunteer.4 She plans to continue in that capacity until her children are a little older. \nApplicant maintains close contact with his divorced mother and his in-laws, all of whom \nlive in the same region. He has worked for his current employer and several state and \nlocal governments over his career, earning him a solid professional reputation. The \nfamily is \u201cmore than comfortable without any other financial assistance.\u201d (Tr. 21)  \n \nApplicant maintains his checking, savings, and retirement accounts in the United \nStates. His personal retirement account amounts to about $200,000, he keeps about \n$10,000 in liquid assets, and their home is worth about $350,000. Both his children are \nenjoying the local public schools, where Applicant and his wife are active. The children \nare busy with multiple extracurricular and community activities. Applicant does not have \na valid Philippine passport, nor does he speak the Tagalog language. (Tr. 21, 41)   \n \nAt issue are three properties in the Philippines, noted in the SOR at 1.b-1.d The \nproperty at 1.b, in which Applicant\u2019s father resides, is jointly owned by Applicant\u2019s father, \nhalf-sister, and Applicant.5 Technically, the father is the primary owner with Applicant \nand his half-sister listed as secondary interests on the deed. Located in the vicinity of \nMetro Manila, this condominium is currently worth about $100,000.6 (Tr. 34) A parking \nspace for that unit is valued at about $7,000.  \n \nThe property at 1.c, which is located in the same region, is a condominium \ncurrently under construction. This smaller property, valued as potentially worth about \n$40,000, is similarly co-owned by Applicant\u2019s father, half-sister, and Applicant. An \nassociated parking place is valued at approximately $5,800. This property was \n                                                          \n3 Because the application for retroactive citizenship does not actually seek Philippine citizenship, but only \nthe acknowledgment that Applicant automatically became a Philippine citizen upon birth to two native \nPhilippine citizens, it does not constitute an application to become a Philippine citizen. (Tr. 31-32) \n \n4 No evidence was offered regarding Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s finances, savings, future interests, etc. \n \n5 Applicant\u2019s half-sister also has no interest in the properties at issue or relocating from the United States \nto the Philippines. Here, she has a family, children, and career. (Tr. 40) Should she later take an interest \nin one or more of the properties, Applicant will sign over his interests to her.  \n \n6 The Manila region is distant from the Sulu Archipelago and Mindanao, areas in which the U.S. State \nDepartment advises U.S. citizens to use particular caution. \n\n \n \n5 \n \npurchased during the pre-construction stage. Applicant\u2019s father intends to eventually sell \nhis current condominium and downsize into this property.   \n \nThe property at 1.d is a new residential apartment building consisting of 26 units \nand valued at about $400,000. The building is currently jointly owned in the same \nmanner as the other properties, with Applicant\u2019s father as primary owner. In about 2015, \nApplicant\u2019s grandparent\u2019s home and office was razed in order to build this structure. \nUnits are currently available for rent. (Tr. 39)  \n \nIn addition, Applicant is a signatory on his father\u2019s various savings accounts in \nthe Philippines. (Tr. 45) He was put on to these accounts to facilitate in their liquidation \nupon the father\u2019s death. (Tr. 42, 45-46) They make up his father\u2019s \u201cplay money,\u201d cash \nthe father uses to make investments on the stock market. (Tr. 42) Applicant believes it \namounts to about $50,000. These are distinctly different balances from the money \nApplicant\u2019s father maintains in U.S. banking institutions in this country. Applicant is not \nfully aware of his father\u2019s financial holdings in the United States. His father is 70 years \nold, a diabetic smoker with serious spinal issues.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s adjudicative goal is \na fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. Under the AG, the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the paramount \nconsideration. Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.  \n \nUnder the Directive, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \nwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \napplicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence that transcends beyond \nnormal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in \nthose to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include \nconsideration of the possible risk the applicant may fail to safeguard such information.  \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nUnder the AG, foreign contact and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they create \ncircumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign \nperson, group, organization, or government in a way inconsistent with U. S. interests or \notherwise be made vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. \nAssessment of foreign contact and interests should consider the country (Philippines) in \nwhich the foreign contact or interest is included.  \n \n \nThe AG lists nine available disqualifying conditions. Given that Applicant has a \nfather who is a dual-citizen of the U.S. and the Philippines who resides in the \nPhilippines most of the year, and because Applicant is a co-owner of properties and \nbank accounts held by his father in the Philippines, I find the following apply:  \n \n\u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country, if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;   \n \n\u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n\u00b6 7(f): substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflict of interest.   \n \nUnder \u00b6 8, three mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n  \n\u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n\u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n\u00b6 8(f): the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual.   \n \n \nAs a threshold issue, I note the information regarding the Philippines \nincorporated into this analysis above. Here, the Government is concerned with whether \nthere is a risk of exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion related to \nApplicant\u2019s father and the Philippine properties. (Tr. 47) Applicant\u2019s closeness to his \nfather is demonstrated by his going through the process to permit his name to be on the \nproperty deeds and bank accounts, something he did \u201cout of an abundance of respect\u201d \nfor his father. As a result, he and his half-sister have the potential of splitting about \n$552,000, or receiving about $276,000 each. In addition, should the funds and \ninvestments not be depleted, Applicant has the potential of inheriting about $50,000 in \nPhilippine held \u201cfun money.\u201d Consequently, Applicant clearly has a notable ($326,000) \nfinancial interest in the Philippines.   \n \n \nThe reason Applicant has gone through certain legal machinations in order to \nhave his name added to his father\u2019s properties and banks is related to problems \nconcerning inheritance in the Philippines. Applicant\u2019s testimony reflects that \nextraordinary efforts are taken in the law to keep such interests from being passed \ndown to one\u2019s heirs. Taken in conjunction with the country\u2019s reputation for vigorous \ntactics and circumventing due process, there is the potential concern as to how far it \nwould go to gain something it wants. Similarly, there are third-party forces and terrorist \ngroups within the Philippines known to kill and kidnap foreigners, a significant problem \nrecognized by the Philippine government as well. \n \n \nFacts exist, however, tending to mitigate the security concerns raised. Applicant \nwas born and raised in the United States. Here, he was educated, met his wife, and \nmarried. They have built their own home, had children, and become heavily involved \nwith their community, church, and school system. He considers the United States to be \nhis only home and he has no desire to move to the Philippines, where he does not \nspeak the language. Applicant has excelled in his profession within his region. He \nmaintains a close relationship with his mother and with his in-law here, as well. He has \npersonally made no financial investments abroad. Rather, in the United States, he has \nretirement savings of about $200,000, about $10,000 in liquid assets, and their home is \nvalued at about $350,000. Combined, this represents about $560,000 in current worth \nfor a man in his early 40s with considerable earning potential in his future, and with a \nwife who will inevitably return to the workforce. Applicant was credible in his \ndeclarations that he has no need for the potential inheritances at issue, and will liquidate \nany such inheritance received. I find \u00b6 8(a)-(b) and \u00b6 8(f) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed in the AG. The ultimate determination of whether \n\n \n \n8 \n \nto grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment \nbased upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I incorporated my comments under \nthe guideline at issue in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors related to the \nwhole person concept have already been discussed, but some warrant emphasis. \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old architect who has worked for the same employer for \nabout two years. He has made a successful career in his region working with \ngovernments and communities with regard to architecture and urban planning. He was \nborn, raised, and educated in this country. He and his wife have two children who are \nlikewise being raised and educated in the local schools. The family is enmeshed in their \ncommunity, busy with volunteerism, the schools, and church. Applicant\u2019s wife, a former \nprofessor, is a homemaker and volunteer at present, taking time from work until the \nchildren are a little older. They are happy and successful living their American dream.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father has returned to his birthplace, the Philippines, as a part-time \nresident. Because of restrictive and somewhat dubious inheritance laws, he had \nApplicant have his dual-nationality (U.S.-Philippines) recognized so he could have \nApplicant\u2019s name added to property titles along with his half-sister. Applicant has no \ninterest in either the properties or living in the Philippines. He went through these \nmachinations out of respect to his father, not for economic gain. Should he come into \nhis share of this property-based inheritance, he will either cash out of the investment or \ngive his half-sister his interest. He considers his father\u2019s \u201cfun money\u201d to be \ncomparatively de minimis. Applicant is a highly successful professional with markedly \nmore financial holdings in the United States. Taken together, Applicant\u2019s potential \ninheritance is unlikely to result in a conflict or be used effectively to influence, \nmanipulate, or pressure him, just as his longstanding loyalties to the United States \noutweigh his interests abroad. Therefore, I find Applicant has mitigated foreign influence \nsecurity concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                          \n      \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

His request for a security clearance is granted. \nStatement of Case \nOn September 26, 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application \n(SF 86). On March 5, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B for foreign influence. The SOR further informed Applicant \nthat, based on information available to the Government, DoD adjudicators could not \nmake the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n01/15/2019\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 5, 2018, and April 17, 2018 (Answer), and \nrequested that his case be decided by an administrative judge on the written record \nwithout a hearing. (Item 1.) On September 7, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s written case. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), \ncontaining six Items, was received by him on September 12, 2018. The FORM notified \nApplicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. On October 10, \n2018, he submitted an 11-page response to the FORM (Reply). He did not object to any \nof the Items. On January 8, 2019, the case was assigned to me. Items 1 through 6 and \nthe Reply are admitted into evidence, without objection.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nThe Government and Applicant both requested I take administrative notice of \ncertain facts relating to the Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran). Department Counsel provided \na seven-page summary of the facts, supported by 16 Government documents pertaining \nto Iran, marked as Item 6. The documents provide elaboration and context for the \nsummary. I take administrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. Government \nreports. They are limited to matters of general knowledge and not subject to reasonable \ndispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. The facts are as follows: \n \n \nApplicant is 27 years old. He is unmarried, and has a minor child. Applicant was \nborn in Iran and immigrated to the United States in 2006, at the age of 15. He graduated \nfrom a U.S. high school. He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in October 2011. He \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016 from a U.S. university. He has not visited Iran since \n2007.

Applicant\u2019s daughter is a natural born citizen of the United \nStates. (Answer; Item 4.) Applicant has no contact with his father or stepsisters, who are \ncitizens and residents of Iran, since 2007. Applicant indicated that \u201call of my family \nmembers including myself are strongly opposed to the Islamic government of Iran.\u201d \n(Reply.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a dual citizen of the United States and Iran. She immigrated \nto the United States with Applicant in 2006 and was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in \n2012. His mother travels to Iran annually to assist her ailing mother. Most recently, she \nresided in Iran for about a year between 2016 and 2017, and then returned to the \nUnited States. After his grandmother\u2019s impending passing, Applicant\u2019s mother will \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nremain wholly in the United States. Applicant has little contact with his mother when she \nis in Iran. He does not discuss the details of his job with her even when she is in the \nUnited States. (Item 4; Reply.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s maternal grandfather is deceased. Applicant\u2019s maternal grandmother \nremains a citizen and resident of Iran. She is 92 years old and was a homemaker. She \npreviously held legal permanent resident status in the United States, but has not been \nable to travel to the United States due to her health. She is in failing health and cannot \ntravel to the United States due to her condition. Applicant communicates with her a few \ntimes each year. (Item 4; Item 5; Reply.)  \n \n \nNone of Applicant\u2019s family members have ever been employed by a foreign \ngovernment or military. He has no foreign assets. Applicant\u2019s only foreign travel in the \npast ten years was for a vacation in Mexico. (Item 5.)  \n \n \nApplicant is considered an \u201cexemplary contributor as an engineer and innovator\u201d \nby his manager. He is considered to be among the best and brightest in his line of work \nand is a valuable asset to his employer. (Reply.) \n \nIran \n \n \nIran is an authoritarian state in which a theocratic religious scholar, the Supreme \nLeader, is accountable only to the Assembly of Experts, a popularly elected 86-member \nbody of clerics. Iran has been considered to be a State Sponsor of Terrorism by the \nUnited States since 1984. Iran provides financial aid, advanced weapons and tactics, \nand directions to militant and terrorist groups across the Middle East. Citizens of Iran \nare currently barred from entry into the United States, with certain exceptions. The \nUnited States has imposed sanctions on Iran for its nuclear-related activities.  \n \n \nThe United States does not have diplomatic relations with Iran and warns U.S. \ncitizens not to travel to Iran due to risks of arbitrary detention and imprisonment. Human \nrights concerns include: illegal detention in unofficial holding facilities; torture and \ncoerced confessions; and detention and harassment of journalists, lawyers, writers, \nbloggers, dissidents, and others whose actions are deemed unacceptable. There is a \nlack of due process and individuals have limited forms of redress against official abuse. \nVisitors may be placed under surveillance and may be searched without knowledge or \nconsent.  \n \n \nIran has targeted the United States and leverages cyber espionage, propaganda, \nand attacks to support its security priorities. Iran has been identified by the U.S. Director \nof National Intelligence as one of the greatest cyber threats to the United States. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s grandmother is a citizen and resident of Iran. His mother is a dual \nU.S. and Iranian citizen and travels to Iran frequently. There is an articulated heightened \nrisk associated with having relationships with family members in or tied to Iran, due to \nIran\u2019s sponsorship of terrorism, its attempted nuclear proliferation, its cyber threat, and \nthe persistent human rights abuses present there. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s emotional bonds to his relatives in Iran have decreased since he left \nIran at the age of 15 and moved to the United States. His bonds with his immediate and \nextended family in the United States have strengthened his ties here. He attended high \nschool in the United States. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree at a U.S. university. He has \nadapted to the American way of life and plans to remain in the United States. His \ndaughter is solely an American citizen. His ties to his 92-year-old grandmother are \ndiminished. He contacts her infrequently. She is ill and once she has passed, \nApplicant\u2019s mother will not return to Iran. Applicant has little contact with his mother \nwhen she is in Iran. Further even when she is in the United States, he does not discuss \nhis work with her. He demonstrated sufficient relationships with the United States, which \noutweigh any risks associated with his mother or grandmother. AG \u00b6 8(b) provides \nmitigation. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant\u2019s \npersonal property and investments are located in the United States. He has adopted the \nAmerican way of life and considers himself a true American with full loyalty only to the \nUnited States. I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light \nof all pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without doubt as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. \nHe met his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for \nforeign influence. \n \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n     FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 49, has worked for her current employer, a federal contractor since October 2016. She was initially granted access to classified information in 1997 when she began her career with a different federal contracting company. She held a clearance without incident until August 2016, when her former employer filed an incident report in the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS), reporting that Applicant was under investigation for time card fraud and fraudulent expense reports.3 On June 7, 2016, Applicant received an email from the accounts payable department about a travel expense reimbursement request that required additional information before it could be paid. Upon reviewing the document, Applicant realized the voucher was for her daughter, an employee who worked in a different state for another division of the company. Applicant did not supervise her daughter, approve her travel claims, or have any involvement in the details of her daughter\u2019s employment. However, Applicant ordered accounts payable to reject the claim. She then called her daughter to ask about the reimbursement request. That same day, Applicant sent an inquiry to the company\u2019s ethics department asking how to handle the situation.

Edmunds, Esq.  \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nNOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to revoke her eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance to work in the defense industry. Applicant mitigated the concerns \nraised by an investigation into her travel and time reporting by her former employer. \nClearance is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 30, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under the personal conduct guideline.1 DOD \nadjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be \nsubmitted to an administrative judge for a determination whether to revoke Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance.  \n1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as \namended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation, implemented on June 8, 2017.   \n12/27/2018\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing.2 At the hearing, \nconvened on November 27, 2018, I admitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, \nand Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through M, without objection. Applicant and her \ndaughter testified. DOHA received the transcript on December 6, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 49, has worked for her current employer, a federal contractor since \nOctober 2016. She was initially granted access to classified information in 1997 when \nshe began her career with a different federal contracting company. She held a \nclearance without incident until August 2016, when her former employer filed an incident \nreport in the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS), reporting that Applicant was \nunder investigation for time card fraud and fraudulent expense reports.3  \n \n \nOn June 7, 2016, Applicant received an email from the accounts payable \ndepartment about a travel expense reimbursement request that required additional \ninformation before it could be paid. Upon reviewing the document, Applicant realized the \nvoucher was for her daughter, an employee who worked in a different state for another \ndivision of the company. Applicant did not supervise her daughter, approve her travel \nclaims, or have any involvement in the details of her daughter\u2019s employment. However, \nApplicant ordered accounts payable to reject the claim. She then called her daughter to \nask about the reimbursement request. That same day, Applicant sent an inquiry to the \ncompany\u2019s ethics department asking how to handle the situation. The ethics department \ninstructed Applicant to elevate the issue and report it to all parties who needed to be \ninformed. From the emails in the record, Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor was aware of the \nsituation.4  \n \n \nWhen Applicant spoke to her daughter, she claimed that the reimbursement \nrequest was a mistake. Applicant was unsatisfied by the conversation and suspected \nsomething else was amiss. Applicant decided to go to her daughter\u2019s home. When \nApplicant arrived, she discovered that her daughter was addicted to opioids. Her \ndaughter\u2019s home was in disarray and her 2-year-old grandson was not being properly \ncared for. Days after Applicant\u2019s arrival, her daughter resigned her job and entered a \n30-day in-patient drug-treatment program. Applicant returned home with her grandson. \nAfter completing treatment, Applicant\u2019s daughter moved in with Applicant to continue \nwith aftercare and counseling. Applicant\u2019s daughter, now 27, has been sober for two \nyears. She works for a national retailer and attends college. At the hearing, she \ndescribed the details of her fraudulent activity.5  \n \n                                                          \n2 Department Counsel provided discovery to Applicant on June 22, 2018. The discovery letter is \nappended to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I.  \n \n3 Tr. 81; GE 1, GE 3. \n \n4 Tr. 28, 48, 71-73; GE 2, AE H. \n \n5 Tr. 22, 26, 41-42, 48-52, 61. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s daughter\u2019s job involved traveling at least twice per month. Her \nexpenses ranged from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars depending on \nthe length of her project. After each trip she would send an expense report to her \nsupervisor, who, after approving the report, would send it to the accounts payable \ndepartment for payment. In 2014, Applicant\u2019s daughter began abusing opioids and \nbecame addicted. As her addiction grew, she needed more money to buy pills. After \nexamining emails related to older travel claims, Applicant\u2019s daughter devised a plan to \nsubmit fraudulent vouchers. Instead of sending the expense report to her supervisor for \napproval, Applicant\u2019s daughter, who knew her mother had the authority to approve \ntravel vouchers, electronically copied her mother\u2019s signature from personal documents \nand signed the expense reports. She then emailed the approved expense report directly \nto the accounts payable department, which would, seeing Applicant\u2019s authorization, pay \nthe claim. Because Applicant and her daughter do not share the same surname, \nApplicant\u2019s daughter figured that no one would discover their relationship.6  \n \nAt first, Applicant\u2019s daughter would submit a legitimate expense report to her \nsupervisor and also submit a second voucher with some variations, bearing her \nmother\u2019s stolen signature, directly to accounts payable. Soon, she began creating \nexpense reports for fake trips or resubmitting paid vouchers with minor changes. As she \nfiled more reports they became internally inconsistent, for example, reporting air travel \nto one city, but lodging expenses in another city. It is unclear from the record how or \nwhen the internal audit and legal departments learned about Applicant\u2019s daughter\u2019s \nfraudulent expense reports, though it is likely the alert came from the accounts payable \ndepartment after Applicant rejected the June 2016 claim. From the emails in the record \nbetween Applicant and her supervisor, it appears that the issue was being investigated \nbefore Applicant\u2019s June 28, 2016 meeting with the general counsel. During the meeting, \nApplicant learned that her daughter received over $96,000 from fraudulent travel claims. \nApplicant also learned that the company also audited her travel claims and time cards \nand discovered three duplicate travel claims for almost $7,000. One claim was filed in \n2015, two were filed in 2016. The investigation did not find any evidence of time card \nfraud.7  \n \nBetween 2013 and 2016, Applicant lived in another state, and traveled to the \ncompany\u2019s headquarters every week. The company reimbursed her weekly travel and \nlodging expenses. In addition to her weekly travel to headquarters, Applicant also \ntraveled extensively for her job. Between 2006 and 2016, she estimates that she \nsubmitted over 100 travel expense reports each year. Sometimes Applicant submitted \nthe reports herself and sometimes her assistant submitted reports on her behalf. She \nbelieves that miscommunication between them may have led to the duplicate expense \nreports. Applicant admits that she was aware of one 2015 duplicate report, but failed to \nreport it because she was distracted by the events in her personal life, specifically, her \n                                                          \n6 Tr. 18, 28-29, 33-34, 37-49.  \n \n7 Tr. 36-40; GE 2.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nhusband\u2019s diagnosis and treatment for a serious medical issue. She was unaware of the \ntwo 2016 duplicate claims.8  \n \nAfter being presenting with the results of the internal audits, Applicant tendered \nher resignation to her supervisor. Her supervisor discouraged her from doing so, but \nApplicant, who was embarrassed by the extent of her daughter\u2019s fraud and her own \nnegligence, believed that resigning was the only ethical option. When the company filed \nthe incident report in JPAS, the report indicated that Applicant resigned before the \ninternal investigation was complete. Applicant focused her efforts on protecting her \ndaughter from criminal liability. To that end, she agreed to repay the $96,000 received \nby her daughter and the $7,000 of her own duplicate expenses, if the company agreed \nnot to press criminal charges against her daughter. Applicant and the company entered \ninto a settlement and restitution agreement in August 2016. She resolved the debt using \nproceeds from her retirement and other cash savings. In September 2016, the company \nreached out to Applicant about a job opportunity, which she declined.9  \n \nApplicant began working for her current employer in October 2016 in a similar \nrole as her former employment. She disclosed the events at her prior employer to her \ncurrent employer.10  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n                                                          \n8 Tr. 53-55, 62-63, 87; GE 2. \n \n9 Tr. 23-24, 47, 64-67; GE 2. \n \n10 Tr. 43-48, 68,  \n\n \n5 \n \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nof potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n` \nAnalysis \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant resigned from her position in August 2016 while \nunder investigation by her former employer for time card fraud and fraudulent expense \nreports. She became the object of investigation because of her daughter\u2019s misconduct, \nnot any misconduct of her own.11 Given the extent of her daughter\u2019s fraud, the \ndaughter\u2019s use of Applicant\u2019s signature to perpetuate the fraud, and the large number of \ntravel reimbursement claims Applicant filed in the execution of her duties, the internal \naudit of her travel claims and time cards was appropriate. Ultimately, the investigation \nrevealed that between 2015 and 2016, Applicant submitted three duplicate travel claims \nand that she received $7,000 to which she was not entitled. The investigation did not \nreveal any time card fraud. Applicant admits to knowing about the 2015 duplicate claim \nand that she did not alert her employer to the mistake.  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with her daughter, who was involved in criminal activity, raised \nconcerns about her own possible misconduct.12 Applicant\u2019s failure to report and remedy \nthe 2015 duplicate travel reimbursement is evidence of misuse of her former employer\u2019s \nresources and may support a whole-person assessment of questionable judgement, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that Applicant may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information.13 However, the record contains sufficient evidence to \nmitigate these concerns. \n \nThe circumstances prompting the investigation occurred under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on her ongoing \nsecurity worthiness.14 Applicant\u2019s daughter engaged in fraudulent activity facilitated by \nthe unauthorized use of Applicant\u2019s signature. Applicant acted appropriately and \nresponsibly in light of these circumstances. She prevented payment of the daughter\u2019s \n                                                          \n11 The allegation on its face does not allege any disqualifying conduct, but was enough to put Applicant \non notice that the adverse information prompting the investigation raised potential security concerns. \n \n12 AG \u00b6 16(g).  \n \n13 AG \u00b6 16(d).  \n \n14 AG \u00b6 17g).  \n\n \n6 \n \nJune 2016 travel claim upon receiving a notification from accounts payable. She \nimmediately sought guidance from her company\u2019s ethics committee, reported the \nincident to her immediate supervisor, and participated fully in the company\u2019s \ninvestigation. It does not appear that Applicant\u2019s employer took any issue with her \nhandling or reporting of her daughter\u2019s fraudulent activity.  \n \nThe investigation into Applicant\u2019s daughter\u2019s misconduct, revealed three \nduplicate travel vouchers belonging to Applicant. However, she provided a reasonable \nexplanation for the three duplicate travel claims \u2013 miscommunication between herself \nand her assistant. Though the time period covered by the investigation is unclear, the \naudit resulted in three duplicate reports in a population of hundreds of claims filed by \nApplicant. It does not appear that the company viewed the three duplicate claims as a \nserious offense on its own, as the company attempted to re-hire Applicant a month after \nshe tendered her resignation. While Applicant\u2019s actions may have been negligent, they \nare not indicative of a pattern of misconduct. The offense is minor and does not reflect \nnegatively on Applicant\u2019s current security worthiness.15  \n \nApplicant promptly repaid her daughter\u2019s fraudulent claims and her three \nduplicate claims. She reported the incident to her current employer. While Applicant is \nembarrassed by her daughter\u2019s misconduct and her own acts of negligence, it is not an \nongoing source of vulnerability for her.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nBased on the record, I have no doubts about Applicant\u2019s ongoing security \nworthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-person factors \nat AG \u00b6 2(d). In the course of less than 60 days, Applicant resolved a difficult set of \ncircumstances caused by her daughter\u2019s misconduct. She successfully balanced her \nfiduciary duties to her employer while ensuring her daughter received proper medical \ncare, and protecting her daughter from criminal liability. She candidly provided adverse \ninformation as required and took responsibility for her own negligence in the handling of \nher duplicate travel claims. The purpose of a security clearance adjudication is not to \npunish an applicant for past misconduct, but but rather to determine if an appellant\u2019s \npast actions are indicative of a current inability to properly handle and protect classified. \nHere, Applicant demonstrated that she will seek guidance when confronted a \nproblematic situation and that she will report adverse information as required, without \nregard for her self-interest. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n15 AG \u00b6 17(a). \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:  \n \nParagraph 1, Personal Conduct:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The documents appended to the FORM \nare admitted as Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 45, has worked for his current employer, a federal contractor, since \nDecember 2003. He completed a security clearance, his first, in April 2017. The ensuing \ninvestigation revealed undisclosed federal income tax and delinquent consumer debts. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes $19,000 in unpaid federal tax debt for the 2013 \nthrough 2016 tax years, and three delinquent accounts totaling $3,300.3 \n \nBetween 2009 and 2012, Applicant timely filed his federal income tax returns \nusing the \u201chead of household\u201d filing status. In 2013, his wife started a small business. \nHowever, she did not pay income or self-employment taxes as she earned income. \nSometime after starting the business, she experienced a health crisis that affected her \nability to work. During her ailment, she hired employees to ensure the business \nremained a going concern. Although Applicant filed his 2013 through 2016 federal \nincome tax returns on time, he could not afford to pay his federal tax obligations when \nthey were due.4  \n \nAccording to the tax transcripts in the record, Applicant owes $2,433 in federal \nincome taxes for 2013, $3,002 for 2014, $8,887 for 2015, and $3,844 for 2016. He \nestablished an installment agreement for the 2013 taxes in April 2014. He did not make \nany payments under the agreement and the IRS terminated it February 2015. He \nattempted to establish an installment agreement for the 2014 though 2016 income tax \nobligations in April 2017; however, the installment agreement was terminated that \nmonth. In March 2017, Applicant consulted a law firm specializing in tax issues to \nnegotiate a settlement with the IRS on his behalf. He claims that the firm advised him to \nstop making payments on the tax debt until they reached a settlement. In his SOR \nanswer, Applicant claims that as of March 2018, he established a payment plan with the \nIRS for $300 each month.

The record does not contain information about Applicant\u2019s current \nhousehold finances.6 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nadministrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence. \n  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nUnresolved delinquent debt is a serious security concern because failure to \n\u201csatisfy debts [or] meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation.\u201d7  \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to pay his federal income taxes for 2013 \nthrough 2016, totaling $19,000 and that he owes almost $3,300 on three delinquent \n                                                          \n6 GE 2. \n \n7  AG \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nconsumer accounts. The record contains sufficient evidence to establish the \nGovernment\u2019s prima facie case that: Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial \nobligations, an inability to satisfy his debts, and that he has failed to timely pay annual \nfederal income tax as required.8  \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the alleged concerns. While his wife\u2019s medical issues \nmay have caused some financial difficulty for Applicant, he has not established that he \nhas acted responsibly in light of his circumstances. Although he has made several \nattempts over the years to resolve his federal tax debt, he has failed to establish a track \nrecord of repayment and reform. Overall Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his delinquent \naccounts are not enough to constitute a good-faith effort to repay his creditors. \nUltimately, Applicant has failed to establish that his finances are under control.  \n \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s current suitability for \naccess to classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the \nwhole-person factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). After the Government presents evidence raising \nsecurity concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those \nconcerns.9 An applicant is reasonably expected to provide corroborating documentation \nregarding his financial interests. Applicant failed to do so. As a result, he did not meet \nhis burdens of production and persuasion to refute or mitigate the financial \nconsiderations allegations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \n \nAGANST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g:   \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nBased on the record, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Nerney, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCOACHER, Robert E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 23, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017 (AG). \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 25, 2018. She elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on June 28, 2018. The evidence \n12/20/2018\n\n \n2 \n \n \nincluded in the FORM is identified as Items 3-9 (Items 1 and 2 include pleadings and \ntransmittal information). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it on July 24, \n2018. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. On September 5, 2018, Applicant\u2019s counsel \nentered his appearance, filed a written response to the FORM (FE I), and submitted \nexhibits (AE) A-D. Applicant did not object to the Government\u2019s evidence and Items 3-9 \nare admitted.1 Applicant exhibits are also admitted without objection. The case was \nassigned to me on December 12, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied all the allegations in the SOR. After a careful review of the \npleadings and evidence, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 45 years old. She has worked for a federal contractor since February \n2016 as a translator at an overseas location. Her previous employment was in the \nprivate sector. She experienced periods of unemployment from 2009 to 2013, and from \n2006 to 2008. She was married for the second time in 2007, although she claims she is \ncurrently separated from her husband. Her first marriage was from 1991 to 2004. She \nhas three adult children from this marriage. She has two children from her current \nmarriage. She is a high school graduate.2 \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant has 12 charged-off and collection accounts in the \ntotal amount owed of approximately $14,466. The allegations are supported by credit \nreports from April 2018, November 2017, March 2017, and February 2016.3 \n \n \nApplicant explained in her SOR answer and FORM response that the nine \nmedical collection debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.f-1.i, and 1.k-1.m) were disputed because \nshe had insurance during that time that should have paid these debts. She pointed out \nthat all but two of these debts no longer appeared on her latest credit report. The \nremaining two that still remain (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b) are of minimal security \nsignificance. I find for Applicant concerning all the medical accounts.4  \n \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s counsel made two objections to the FORM. First, he states that the FORM erroneously \nrefers to Guideline E when it should refer to Guideline F (FORM p. 2, para. 2). That objection is sustained \nand the correct reference should be Guideline F. I will consider the language as referring to Guideline F. \nSecond, Applicant\u2019s counsel objects, based on relevance, to Department Counsel arguing about past \ndebts not alleged in the SOR (FORM p. 3, para. 3). I will not consider any unalleged debts for \ndisqualification purposes, but I will consider such information as it may relate to the application of any \nmitigating conditions and the whole-person factors. To that extent, the objection is sustained.   \n \n2 Item 3. \n \n3 Items 2, 4-6. \n \n4 Items 2, 6-9; FE I. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nThe three remaining delinquent accounts are from credit cards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.e). \nApplicant denied these debts because she claimed that they all were opened by her \nhusband using her credit information, social security number, and other personal \nidentifying information without her permission. She stated that because of her religion \nand culture, she had no right to question her husband\u2019s handling of their finances or use \nof the credit cards. She acknowledged during her background interview that she was a \ncosigner on the accounts. Credit reports also show that the two largest credit card \ndelinquencies were opened before her marriage to her current husband. She claims that \nshe is separated from her husband and has made efforts to contact the creditors to \nremove the accounts from her name. She failed to provide documentation supporting \nthese assertions. Her bank account statements from August 2018 indicated that her \nhusband remains named on their checking account. All these accounts remain unpaid \nand are unresolved.5  \n \n \nApplicant submitted several character letters in support of her receiving a \nclearance. Four were from personnel related to her current position. Applicant is \ndescribed as loyal, professional, honest, and patriotic by those who worked with her as \na translator. Two letters were also provided by supervisors in her private sector \nemployment where she was described as professional and loyal.6   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n                                                          \n5 Items 2, 6-9; FE I; AE D. \n \n6 AE A. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant has delinquent debts that remain unpaid. I find all the above \ndisqualifying conditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nNone of these mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s debts are recent and \nremain unresolved. She did not provide sufficient evidence to show that her financial \nproblems are unlikely to recur. She did not substantiate that she is separated from her \nhusband and that he no longer has any influence over her finances. AG \u00b6 20(a) does \nnot apply. Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s unauthorized use of her credit and resulting debt may \nbe considered a condition beyond her control, however, she failed to take responsible \nactions to address her resulting debts by substantiating that she has separated herself \nfrom his control. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. She addressed her medical debts, \nbut the delinquent credit card debt remains. There is no evidence of financial \ncounseling. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) partially apply toward the medical debts. She failed \nto document her dispute of the credit card debt. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s translator \nduties in service to our military, and the circumstances that led to her financial \ndifficulties. Applicant has not established a track record of financial stability.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations.7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f \u2013 1.i: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.k \u2013 1.m:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n                                                          \n7 I considered the exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Appendix C, \ndated June 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nRobert E.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se  \n__________ \nDecision \n__________ \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant demonstrated that circumstances beyond her control contributed to or \naggravated her financial problems. She should have been more diligent addressing her \ndelinquent accounts. Notwithstanding, she recently paid off all of her delinquent \naccounts (except one) and demonstrated that she is living within her financial means. \nHer financial problems are resolved or are being resolved. Clearance granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted her first security clearance application (SCA) on May 24, \n2016, seeking eligibility for a clearance required for her position with a federal \ncontractor. After reviewing the information gathered during the background \ninvestigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued her a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) on \nJanuary 26, 2018. She answered the SOR and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on \nFebruary 12, 2018.  \nDOHA assigned the case to me on July 19, 2018. The Notice of Hearing (NOH) \nwas issued on November 28, 2018, setting a hearing for December 12, 2018. At the \n02/28/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nhearing, the Government offered four exhibits (GE 1 through 4). Applicant testified, \npresented favorable character testimony through one witness, and submitted three \nexhibits. (AE 1 through 3) All exhibits were admitted without objection. DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 2, 2019. \n \nProcedural Issue \n \nApplicant affirmatively waived her right to 15-days of advanced notice of her \nhearing. (Tr. 11-12) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her SOR answer, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.d through 1.f, and 1.h. She denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.g. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions to the SOR and those at her hearing are incorporated herein as findings of \nfact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, including her testimony and \ndemeanor while testifying, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She completed a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in May 2012, and a master\u2019s degree in 2015, both in criminal justice. \nShe married her first spouse in 2007, separated in 2009, and divorced in 2012. She \nmarried her second spouse in 2012 and divorced in 2016. She has two children, ages \n18 and 10.  \n \nIn her May 2016 SCA, Applicant disclosed that she had financial problems that \nincluded a repossessed car and numerous delinquent credit accounts, most of them \nalleged in the SOR. Applicant credibly explained that her financial problems resulted \nfrom her extensive periods of unemployment, her 2012 divorce, several relocations to \ndifferent states seeking help from family members or job opportunities, and she being \nthe sole provider for her children. Applicant noted that one of her children is entitled to \ncourt-ordered financial support; however, the father only provides sporadic support and \nis in arrears. (Tr. 25) Additionally, Applicant\u2019s 78-year-old mother developed breast \ncancer, and Applicant moved to another state to care for her mother and provided her \nwith some financial assistance. \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment history shows that she worked as a city police officer \nbetween 2001 and October 2005. She was laid off after a hurricane destroyed the city\u2019s \ninfrastructure and was unemployed between October 2005 and June 2006. She was \nemployed between June 2006 and February 2009, as an assistant bank manager. She \nwas unemployed between February 2009 and January 2010. She was employed during \na probationary period as a city police officer between January 2010 and December \n2012. She was not offered the position after the probationary period ended, and was \nunemployed between December 2011 and October 2012.  \n \nApplicant was employed as a part-time legal clerk between October 2012 and \nAugust 2014, and unemployed between August 2014 and November 2014. She was \n\n \n3 \n \n \nemployed with a Federal agency between November 2014 and January 2015, and \nunemployed between January and March 2015. She was rehired by the federal agency \nin March 2015 and worked there until March 2016. Her current employer and clearance \nsponsor, a federal contractor, hired Applicant in March 2016, and she was been working \nthere until the present. \n \nMost of the alleged SOR debts date back to the period surrounding Applicant\u2019s \n2009 marital separation and 2012 divorce. She stated that she did not address her \ndelinquent debts sooner because she believed they were paid by her ex-husband after \nthe divorce. She realized she had delinquent debts when she received the January \n2018 SOR. Applicant explained that even if she had known about her delinquent debts \nsooner, she was the sole breadwinner of the family, and her income was insufficient to \npay her family\u2019s living expenses and pay her debts.  \n \nSince January 2018, Applicant has been diligently addressing her delinquent \naccounts. The SOR alleged eight delinquent or charged-off accounts. Applicant\u2019s \ndocumentary evidence (AE 1) shows that she settled and paid seven of the SOR debts \n(\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f and 1.h).  \n \nThe remaining debt, SOR \u00b6 1.g, alleged a delinquent car note for $12,985. \nApplicant and her first husband purchased a car in 2008. When they separated in 2009, \nher ex-husband promised to make the car payments, but he failed to do so. When the \ncreditor confronted her with the delinquent payments, she voluntarily surrendered the \ncar to the creditor. I note that the debt is more than seven years old, and as such it is \nuncollectable. Her ex-husband has some responsibility for paying the debt. Additionally, \nApplicant disputed the debt (GE 2), and it is no longer reflected on Applicant\u2019s more \nrecent credit reports.  \n \nApplicant acknowledged that she should have been more diligent paying her \ndelinquent accounts. However, she believes she was doing the best she could do under \nher circumstances. She understands the seriousness of the security concerns raised by \nher financial problems. Applicant credibly promised to timely pay her debts in the future \nand to resolve her financial problems.  \n \nApplicant believes that with her current income, her financial situation is now \nstable, and she will be able to maintain her financial responsibility and eligibility for a \nclearance. Her hourly wage is $30.80, and she makes between $75,000 and $85,000 a \nyear, depending on overtime. Applicant has not received financial counseling, but she is \nfollowing a budget, subscribed to credit reporting agencies to keep track of her finances, \nand purchased books to help her improve her credit. (Tr. 22-23).  \n \nApplicant owes about $130,000 in student loans. She is current on her student \nloan payments and is paying them under an income-based repayment plan. Applicant \nunderstands that for her to be eligible for a clearance, and her job with a Federal \ncontractor, she has to maintain and demonstrate her financial responsibility. A review of \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent credit reports shows that she has no current delinquencies, and \nshe is keeping up on her finances. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the  Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG), implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 2. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch \nin regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .  \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems is documented in the record. AG \u00b6 19 \nprovides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations.\u201d The record established the disqualifying conditions, requiring \nadditional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.1  \n                                            \n1 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \n \nAll of the above financial considerations mitigating conditions are raised by the \nfacts in this case and mitigate the security concerns. She developed financial problems \nbecause of numerous periods of unemployment, her divorce, her being the sole family \nprovider, and caring for and providing some financial assistance to her mother. \nApplicant recently paid off all the SOR debts (except SOR \u00b6 1.g). Her ex-husband has \nsome responsibility for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g. She currently has no delinquencies \nreflected in her credit reports and appears to be living within her financial means. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems occurred under circumstances unlikely to recur, and they \ndo not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to resolve her debt, although recent, show diligence and \nresponsibility in the handling of her financial obligations. Applicant has not received \nfinancial counseling, but she is following a budget. Considering the evidence as a \nwhole, Applicant resolved or is resolving her financial problems and her finances are \nunder control. She credibly promised to maintain her financial responsibility. Her \nearnings should be sufficient to pay for her family\u2019s living expenses and current debts. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under \nthat guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n                                                                                                                                            \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).   \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for \nher employer since 2016. This is her first clearance application. The record evidence is \nsufficient to establish that her financial problems are resolved or are being resolved, and \nher finances are under control. Applicant demonstrated a recent track record of paying \nher financial obligations. She is fully aware of the security concerns raised by her failure \nto maintain financial responsibility. She promised to maintain her financial responsibility. \nThe financial considerations security concerns are mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.h:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest of the United States to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance to Applicant. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Thomas Albin, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant defaulted on several consumer credit accounts because of lack of income. \nHe made small payments on some of his past-due debts from July 2017 to January 2018, \nwhen he lost his job with a defense contractor because of a lack of security clearance. He \nhas yet to fully mitigate the concerns about his financial judgment. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 16, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) and Guideline E (personal conduct). \nThe SOR explained why the DOD CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF \ntook the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \n09/04/2018\n\n2 \n \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 26, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn February 20, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. On February 27, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for March 21, 2018. \n \nAt the hearing, five Government exhibits (GEs 1-5) were admitted. A February 14, \n2018 letter forwarding the proposed GEs to Applicant\u2019s counsel and a list of the GEs were \nmarked as hearing exhibits (HEs I-II) for the record but not admitted in evidence. On the \nGovernment\u2019s motion and without objection from Applicant, SOR \u00b6 1.i under Guideline F \nand the Guideline E allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b) were withdrawn. Three Applicant \nexhibits (AEs A-C) were admitted in evidence. Applicant and his spouse testified, as \nreflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on March 30, 2018. \n \nI held the record open for two weeks for post-hearing submissions from Applicant. \nNo documents were received by the deadline, so the record closed on April 4, 2018. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \n \nThe SOR as amended alleges under Guideline F that, as of January 16, 2018, \nApplicant owed charged-off credit card debt totaling $17,116 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d); \ncredit card collection debt totaling $6,991 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, and 1.g); a $1,765 wireless \ntelephone debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.f); a $296 medical debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.h); and \ntwo financial judgments from 2015 for $2,104 (SOR \u00b6 1.j) and $7,489 (SOR \u00b6 1.k). When \nApplicant responded to the SOR, Applicant denied only two debts: the wireless telephone \ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.f) and the medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.h), both of which he was disputing. \nApplicant denied that the account in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($10,100) had been charged off. He \nindicated that he was making monthly payments on that debt and on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c ($3,965), 1.g ($728), 1.j ($2,104 judgment), and 1.k ($7,489 judgment). (Answer.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 53 years old and a high school graduate. (Tr. 16.) He and his spouse \nmarried in 2000. They have three children.1 Applicant owned and operated an auto sales \nbusiness for about 15 years until September 2005. He sold the business to care for his \nwife, who had been injured in a car accident in 2005. (GE 1, Tr. 95.) She returned to work \nin the mutual funds industry within weeks of her surgery (Tr. 76), but Applicant was \n                                                 \n1 On his SF 86, Applicant listed a biological son, now age 17, and two adopted daughters, now ages 15 and \n21. (GE 1; Tr. 29.) The daughters\u2019 surname is the same as his spouse\u2019s maiden name. (GE 1.) \n\n3 \n \nunemployed for over a year. (GE 1.) Unbeknownst to Applicant at the time, his spouse \nbegan gambling at a local casino in 2005. (99, 102.) \n \n \nIn January 2007, Applicant purchased a vehicle towing business. (GE 1; Tr. 19.) He \nlater learned that the company had a lawsuit pending against it from an accident caused by \nthe previous owner\u2019s son. Applicant spent about two years in arbitration.  He states that he \ndid not make much money in the towing business, but he had a towing contract with the \nlocal police. (GE 1; Tr. 50.)  \n \n \nIn April 2008, Applicant purchased a home for his family, obtaining a mortgage loan \nfor $130,050. (GEs 2-4.) His spouse had a motor vehicle accident in 2008. (Tr. 77.) In \nJanuary 2010, Applicant sold the towing business after his contract with the local police \nwas not renewed. (GE 1; Tr. 29-30.) Applicant had no employment income from January \n2010 until October 2016. In late 2010, his spouse needed additional surgery after being \nrear-ended a third time. (Tr. 96-97.) In contrast to her previous surgeries, where she was \nable to return to work within weeks, she had debilitating pain. She developed an addiction \nto opiate medication.2  (Tr. 78-79, 100-101.) \n \n \nIn January 2011, the IRS filed a $20,269 tax lien against Applicant and his spouse \nfor unpaid taxes for tax year 2007. (GE 3.) His spouse had taken a premature withdrawal of \nher 401(k) assets, in part to fund her gambling. (Tr. 71, 102.) They filed an amended tax \nreturn for 2007 and paid the tax debt in December 2011.3 (GE 3; Tr. 103.) In September \n2011, Applicant\u2019s sister died unexpectedly in a car accident. Applicant\u2019s parents provided a \nhome for his sister\u2019s children, who were then ages 17, 19, and 20, but Applicant and his \nspouse helped the children financially. (GE 1; Tr. 22-23, 82.) \n \nIn March 2012, Applicant\u2019s parents purchased a two-family property, obtaining a \nmortgage for approximately $100,000.4 The plan was to provide a home for their \ngrandchildren who had lost their mother and obtain a renter for the other unit. Applicant \nrelied on his personal credit cards to pay for renovations and refurbishing the property. (Tr. \n49, 83.) He completed the renovation work himself, which took him over a year. His father \ndied within the next year or so, and his mother inherited the property. The property has had \ntenants on and off. The present rent is $1,800 a month. (Tr. 31-32, 37.) Apart from \n                                                 \n2 Applicant\u2019s spouse began taking a prescribed narcotic in 2008. Her physician switched her to oxycodone and \nincreased her dosages. Eventually, he prescribed 12-hour release Oxycontin. She was slowly weaned off \nopiates under the care of a physician from 2013 to 2015. (Tr. 100-101.) \n  \n3 Neither Applicant nor his spouse had employment income at the time, although Applicant\u2019s spouse had some \nsettlement money from her accidents. There is no explanation in the record for the source of the tax payment. \n \n4 Applicant indicated on his SF 86 that he has \u201cacted as Property Manager/Owner\u201d since 2012. (GE 1.) When \nhe was interviewed in February 2017, he explained that he did not own the property but instead manages it for \nhis mother. (GE 5.) At his hearing, he responded affirmatively when asked to confirm that he bought the \nproperty in March 2012 and that he has been renting it out for the past five years. After paying the mortgage at \napproximately $600 a month, property taxes, and expenses, the remaining rental income is $500 a month if \nthe property is fully rented. (Tr. 33-34.) There is no open mortgage on Applicant\u2019s credit reports for the \nproperty. It appears that his mother makes the mortgage payment. Applicant subsequently confirmed that the \nrental property belongs to his mother, and she receives the rental income. (Tr. 49-50.) \n\n4 \n \nmanaging the property part time for his mother, Applicant had no other employment. (GE \n1.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse received settlements from her three car accidents totaling \napproximately $117,000.5 (Tr. 97.) Applicant bought a 2007 model-year car for $27,000 \ncash in 2012. They paid for their son\u2019s expenses playing baseball and some household \nbills. They also put some of the money into remodeling the house his parents bought. His \nspouse also gambled away some of the money. (GE 5; Tr. 35-36, 81, 98.) She played \npoker at a local casino from 2005 to 2012 and hid her gambling with $3,000 to $6,000 of \nhousehold income per month from Applicant. (Tr. 99-100.) After Applicant learned about \nthe IRS tax lien, she admitted to him that she was addicted to pain medication and had \nbeen gambling. Facing divorce and not wanting to break up the family, she stopped \ngambling in 2012. (Tr. 102.) \n \nApplicant and his spouse twice considered filing for bankruptcy but wanted to pay \ntheir debts. When Applicant filled out his application to work for a defense contractor in \n2016, they heard that \u201cyou can\u2019t have a bankruptcy on your record,\u201d so they decided \nagainst filing. (Tr. 84-85.) \n \nOn July 27, 2016, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) incorporated within an e-QIP. \nConcerning any financial delinquency involving enforcement in the last seven years, \nApplicant listed the federal tax lien that was repaid (allegation withdrawn). He listed no \nother delinquencies involving enforcement, and responded \u201cNo\u201d to whether he had a \njudgment entered against him in the last seven years. Concerning delinquencies involving \nroutine accounts, Applicant listed one debt: a $9,000 state tax delinquency from 2005 that \nhe was reportedly repaying at $50 a month (not alleged). Applicant responded negatively to \ninquiries concerning any other delinquency involving routine accounts, including whether \nhe had any bills or debts turned over to a collection agency in the last seven years and \nwhether he had any accounts or credit cards suspended, charged off, or cancelled for \nfailing to pay as agreed in the last seven years.6 (GE 1.) \n \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on August 27, 2016, revealed two unpaid judgment \ndebts for $7,489 from July 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.k) and $2,104 from October 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.j); a \ncharged-off credit card debt for $12,311 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); and six collection debts totaling \n$14,165 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d and 1.f-1.h). (GE 2.)  \n \nAfter four years with no employment other than managing his mother\u2019s rental \nproperty, Applicant began working as an outside machinist for a defense contractor in \n                                                 \n5 Applicant apparently had a cash-out of $47,100 from his credit union account. He indicated that it was from \nhis spouse\u2019s insurance settlement (GE 5), which she recalls receiving in 2012. (Tr. 81.) \n \n6 The Government\u2019s withdrawal of the personal conduct allegations removes falsification as a potentially \ndisqualifying concern. What Applicant knew about his finances remains an issue because of its implications \nfor his current and future financial management and financial judgment.  \n\n5 \n \nOctober 2016 after two weeks of paid training in September 2016. (GEs 1, 5; Tr. 17.) His \nstarting hourly wage was just over $17 an hour. (Tr. 20.) \n \n \nOn February 28, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant was asked whether he had any \ndebts over 120 days overdue or in collection within the last seven years that had not been \nlisted on his SF 86. He responded negatively and was then confronted with the adverse \ncredit information on his record. Applicant did not dispute the delinquencies, but he was \nunable to provide any details about the debts. He indicated that his spouse was aware of \nthem and that they were making payments. He attributed his financial difficulties to his \nperiods of unemployment and his spouse having had multiple car accidents and surgeries. \nHe denied that any of the financial issues were due to gambling or alcohol. Applicant \ndescribed his finances as improving now that he had income from his defense-contractor \nemployment. (GE 5.) \n \n \nAs of June 26, 2017, Equifax was reporting that Applicant\u2019s home loan had been \nmodified under a federal government program in September 2015. His home mortgage had \nbeen delinquent throughout the fall of 2014. (GE 4.) The delinquency and payment \nhistories for the accounts in the SOR are as follows: \n \nCharged-off debt for $10,100 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit card account, opened in February 1992, was charged off for \n$12,311 in June 2014 after becoming delinquent in September 2012. (GE 2.) The card was \nused to remodel the home for his parents. (Tr. 81-82.) As of May 2017, the account was \npast due for $10,100. (GE 3.) Applicant was brought to court over the debt, and he agreed \nto garnishment of his wages at $75 a week. His wages were garnished throughout 2017.7 \n(GE 4; AE A; Tr. 27, 41, 59.) The garnishment stopped because he lost his job with the \ndefense contractor. As of January 2018, Equifax was reporting a past-due balance of \n$7,925. (GE 4.) Applicant made no payments on his own after garnishment stopped. (Tr. \n41-42.) His spouse testified that when he became unemployed, she contacted the \ncollection agency to renegotiate the terms of repayment. Applicant and his spouse are \nwaiting for a decision on his security clearance eligibility before resuming payments. (Tr. \n58-59.) \n \nCharged-off debt for $4,688 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit card account, opened in September 2006, became delinquent in \nApril 2013. It went into collections in August 2013 before being charged off for $4,701. \n(GEs 2, 4.) One payment was made in December 2016 to reduce the past-due balance to \n$4,668. (GEs 3, 4.) As of January 2018, Appellant and his spouse were attempting to \nnegotiate a payoff of his debt. (Tr. 42.) The creditor agreed to settle for $2,600, but they \nhave been unable to commit to the payment without knowing whether Applicant would \nregain his job with the defense contractor. (Tr. 62, 111.) \n                                                 \n7 As of the week ending November 25, 2017, $3,787 had been garnished from his wages in 2017. (AE A,) At \n$75 a week, the garnishment would have started before his February 28, 2017 interview. \n\n6 \n \nCollection debt for $3,965 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \n \n \nA credit card account, opened in December 2010, became delinquent in April 2013. \nIt was charged off for $3,114 in November 2013, and then placed for collection for $3,841 \nin June 2015. As of June 2017, the past-due balance was $3,965. (GEs 2, 3.) Applicant\u2019s \nspouse testified that neither she nor Applicant can recall opening the account, which was \nobtained in Applicant\u2019s name. They disputed the debt on that basis, but they began \nrepaying the debt. (GE 4; Tr. 63.) As of February 2018, the account had a past-due \nbalance of $3,765. (GE 4.) \n \nCharged-off debt for $2,328 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) \n \n \nApplicant opened a credit card account in January 2012 with a home-furnishings \nretailer. His account was charged off and closed by the creditor in June 2013 with a past-\ndue balance of $2,328 after inactivity since May 2013. (GEs 2-4.) Applicant\u2019s spouse \ntestified that the account has been closed and that the creditor was going to send a 1099-C \n(Cancellation of Debt) form to them. (Tr. 63-64.) No 1099-C form was submitted into the \nrecord either during or after the hearing.  \n \nCollection debt for $2,244 (SOR \u00b6 1.e, possibly the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.j) \n \n \nIn April 2014, Applicant\u2019s credit card account with a retailer was assigned for \ncollection for $2,105 after inactivity since February 2013. In October 2015, the collection \nentity (collection agency X) obtained a judgment for $2,104, which appears to be for the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.e.8 As of June 2017, collection agency X was reporting a collection \nbalance of $2,244 on the debt. (GEs 2-3.) As of February 2018, Equifax was reporting a \npast-due balance of $2,004 on the account in SOR \u00b6 1.e with a date of last payment in \nJanuary 2018. (GE 4.) \n \nCollection debt for $1,765 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) \n \n \nIn April 2015, a wireless phone service placed a $1,765 balance from May 2013 for \ncollection. (GE 2.) As of June 2017, the debt had not been paid. (GE 3.) Applicant disputed \nhis liability (Answer), and the debt was no longer on his credit record as of February 2018. \n(GE 4.) Applicant\u2019s spouse testified that her sister applied for wireless phone service in her \nname without her knowledge. (Tr. 67-68.) Neither Applicant nor his spouse have filed a \nreport with the police of identity theft because they have yet to see the result of their \nverification request with the creditor. (Tr. 116.) \n \nCollection debt for $782 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) \n \n \nApplicant bought some merchandise on credit from a mail order company in \nDecember 2012. When his account became six months past due in October 2013, it was \nplaced for collection for $782. (GEs 2-4.) Applicant\u2019s spouse testified that $25 monthly \n                                                 \n8 The high credit on the account in collection was $2,105. The collection entity obtained a $2,104 judgment in \nOctober 2015. \n\n7 \n \npayments went toward that debt (Tr. 69), although Equifax was not showing any progress \ntoward resolving that debt as of February 2018. (GE 4.)  \n \nMedical collection debt for $296 (SOR \u00b6 1.h) \n \n \nIn February 2016, a $296 medical debt from July 2010 was placed for collection. \n(GE 2.) Applicant initially disputed the debt, believing that insurance should have covered \nit. He and his spouse later learned that he had incurred the debt during a gap in his \ninsurance coverage. (Tr. 69.) Applicant\u2019s spouse testified that the debt has been paid. (Tr. \n70.) Applicant provided no documentation in that regard, but the debt was no longer on his \ncredit report as of June 2017. (GE 3.) \n \nJudgment debt for $7,489 (SOR \u00b6 1.k) \n \n \nIn April 2014, Applicant\u2019s credit card with a home improvement retailer went to \ncollections with a balance of $7,490. In July 2015, the collection entity obtained a $7,489 \njudgment. (GEs 2-4.) Available copies of money orders show that Applicant paid a \ncollection entity $50 on December 14, 2017, and on January 16, 2018. (AE B.) After a \npayment in January 2018, Applicant owed a past-due balance of $7,439. (GE 4.) \nApplicant\u2019s spouse made another $50 payment on February 8, 2018. (AE B.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse testified that she made monthly payments of $25 each on four \ndelinquent accounts held by a collection law firm. (Tr. 72.) Available money orders show \nseparate payments of $25 each on three accounts on January 5, 2017, June 14, 2017, July \n17, 2017, and August 12, 2017; a $150 payment covering three accounts on October 6, \n2017 (apparently covering a missed September payment and the October 2017 payment); \na single $75 payment on November 11, 2017; three $25 payments on December 14, 2017; \nand three $25 payments on January 16, 2018. (AE B.) The payments were likely toward \nthe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e, given Applicant\u2019s credit report showed a last payment on \nthose accounts in January 2018, and possibly 1.g, based on his spouse\u2019s testimony.9 \nPayments toward the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k were to a different collection entity. (AE B.) \n \n \nApplicant regularly worked overtime for the defense contractor because he had bills \nto pay. He had only two days off between October 2016 and January 2018, when he was \nwalked off the job because of the issuance of the SOR. (Tr. 18, 25, 38.) He was paid time \nand a half on Saturdays and double time on Sundays. (Tr. 38.) He received three pay \nincreases while at the defense contractor, including a raise to a base pay of $21.79 an \nhour just before he lost his job. (Tr. 20-21.) He is subject to recall if his clearance is \nadjudicated favorably. (Tr. 25-26.) As of March 2018, Applicant had unemployment income \nof $643 a week. (Tr. 26-27.) He had about $800 in his checking account and only $25 in \nsavings. He has a 401(k) account with $2,000 to $3,000 on deposit. (Tr. 44.) By the time \n                                                 \n9 The account and file numbers on the money orders differ from the account numbers on Applicant\u2019s credit \nreport and are likely the numbers assigned by the collection attorney. The payment amounts indicate three \ndebts were being repaid on a monthly basis. The payments may pertain to four SOR allegations, however, if \nthe judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.j is a duplicate listing of SOR \u00b6 1.e. \n \n\n8 \n \nthe household expenses are paid, he and his spouse have little to nothing left over each \nmonth. (Tr. 45.) Applicant\u2019s spouse has not worked since 2010 or 2011, although she had \nsocial security disability income of $1,700 a month from at least 2013 through 2015.10 (Tr. \n76-77, 108.) They need his income to make payments on his past-due debts. (Tr. 85.) His \nspouse is looking for work. (Tr. 109.) Neither Applicant nor his spouse has not had any \nfinancial counseling. (Tr. 51, 117.) \n \n \nApplicant and his spouse have had marital difficulties since 2011 or 2012. She was \nunable to explain how Applicant spent his time because they have not seen each other \nmuch since he learned about her drug addiction and gambling. They have not divorced and \ncontinue to live in the same house for the sake of the children since 2011 or 2012, but he \nlives on the lower level. (Tr. 107.) She continues to handle the household finances. (Tr. 43, \n55.) The older of Applicant\u2019s and his spouse\u2019s two daughters is in college. She apparently \nfinished high school early and works two part-time jobs while going to school. Their son \nand younger daughter live at home. (Tr. 94.) Applicant bought a 2006 model-year vehicle \nfor $3,000 cash for his son but no other large purchases or vacations in the last three \nyears. (Tr. 45, 117.) He has opened no new credit card accounts. (GE 4.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \n                                                 \n10 Applicant\u2019s spouse testified that she applied for social security disability in 2010, but lost her disability \nbecause she stopped going to the doctor. (Tr. 78.) She apparently reapplied for disability income, given her \nsubsequent testimony that she received social security disability income of $1,700 per month for three years \nuntil 2016. (Tr. 108.)  \n\n9 \n \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility.   \n\n10 \n \nApplicant defaulted on seven credit card debts totaling approximately $32,831. Two \nof the debts, a credit card collection debt of $7,489 (SOR \u00b6 1.k) and a charged-off credit \ncard debt of $2,104 (SOR \u00b6 1.e, likely duplicated in SOR \u00b6 1.j) went to judgment. \nAdditionally, a $296 medical debt from July 2010 was placed for collection. As of June \n2017, a wireless telephone collection debt of $1,765 from May 2013 was still on his credit \nrecord. When he answered the SOR in January 2018, Applicant acknowledged his legal \nliability for all but the wireless phone debt and the medical debt. At his hearing, he was \napparently no longer disputing the medical debt because it had been incurred by him \nduring a lapse in his insurance coverage. However, although they had made some \npayments toward the delinquent credit card account in SOR \u00b6 1.c, neither he nor his \nspouse recalled him opening the account. His spouse testified to her belief the cell phone \naccount was opened fraudulently in her name by her sister, but that would not explain why \nit was reported on Applicant\u2019s credit record. \n \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.14 of the Directive, the government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish controverted facts.  The Appeal Board held in ISCR Case No. 08-\n12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010) that a credit report is sufficient to meet the \ngovernment\u2019s burden of producing evidence of delinquency: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for the \ndebt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \nApplicant or his spouse on his behalf had asked the cell phone provider to validate \nthe debt. Equifax was no longer reporting the debt on his credit record as of February \n2018. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most negative financial items from \na credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency or the debt becoming \ncollection barred because of a state statute of limitations, whichever is longer.11 Debts may \nbe dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going \nto be paid or when the debt has been charged off. The mere fact that debts have been \ndeleted from a credit report does not necessarily mean that they were not owed at one \ntime. Even assuming that the debt was erroneously reported on Applicant\u2019s credit, the \nevidence of consumer credit card delinquency is sufficient to establish disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations.\u201d  \n \nApplicant is not required to be debt free, but he is required to manage his finances \nin a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The burden is on Applicant to \nmitigate the evidence of financial delinquency. One or more of the following conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 20 may apply: \n                                                 \n11 Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission website, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act \nUpdates at Section 605, https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reportingact.pdf.   \n  \n\n11 \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) has some applicability in that most of the credit card debts became \nseriously delinquent in 2013. The medical debt from 2010 was not paid because Applicant \nand his spouse mistakenly assumed that it should have been covered by insurance. The \nAppeal Board recently affirmed that unresolved debts are a continuing course of conduct. \nSee ISCR Case No. 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-\n08799 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2017)). As of March 2018, only the medical debt had been \npaid. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not fully apply because most of his delinquent debts have not been \nresolved. \n \nApplicant has a case for some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). Applicant\u2019s financial \ndelinquencies were caused by a combination of circumstances, some of which were not \nwithin his control. His spouse started gambling in 2005 without his knowledge. She had \nemployment income, but also withdrew 401(k) assets to fund her gambling in 2007, which \nled to an unexpected significant tax lien filed in January 2011. His spouse\u2019s third car \naccident, which occurred in 2010, had a negative impact on their finances because she \nwas unable to return to work. Then, in September 2011, Applicant\u2019s sister unexpectedly \ndied in a car accident. Applicant and his spouse provided some financial support for his \nsister\u2019s children even though he was unemployed. \n \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside of his control, I have to consider whether Applicant acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with his financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-\n11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May \n\n12 \n \n25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether Applicant maintained contact with \nhis creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. Despite \nlearning about his spouse\u2019s gambling and opiate addiction in 2011 or 2012, Applicant did \nnot take over handling the household finances from his spouse. Applicant knowingly \nincurred much of his credit card debt in remodeling the house that his parents purchased in \nMarch 2012. He may not have known about the details of his accounts, but he had enough \nreason to question whether his spouse was paying them, given her admitted gambling \nproblem and his lack of any employment income. It cannot be determined that he acted \nfully responsibly toward his creditors without some proof that he made reasonable efforts to \nkeep himself apprised of his financial obligations. Applicant was unable or unwilling to \nprovide details about his debts during his subject interview in February 2017. Some doubt \nabout his financial judgment also arises because he gave priority to purchasing a car for \n$3,000 for his son (now 17 years old) without ensuring that his own credit obligations were \nbeing repaid. \n \nApplicant is credited with working almost every day from October 2016 until January \n2018 for the income needed to support his family and address his past-due debts. \nApplicant presented evidence of wage garnishment at $75 a week, which went toward the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Available credit reports show that the $12,311 charged-off balance had \nbeen reduced to $7,925 as of the last garnishment of his wages in December 2017. The \nrepayment through garnishment is not considered completely voluntary because Applicant \nagreed to it in response to court action from the creditor, but it is evidence showing that the \ndebt was in the process of being resolved under AG \u00b6 20(c) until Applicant lost his job. AG \n\u00b6 20(c) and \u00b6 20(d) have some applicability because of the payments at $75 a month from \nJune 2017 to January 2018 toward three other delinquent credit card debts, and his \napparent satisfaction of the $296 medical debt. Those efforts at repayment commenced six \nmonths before the issuance of the SOR, although after Applicant had been interviewed by \nthe OPM investigator and was on notice that his delinquent accounts were of concern to \nthe DOD. Applicant presented no evidence of any payments on the judgment debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.k before December 14, 2017. He did not provide an explanation that could reasonably \njustify the delay in addressing that debt. He had made only one payment, in December \n2016, toward the charged-off debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b and no payments toward the charged-off \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.d. Applicant did not provide a record of consistent repayment to apply AG \n\u00b6 20(c) or AG \u00b6 20(d) to those debts. Applicant has not had the financial counseling \ncontemplated within AG \u00b6 20(c). \n \nApplicant is not required to pay off every one of his past-due debts before he can be \ngranted security clearance eligibility. Yet, he is in a difficult situation financially in that his \nunemployment compensation does not provide him the income to continue to make \npayments on his delinquencies. Due to interest on unpaid balances, he owed more than \n$28,000 in past-due credit card debt as of March 2018. He has not presented the \ndocumentation required under AG \u00b6 20(e) to disprove his liability for the wireless telephone \ndebt or the credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. AG \u00b6 20(e) may have some limited applicability in \nthat the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.j is likely the same debt as the credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nWhile his monthly payments on some debts from June 2017 to January 2018 suggest that \n\n13 \n \nhe will resume his payments on those debts if he had the income to do so, little progress \nhad been made toward his other debts. He has yet to demonstrate that he can handle his \nfinances fully responsibly. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). It is not a proceeding designed to \ncollect debts. However, Applicant raised doubts about his financial judgment and \nwillingness to comply with his obligations by not keeping himself adequately apprised of his \ndelinquencies. The Government chose to not pursue the issue of whether Applicant \ndeliberately falsified his SF 86. Applicant may not have known the details of his consumer \ncredit delinquencies as of his interview in February 2017, but he knew or should have \nknown that his wages were being garnished at $75 a week to repay his largest credit card \ndelinquency. It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Applicant\u2019s \nevidence falls short of dispelling the security concerns raised by his inattention to or \ndisregard of his financial matters. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:   \n \n \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nWITHDRAWN \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \n\n14 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nHistory of Case\nOn January 31, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated\nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons\nwhy DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine\nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The\naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or) 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National Security\nAdjudicative Guidelines (SEAD) 4), effective June 8, 2017.\n03/14/2019\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on February 15, 2018, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on August 3, 2018, and was scheduled for hearing on\nOctober 30, 2018. A hearing was convened as scheduled, for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny,\nor revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted\nof four exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (herself) and one exhibit. The transcript\n(Tr.) was received on November 7, 2018.\nBesides its four exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of\ndetailed facts taken from 14 U.S. Government official publications. Administrative or\nofficial notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. See\nISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 2007);  Administrative notice is appropriate for\nnoticing facts or government reports that are well known. See Stein, Administrative Law,\nSec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006). For good cause shown, administrative notice was\ngranted with respect to the above-named background reports containing the identified\nfacts in Department Counsel\u2019s Request for Administration Notice regarding the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China (PRC) that address the geopolitical situation in the PRC.\nAdministrative Notice was extended to the documents themselves, consistent  with the\nprovisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evid. This notice did not foreclose Applicant from\nchallenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the reports\naddressing Hong Kong\u2019s current state. Department Counsel\u2019s Administrative Notice\nRequest was received as HE 1.\nIn addition to the source documents covered by Department Counsel\u2019s\nAdministrative Notice Request, I took official notice of Background Note: Hong Kong\nSAR, U.S. Department of State (December 2007). This document was received as HE 2.\nProcedural Rulings \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\npermit her the opportunity to supplement the record with pertinent information about U.S.\nrelations with Hong Kong. For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 10 days to\nsupplement the record. Department Counsel was afforded three days to respond.  Within\nthe time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with citations to web-sites\naddressing U.S. Relations with Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Policy Act Report, and U.S.\nTrade in Goods with Hong Kong. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions (three in all) were\nadmitted without objection as AEs B-D .\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged to have (a) parents who are dual citizens of\nHong Kong and the United States who reside in Hong Kong; (b) a stepfather who is a\ncitizen and resident  of Hong Kong; and (c) a mother-in-law who is a dual citizen of Hong\nKong and the United States.  \n2\n\nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant, admitted that her mother is a dual citizen of\nHong Kong and the United States who resides in Hong Kong, but denied that her father is\na dual citizen of Hong Kong and the United States who resides in Hong Kong, claiming he\nis a citizen and resident of Hong Kong. She admitted that her stepfather is a citizen and\nresident of Hong Kong, but denied that her mother-in-law is a dual citizen of the United\nStates, claiming she is a citizen and resident of Hong Kong.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 40-year-old digital electronics engineer employed by a defense\ncontractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and\nadmitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings\nfollow.\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant was born and raised in Hong Kong to parents of Chinese descent. After\nfinishing her high school education in Hong Kong, she immigrated to the U.S. in\nNovember 1997 at the age of 19 to pursue her education. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 35-36, 55-56, 60-\n62)  Before Hong Kong\u2019s reversion to the PRC in July 1997, Applicant and her family\nmembers were citizens of the British Colony of Hong Kong.  British culture and capitalism\nwere major influences on Applicant in her formative years. Mainland China and the\nCommunist Party played no part in her family upbringing. \nUpon her arrival in the United States, she enrolled in a local community college\nwith the academic objective of pursuing an engineering curricula. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 62-63)\nShe earned an associate\u2019s degree in June 2000 before transferring to a respected state\nuniversity. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in June 2003\nand was awarded a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from the same university in\nJune 2004. (GE 2; Tr. 63-64) She reported no U.S. military service. \nSince 2016, Applicant has worked for her current employer. (GEs 1-2 and AE A;\nTr. 42-43, 46-48, 73-74) Between 2005 and 2016, she worked for another defense\ncontractor. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 43-46) Between November 1997 and April 2005, she was\nemployed by other employers in assorted capacities. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 68) Applicant was \nnaturalized as a U.S. citizen in May 2003 and received her U.S. passport in June 2004.\n(GEs 1-3) In February 2005, she applied for and received a Chinese passport. (Tr. 66)\nOnce she began working for her prior defense contractor employer, she returned her\nChinese passport. (Tr. 67)\nApplicant is married and has two children (ages seven and nine) from this\nmarriage.  (GEs 1-4; Tr. 41, 43, 48-49, 70-71)  For most of the past 21 years of her\nresidency in the United States before her marriage, she lived alone and described herself\nas self-sufficient. (GEs 1-4) \n3\n\nApplicant\u2019s immediate family members include her mother (a dual citizen of the\nPRC and the United States) and father (a citizen of the PRC and resident of Hong Kong).\nExtended family members include her stepfather (a citizen of the PRC and resident of\nHong Kong) and her mother-in-law (a citizen of the PRC and resident of Hong Kong).\n(GEs 1-3; Tr. 37, 40) Her parents, stepfather, and mother-in-law are dual citizens of Great\nBritain and the PRC by virtue of their birth in Hong Kong and unilateral declaration by the\nPRC that persons who are of Chinese descent and who were born in the mainland China\nor Hong Kong are PRC citizens. See Background Note: Hong Kong SAR, supra. \nApplicant\u2019s father is a retired accountant (not affiliated with the Hong Kong or PRC\ngovernment); while her mother is a homemaker. (Tr. 110) Applicant\u2019s mother owns a\nsmall apartment in Hong Kong; while her father owns no property in Hong Kong. (Tr. 103-\n104) \nApplicant also has three sisters. Two reside in the United States, and the third\nsister resides in Scotland. (Tr. 54) While in college, Applicant traveled on several\noccasions to Hong Kong to visit her parents and other family members (2005-2011), with\nher last trip occurring in 2011. (GEs 1-3; Tr. 36-37, 90-92, 95) Applicant maintains little\ncontact with her father, but has regular telephone contact with her mother (Tr. 103-107)\nand periodic contact with her other family members. (Tr. 103, 107) Her mother-in-law has\nvisited Applicant and her husband to see their children, and stayed with them on each\nvisit. (Tr. 79-81)\nApplicant has not been involved in any embarrassing or compromising incidents\noverseas, and has not engaged in any illegal activities (GEs 1-4) She provides no\nfinancial  assistance to any of her family members (who are self-sufficient), or to anyone\nor any entity outside the United States.  (Tr. 105-108) She has never served in a foreign\nmilitary; nor is she willing to do so. (GEs 1-3) She has had no contact with any foreign\ngovernment representatives or organizations since residing in the United States.  She has\nno financial interests or obligations in Hong Kong. (GEs 3-4) She has no property\nownership, no foreign bank accounts, no retirement, medical, or education benefits in\nHong Kong, and no social security or any other received government benefit from Hong\nKong or any other foreign country. (GEs 1-4) \nApplicant has never had any foreign property confiscated, and she has never\nsponsored any foreign nationals to the United States. (GEs 1-4). Nor has she ever voted\nor sought political office in Hong Kong or any foreign country. Further, she has not\nperformed or attempted to perform duties that could serve the interests of Hong Kong or\nany foreign government. \nBy contrast, Applicant has held jobs in the United States for over 20 years and\nowns property in the United States.  She considers herself a fully assimilated U.S. citizen\n(GEs 1-4) and professes no allegiance, preference, sympathies or alliances with any\nperson or entity or government in the PRC, or anywhere else (GEs 1-4) She fully\nunderstands the importance of reporting any and all foreign travel to her employer\u2019s\nsecurity officials. \n4\n\nCharacter references\nApplicant is highly regarded by her supervisor. (AE A) Her supervisor with her\ncurrent employer characterizes her work as excellent in quality. The supervisor considers\nApplicant to be honest, polite, respectful, and very responsible. (AE A)\nHong Kong\u2019s historical background\nHong Kong\u2019s history dates back over five millennia. It developed strong trading\nrelationships with Britain in 1842 (following the First Opium War) under the Treaty of\nNanking. See Background Note: Hong Kong SAR, supra, at 2). Britain was granted a\nperpetual lease on the Kowloon Peninsula under the 1860 Convention of Beijing, and\nBritain expanded its control over the surrounding area under a 99-year lease of the New\nTerritories in 1898. See id. \nIn the late 19  and early 20  centuries, Hong Kong developed as a warehousing\nth\nth\nand distribution center for British trade with southern China. See Background Note: Hong\nKong SAR, supra). Heavy migration to Hong Kong occurred after the Communist\ntakeover of mainland China in 1949. Hong Kong achieved considerable economic\nsuccess as a British colony in the post-1949 period as a manufacturing, commercial,\nfinance, and tourism center.  High life expectancies, literacy, per capita income, and a\nconfluence of other socioeconomic indicators serve to illustrate Hong Kong\u2019s measurable\nsocioeconomic achievements.\nHong Kong\u2019s reversion\nSince July 1, 1997, Hong Kong has been a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of\nthe PRC. This is important to note because of the generally recognized heightened risks\nthat are associated with the PRC, and the unilaterally imposed citizenship and residency\nstatus on Applicant and her parents as birth residents and citizens of Hong Kong before\nthe reversion. See Background Note: Hong Kong SAR, supra. This does not mean that\nthe U.S. Government will not offer consular services to dual nationals who use their non-\nU.S. passports in Hong Kong and other sectors of the PRC. But because the PRC does\nnot recognize dual citizenship under its nationality law, use of other than a U.S. passport\nto enter China can simply increase the difficulties of consular assistance for any dual\nnational who is arrested under such circumstances. See id.. Due to Applicant\u2019s returning\nher  Chinese passport to the PRC shortly after going to work for her previous employer in\n2005, this feature of PRC law has no application to Applicant.  \nHong Kong today has a population of over 7 million (95 per cent of which are\nChinese), and is one of the most densely populated regions of the world. China has given\nHong Kong considerable autonomy over its domestic affairs. The PRC has retained\nresponsibility and control over foreign and defense affairs. State Department records\nconfirm that the PRC has taken an increasingly active oversight role over Hong Kong\u2019s\npolitical developments. See  Background Note: Hong Kong SAR, supra, at 2-3.\n5\n\nStill, both the Sino-British joint declaration (1984) and the Basic Law provide\npolitical safeguards to ensure that Hong Kong retains its own political, economic, and\njudicial systems and unique status for at least 50 years after reversion. These legal\ndocuments permit Hong Kong to continue to participate in international conventions and\norganizations under the name of \u201cHong Kong, China. See Background Note: Hong Kong\nSAR, supra, at 2. Hong Kong, with its quasi autonomy, remains a free and open society\nwhere human rights are respected, courts are independent, and there are established\ntraditions of respect for the rule of law. See id, at 3.  Hong Kong continues to retain a\ncommon law system from its time as a British colony before 1997 and maintains\nextradition agreements with more than a dozen countries, including the United States, the\nUnited Kingdom, and Singapore. The PRC, by contrast, operates a civil-law system.\nCitizens of Hong Kong are limited, however, in their ability to change their\ngovernment, and the legislature is limited in its power to change government policies. \nSee Background Note: Hong Kong SAR, supra. And the PRC still retains oversight and\nultimate veto authority over all of Hong Kong\u2019s economic and political decision making. \nAny changes in Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law (such as to achieve full universal suffrage) will\nrequire approval by Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, at least a two thirds approval by the\nLegislative Counsel (Legco), and then the PRC\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress Standing\nCommittee (NPSCS), which is by no means assured. See id. \nBecause Applicant\u2019s parents, stepfather, and mother-in-law are still citizens and\nresidents of Hong Kong with unilaterally imposed Chinese citizenship by the PRC\u2019s\nimmigration law, the PRC\u2019s system, its respect for human rights and the rule of law, and\nits collection activities that extend throughout its maintained intelligence operations in\nHong Kong and Macau, become quite relevant to evaluating any potential security risks\nassociated with Applicant\u2019s parents and extended family members. Concerns are also\nextended to limitations on freedom of the press and expression, academic freedom,\narbitrary detention, aggressive police tactics that hamper freedom, trafficking in persons,\nand societal prejudice against certain ethnic minorities. See id., at 3-4. \nUnited States-Hong Kong Relations\nHong Kong, as a Special Administrative Region of the PRC, who bears full\nresponsibility for its foreign relations and defense, is a customs territory and economic\nsector that operates separately from the rest of the PRC in matters that pertain to its\ncustoms zone. See U.S. Relations with Hong Kong, U.S. Dept. of State (July 2018).(AE\nB) Operating in its sphere of reserved authority, it is able to enter into international\nagreements on its own behalf in commercial, economic, and in certain legal areas. See id.\nU.S. policy toward Hong Kong is set forth in the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act of\n1992 (Policy Act), whose stated purpose is to promote Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity,\nautonomy, and way of life. See Hong Kong Policy Act Report, U.S. Dept. of State (May\n2018). (AE D);  U.S. Relations with Hong Kong, supra.  Under the Policy Act, the United\nStates supports Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy under the \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201d\nframework by concluding and implementing bilateral agreements; promoting trade and\n6\n\ninvestment; broadening law enforcement cooperation, pursuing educational, academic,\nand cultural ties, supporting high-level visits of U.S. officials; and serving the large\ncommunity of U.S. firms, residents, and visitors. See id; U.S. Relations with Hong Kong,\nsupra. Hong Kong\u2019s one country, two systems framework was established in the Basic\nLaw of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the PRC, as enacted by the\nNational People\u2019s Congress. See id. The Act establishes the policy of the U.S.\ngovernment to treat Hong Kong as a non-sovereign entity distinct from China for the\npurposes of U.S. domestic law, based on the principles of the 1984 Sin-British Joint\nDeclaration. (id.)\nHong Kong is active in counter-terrorism and counter-proliferation initiatives and\nremains an important partner in efforts to eliminate funding for terrorist networks, exact\nstrategic trade controls, and combat money laundering. See U.S. Relations with Hong\nKong, supra; Hong Kong Policy Act Report, supra, at 2-5. In March 2014, Hong Kong\npassed legislation allowing it to adopt the most recent globally recognized standards for\nexchange of tax information, and both countries have since concluded an international\ngovernmental agreement under the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. See id. \nCurrently, the United States maintains a strong trade surplus with Hong Kong. In\n2018, it had a trade surplus of $32.6 billion in 2017 and 31,14, billion in 2018, which\nrepresent the largest single trade surpluses of any U.S. trading partner. See id; Trade in\nGoods with Hong Kong, U.S. Dept. of Commerce (March 2019). (AE C); Hong Kong\nPolicy Act Report, supra, at. 2. Trade balance reports confirm that two-way trade in goods\nand services totaled an estimated $68.9 billion in 2017. (id.) U.S. exports of goods and\nservices to Hong Kong in 2015 are reported to have supported an estimated 188,000 U.S.\njobs (latest data available), all based on free market principles. (id.)\nHong Kong is a major participant in international organizations. See U.S. Relations\nwith Hong Kong, supra, at 2. Both the United States and Hong Kong belong to the World\nTrade Organization, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and Financial Action Task\nForce.  Hong Kong remains an effective champion of free markets and the reduction of\ntrade barriers. See id; Hong Kong Policy Act Report, supra, at 2-3.\nThe PRC\u2019s country status\nEstablished in 1949, the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) with over 1.3 billion\npeople is the world\u2019s most populous country. Today it continues to undergo rapid\neconomic and social change. Political power, however, remains centralized in the\nChinese Communist Party (CCP) with little indication of any change in the foreseeable\nfuture. The PRC, with its 70.8 million square miles of land space, is authoritarian in\nstructure and ideology and possesses increasingly sophisticated military forces which\ncontinues to transform itself from a land-based military power to a smaller, more mobile,\nhigh tech military that eventually will be capable of mounting limited operations beyond its\ncoastal waters. See Background Note: China, supra, at 14-16. \n7\n\nWhile not a country acclaimed to be hostile to U.S. persons and interests, the PRC\nmaintains a relationship that is more competitive than cooperative. The PRC operates a\nlarge and sophisticated intelligence bureau, entitled the Ministry of State Security (MSS)\nThese operations use clandestine agents to collect intelligence on Western consortia\ninvesting in the PRC who are suspected of involvement in attempts to democratize the\nPRC, as well as other pro-democracy groups thought to be engaging in anti-communist\nactivities. See Administrative Notice, supra, at 4; Annual Report to Congress: Military and\nSecurity Developments Involving the People\u2019s Republic of China, at 59, 65, 71, U.S. Dept.\nof Defense (2017)\nBased on past reports to Congress, the PRC is considered one of the most active\ncollectors of U.S. economic and proprietary information. See Administrative Notice, supra,\nat 3-4; Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage\n2009-2011 at 2-3, Office of National Counterintelligence Executive (Oct. 2011) the PRC\nuses its intelligence services to gather information about the US and to obtain advanced\ntechnologies. See id. The PRC actively monitors international communications satellites\nfrom maintained intercept facilities, in addition to collecting information on US military\noperations and exercises.  Examples of PRC economic espionage are cited in the Annual\nReport to Congress from the National Counterintelligence Executive on Economic\nCollection, 2005-2006, supra, at 10-12. Most of the examples of illegally exported\ntechnology to the PRC involved high tech equipment and devices used in missile and\naircraft guidance systems, highly sensitive weapons parts, infrared cameras and missile\nmicrochips. See case illustrations cited in Administrative Notice, supra, at 7-8; Summary\nof Major U.S. Enforcement, Economic Espionage, and Sanctions-Related Criminal Cases,\nU.S. Dept. of Justice at 14-15 (Jan. 2018).\nAs a corollary of its authoritarian roots, the PRC has never been known for a\npositive human rights record among Western nations and international human rights\ngroups. Part of this can be explained in terms of the PRC\u2019s lack of any cognizable\ntradition for respect for developing democracies and the rule of law. State Department\ncountry reports on the PRC cite the country\u2019s poor human rights record.  Its noted\nhistorical abuses include the suppression of political dissent, arbitrary arrest and\ndetention, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners. See Administrative\nNotice, supra, at 8-9; 2017 Human rights Report: China (includes Tibet, Hong Kong, and\nMacau), U.S. Department of State (April 2018).\nOf growing concern to U.S. security interests are the State Department\u2019s latest \nreports of increased high profile cases in the PRC involving the monitoring, harassment,\ndetention, arrest, and imprisonment of journalists, writers, activists, and defense lawyers\nseeking to exercise their law-protected rights. See Administrative Notice, supra, at 9;\nInternational Travel, Country Information-China International Travel Information, U.S.\nDepartment of State (Jan. 2018) The State Department cites a comprehensive, credible\naccounting of all those killed, missing, or detained, reported incidents of deaths in custody,\ndisappearance, torture, and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.\nSee id.\n8\n\nIn its November 2016 Report to Congress, the Security Review Commission\ndescribed the PRC as a country intent on acquiring and exploiting the knowledge\ndeveloped by multiples of collection agents: legally, if possible, and otherwise illegally by\nespionage. Administrative Notice, supra, at 7; 2016 Report to Congress of the U.S.-China\nEconomic and Security Review Commission at 293, 297 (Nov. 2016). The PRC\u2019s\nconcerted efforts to acquire sensitive technology poses a considerable challenge to U.S.\ncounterintelligence measures.  Recent indictments of Chinese citizens for espionage have\nserved to highlight the PRC\u2019s spying activities in the U.S. See Administrative Notice,\nsupra, at 6-7; Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review\nCommission, supra. Better U.S. export controls can be effective only if they are multilateral\nin scope. See id. Without effective dual use export controls in place, the PRC can be\nexpected to acquire dual use technologies with military potential through the U.S. and\nother source countries. \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\nadministrative judges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases.  These\nGuidelines require the administrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and\nall of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the\nadministrative judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In\naddition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, administrative judges must take into\naccount the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in\nE.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to\nassist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy\nfactors are pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests, including, but not limited\nto, business, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern\nif they result in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security\nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of\nforeign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the\nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited, considerations\nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or\n9\n\nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.  See \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG), \u00b6 6.\n      Burden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue  \nApplicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a  threshold finding that\nto do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nadministrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in\nthe record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance\ndepends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all\nadversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot\ndraw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: It must prove any controverted fact[s]\nalleged in the Statement of Reasons, and it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a\nmaterial bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The\nrequired showing of material bearing, however, does not require the Government to\naffirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified\ninformation before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must\ntake account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nsafeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis\nApplicant was born in Hong Kong to parents of Chinese descent and traces her\nBritish heritage through Hong Kong\u2019s historical colonial links with Britain. She  immigrated\nto the U.S. in November 1997 for educational reasons. She earned associates, bachelors,\nand master degrees in the United States in electrical engineering and became a U.S.\ncitizen in 2003. Applicant is a highly regarded digital electronics engineer for a U.S.\ndefense contractor.  \nSecurity issues of concern to the Government focus on the citizenship and\nresidence status of immediate family members (her parents) and extended family\nmembers (her stepfather and mother-in-law) in Hong Kong following its reversion to the\nPRC in 1997, a country known for its poor human rights record and its engagement in\neconomic data collection throughout the PRC (inclusive of Hong Kong) and the United\nStates. \n10\n\nForeign influence concerns\nThe Government urges security concerns over risks that Applicant\u2019s immediate and\nextended family members (her  parents, stepfather, and mother-in-law) that reside in Hong\nKong (which has since reverted to the PRC) might be subject to undue foreign influence by\nPRC authorities to access classified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control. \nBecause Applicant and her family members who have PRC citizenship by virtue of Hong\nKong\u2019s reversion to the PRC in 1997, they present potential heightened security risks\ncovered by Disqualifying Condition (DC) \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a\nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d of the Adjudication\nGuidelines for foreign influence. \nThe citizenship/residence status of Applicant\u2019s parents and extended family\nmembers in what is now the PRC poses some potential concerns for Applicant because of\nthe risks of undue foreign influence that could compromise classified information under\nApplicant's possession and/or control.  DC \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s\nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s\ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information,\u201d has\npossible application due to the  presence of Applicant\u2019s parents, stepfather, and mother-in-\nlaw in Hong Kong (a part of the PRC since its reversion in 1997). While Applicant has not\nvisited any of her family residing in Hong Kong since 2011, and has no financial interests\nor property in Hong Kong or the PRC that could create potential conflicts of interest, she\ndoes maintain frequent telephone contact with them.\nApplicant and her family have deep roots in Hong Kong (for years a British colony)\nand are steeped in British culture, free markets, democratic government, human rights\nprotections, and respect for the rule of law. Applicant herself has no contacts with PRC\nofficials or interests in the PRC.\nFrom what is known from the presented evidence, none of Applicant\u2019s immediate or\nextended family members residing in Hong Kong have any political affiliations with the\nHong Kong or PRC governing bodies. Nor do any of her family members residing in Hong\nKong have any history to date of being subjected to any coercion or influence, or appear to\nbe vulnerable to the same. \nThe citizenship status and presence in Hong Kong of Applicant\u2019s parents,\nstepfather, and mother-in-law pose some risk because of Hong Kong\u2019s reversion to the\nPRC and the latter\u2019s sovereign oversight powers over all of Hong Kong\u2019s domestic affairs,\nand plenary responsibility over its external  affairs.  Ths risks are minimal, though, and are\nreconcilable with U.S. security interests. Applicant\u2019s contacts with her family members  are\nmore than neutralized by the former\u2019s demonstrated strong loyalties to the United States\n11\n\nand manifest commitments to protect this country\u2019s security interests and resist any family\npressures that could weaken her fiducial duties to protecting classified information.\nAlthough the United States and the PRC are global competitors, and the PRC is an\nactive collector of protected information, Applicant is not in a position where she could be\npotentially vulnerable to pressure or coercion. Considering that Hong Kong generally\nrespects human rights of its citizens and the rule of law, the risk that the PRC might seek\nprotected information-or succeed in obtaining that information-from Applicant or her family\nmembers remains low.   \nThe Adjudicative Guidelines governing security clearances do not dictate per se\nresults or mandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are\ncitizens/residents of foreign countries in general.  What is considered to be an acceptable\nrisk in one foreign country may not be in another.  While foreign influence cases must by\npractical necessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for\nreferencing in the supplied materials and country information about Hong Kong. \nThe AGs do take into account the  country\u2019s demonstrated relations with the U.S.\nas an important consideration in gauging whether the particular relatives with citizenship\nand residency elsewhere create a heightened security risk. The geopolitical aims and\npolicies of the particular foreign regime involved do matter. \nAs for security concerns associated with the presence of Applicant's parents and\nextended family members residing in Hong Kong (a Chinese sector that continues in a\nsemi-autonomous way despite its reversion to the PRC), any potential heightened risk of a\nhostage situation or undue foreign influence brought in the hopes of eliciting either\nclassified information or economic or proprietary data out of Applicant through her parents\nand other family members residing in Hong Kong is minimal. \n Applicant, accordingly, may take advantage of one important mitigating condition:\nMC \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the persons or activities of these persons in that country are such\nthat it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the United States.\u201d Hong Kong, with its quasi autonomy, remains a free and\nopen society where human rights are respected, courts are independent and operate\nunder the sector\u2019s inherited British common law, and there are established traditions of\nrespect for the rule of law. True, citizens of Hong Kong are limited in their ability to change\ntheir government, and the legislature is limited in its power to change government policies.\nAnd the PRC still retains oversight and ultimate veto authority over all of Hong Kong\u2019s\neconomic and political decision making. But since reversion, the PRC has essentially left\nHong Kong to manage its own internal affairs without any interference from PRC\nauthorities. This deference is not expected to materially change in the foreseeable future.\nAnd in the hypothetical situation where Applicant\u2019s parents or any of her family members\nresiding in Hong Kong or the United States were to be pressured, Applicant\u2019s strong\n12\n\nloyalties and security commitments to the United States make it very unlikely that she\nwould permit herself to be pressured into compromising classified information.   \nOf full benefit to Applicant is MC 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because\nthe individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and\nloyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest\nin favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s demonstrated loyalty, patriotism, and professional\ncommitments to the United States are well demonstrated and enough under these\ncircumstances to neutralize all potential conflicts that are implicit in her relationships with\nher parents and extended family members.\nWhole-person assessment\nWhole person assessment also serves to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure to potential\nconflicts of interests with her parents and extended family members residing in Hong\nKong. Not only has Applicant become a naturalized U.S. citizen and received her\nadvanced degrees in the United States, but she has made every effort to work, save, and\npursue her financial interests exclusively in the United States. Applicant is highly regarded\nand trusted by her supervisor who regularly interfaces with her. Her supervisor  expressed\nno awareness of any risks of coercion, pressure, or influence that any of her parents or\nother family members might be exposed to.  \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, any likelihood of coercion, pressure, or influence being brought\nto bear on her parents and extended family members would appear to be minimal.  By all\nreasonable accounts of the presented record,  Applicant has no visible conflicts of interest\nwith Hong Kong and the PRC or property interests in China that could be at risk to\nexploitation or compromise by Hong Kong government authorities or PRC military or\nintelligence officials.  \nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's parents and\nextended family members residing in Hong Kong are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe\npredictive judgments about her ability to withstand risks of undue influence attributable to\nher familial relationships in Hong Kong (now part of the PRC). Her demonstrated loyalties\nand commitments to protecting U.S. security interests, make it highly unlikely she would\nsuccumb to any foreign influence brought to bear on herself or her family members by\nPRC government or military officials. Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by Guideline B.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\n13\n\nGUIDELINE B: (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\n      FOR APPLICANT\n  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.d:\n      For Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance.  \nClearance is granted.\n                                  \nRoger C.

She provided a post-hearing letter from \nthe Department of the Treasury indicating that Applicant\u2019s IRS tax refund was withheld \nin the amount of $2,294 to apply to her DOE delinquencies. (AE B). Otherwise, she \nhasn\u2019t paid on her student loans for seven years. (Tr. 26) \n \nApplicant testified that when she left her husband in 2016, she had $30 in her \nbank account and she was earning very little. When she returned to the work force in \n2012, she was earning $250 every two weeks.

Applicant testified that the \nchild\u2019s father is supposed to pay for half of these medical expenses, but he has not \ndone so. (Tr. 29) He does send her $417 each month for child support. (Tr. 30) SOR \u00b6 \n1.n is an insurance debt that she contends should have been paid by her ex-husband. \nShe claims she removed herself from the insurance policy when they split. (Tr. 30) \nSimilarly, SOR \u00b6 1.f was for cable television that should be paid by her ex-husband \nsince he supposedly kept the cable boxes.

All of her delinquent debts are listed in her credit reports.  \n \nApplicant testified that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.r is for a bank credit card she \nused, and she is working on a payment plan. (Tr. 34) She provided no documents to \nsubstantiate her payment plan. Applicant testified that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.v through 1.z all relate \nto delinquent debts or judgment (1.x), which she does not deny owing, but disputes with \nher ex-husband about who owes this debt. (Tr.36-38) She plans to satisfy all of her \ndelinquent debts in the future. (Tr. 37) She provided post-hearing documents showing a \npayment made on March 28, 2018, in the amount of $149 on her federal student loans, \nand another one due on April 19, 2018 (AE A); and another document advising her to \ncontinue her $5 per month payments to the collection agency for DOE, but her payment \nplan expires June 4, 2018. (AE C) She also produced a student loan rehabilitation \npacket showing that due to her increased annual salary, her DOE monthly payments \nincreased from $25 per month to $232 per month as of May 2018. (AE D)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues started when she was out of the work force for four \nyears caring for her sick daughter. Her problems worsened when she left her ex-\nhusband and disputed with him many of their jointly held debts in 2016. Before that, she \nwas diagnosed with a serious illness ten years ago. (Tr. 43) It is now in remission. \nApplicant has not had debt consolidation services or financial counseling. (Tr. 40) She \ndoes claim to have a budget, but it was not provided. Applicant stated her plan going \nforward is to address the larger delinquencies first and resolve those. She has not \nprovided documentary evidence of a continuous stream of payments to establish a track \nrecord of repayments on any of her delinquent debts.  \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n                                             \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b618:  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal acts to generate funds. \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following \napply here:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n           (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant admitted to most of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. All are \nsupported by her credit reports. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of \nthe above disqualifying conditions.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control, (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n \n (c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the  \n \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit  \n\n \n6 \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant has not resolved, or entered into a payment plan to resolve any of the \nalleged delinquent debts except for the student loans. She testified about a \nrehabilitation plan and provided evidence that she entered into one during the month \nbefore her hearing. It is too soon to conclude that she is making a continuous stream of \nmonthly payments in the amount of $232. She failed to take action on these delinquent \nstudent loans for over seven years. Applicant\u2019s eleventh hour efforts to enter into a \nstudent loan rehabilitation plan are too little, too late. \n \n \nApplicant had compelling family and economic circumstances that explained \nsome of her financial problems, including her ex-husband\u2019s low paying job, and caring \nfor her daughter. These were factors beyond her control. She has since done little to \ncontact creditors and to make payment arrangements. She disputes many of these just \ndebts with her ex-husband, but acknowledges this is a private dispute. She repeatedly \nexpressed her intent to resolve her debts at some future date. She has not followed \nthrough with a demonstrated track record of consistent payments pursuant to \ninstallment plans with her creditors. She has demonstrated no viable plan going \nforward. Applicant has not acted responsibly. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c) and 20(d) do not \napply. I am not satisfied that her delinquent debts are being resolved.   \n \n \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \n\n \n7 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances remain a security concern. There are no indications that \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are under control. They are longstanding, going back \nover a decade, and continuing. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.aa:  \n           Against Applicant \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n  Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n                                                      Robert J.

They were incurred several years ago, \nbut they remain ongoing and unresolved. He did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the financial security concern. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 17, 2016. On \nMay 1, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations.1  \n1 The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016), \neffective June 8, 2017. \n02/27/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 2, 2018, and requested a hearing. The \ncase was assigned to me on November 16, 2018. On November 26, 2018, a notice of \nhearing was issued scheduling the hearing for December 10, 2018. The hearing \nconvened as scheduled. At the hearing, Department Counsel submitted Government\u2019s \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 5. Applicant testified but did not submit any exhibits. The \nhearing transcript (Tr.) was received on January 2, 2019.  \n \nAmendment to the SOR \n \n \nAt the start of the hearing, I amended the SOR to correct the spelling of one of \nthe words in the name of the creditor in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f, without objection. (Tr. \n15) \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.g. His admissions are incorporated into the \nfindings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 28 years old. He is a high school graduate. He has never married \nand he has no children. He served in the U.S. Navy from April 2010 to February 2012, \nwhen he received a general discharge under honorable conditions. (Tr. 33-34; GE 1) \n \n \nWhen Applicant was a junior sailor, he was walking on base one evening, and \nsaw a debit card lying on the ground. He picked it up, and instead of turning it in to \nauthorities, he used it for his own expenses, such as gas and utilities. He charged about \n$230 on the card before he was caught. (Tr. 31, 75-77; GE 5 at 6)  \n \n \nSoon thereafter, Applicant was interviewed by the Navy Criminal Investigative \nService (NCIS). He was charged with violating Article 121 of the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice (larceny and wrongful appropriation), was referred to Captain\u2019s Mast, \nwhere he received non-judicial punishment of 45 days restriction and 45 days extra \nduty, and reduced in rank. A few months later, he was notified that he was being given a \ngeneral discharge under honorable conditions. (Tr. 33-36, 57-62; GE 1; GE 2) Applicant \npaid full restitution to the sailor whose debit card he misused.2 (Tr. 62, 77) \n \n \nAfter leaving the Navy, Applicant was briefly unemployed. He then worked odd \njobs from spring 2012 through the end of 2013. (Tr. 69) In January 2014, he was hired \nby a defense contractor. In October 2014, he took a job with the same employer in a \nnew state. He divided his time between the two locations until September 2017, when \nhe moved to the new state full time. (Tr. 69-72, 84-87) \n \n                                                          \n2 The debit card Applicant found was issued by the same institution that is the creditor for all but one of \nthe SOR debts, but none of them relate to that incident. (Tr. 75) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant worked in that position from October 2014 until June 2016, when he \nand many others were laid off. He then worked odd jobs until February 2018, when he \nwas rehired by his current employer and clearance sponsor. (Tr. 36-38, 54, 69, 84-87) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has about $17,000 in delinquent debt. Applicant \nincurred all of the debts during his time in the Navy, and all but one of the debts are to \nthe same creditor, a credit union. The debts are listed on Applicant\u2019s credit reports from \nJune 2016, November 2017, and December 2018. (GE 2, GE 3, GE 4) Applicant used \nloans to finance the purchase of two motorcycles and a used car, and also had other \nloans and credit cards. This includes SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($7,433), 1.b ($5,416), 1.c ($2,156), \n1.d ($1,153), 1.e ($552), and 1.f ($4,094). (Tr. 38-43, 77-79) The accounts remain on a \nrecent credit report. (GE 4) \n \n \nIn about 2012, Applicant received an e-mail on his military e-mail account \nconcerning an overseas job offer. He applied for the job, but was soon asked to send \nmoney to the sender. This was a scam, as Applicant belatedly realized, but not before \nhe took out another loan (SOR \u00b6 1.f) to pay for it. (Tr. 40-43)  \n \n \nApplicant fell behind on his various accounts, and they were charged off or \nplaced for collection. He later spoke to someone at the credit union in an attempt to \nsettle his accounts, but took no further action to resolve them. (Tr. 43-49) As he \ntestified, \u201cI didn\u2019t deal with it for so long that it was like, you just start new.\u201d (Tr. 80) He \nhas not reached out to the credit union recently to resolve his debts. (Tr. 83) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($765) is a debt to a health club in the geographic location where \nApplicant served in the Navy. Applicant said he notified the gym that he was quitting \nmembership when he moved. The account shows no activity after he left the area in \nJanuary 2014. Applicant disputed the account and it no longer appears on his credit \nreport. (Tr. 49-51, 72-75; GE 2 at 9; GE 4; GE 5 at 8) \n \n \nApplicant later engaged a debt resolution firm to help him clean up his credit. He \npaid them $99 a month for 14 months. He now has other credit cards that he is using \nmore responsibly to improve his credit rating. He has received informal advice from \nfamily members on how to improve his credit but has not pursued formal credit \ncounseling. (Tr. 62-64, 83)  \n \nApplicant also acknowledged that for a three-year period, he did not file his tax \nreturns. He later filed all those returns. He also acknowledged that at the time of the \nhearing (December 2018) his 2017 tax returns remained unfiled.3 (Tr. 64-68, 89-90) \n \nApplicant makes $19.36 an hour. He works full time, He earned about $40,000 in \n2018. He pays $1,600 in rent and is current. He lives with a cohabitant, his girlfriend. He \nhas no other debts but for those in the SOR. He also has a part-time, evening job as a \nsecurity guard, earning $80 a night two or three nights a week. He said he was unable \n                                                          \n3 Applicant\u2019s tax issues are not alleged in the SOR, so I have not considered them as disqualifying \nconduct. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nto address his debts because his employment was not particularly stable. He also \nwanted to focus on more recent expenses once he started his new life in a new location. \n(Tr. 49-54, 68) \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged his mistakes. He accepted blame for accruing his older \ndebts, and for not addressing them responsibly. He noted that he has not accrued any \nnewer debt, and that he works hard and stays out of trouble. (Tr. 92-93) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court noted in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d4 \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \n                                                          \n4 Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \nThe financial considerations guideline sets forth several conditions that could \nraise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable: AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); and 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies to mitigate SOR \u00b6 1.g, the debt to the health club. While \nApplicant admitted the debt, he disputed its validity, and it no longer appears on his \ncredit report. His other debts, all to the credit union, remain outstanding and unresolved.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts were all incurred during his brief time in the Navy, which ended \nin early 2012, now several years ago. Although the debts are old, Applicant has also \nnever taken any serious steps to resolve them in the time since then. He has been \ncontent to \u201cstart new,\u201d as he put it, by focusing on his more recent accounts. The fact \nremains, however, that his delinquent debts to the credit union are ongoing and \nunresolved. They are a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct,\u201d5 even though they are dated. As \nsuch, they continue to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.  \n \n \nApplicant had not filed his 2017 tax returns as of the date of the hearing, and he \nacknowledged filing several years of earlier returns late as well. While not alleged as \ndisqualifying conduct, Applicant\u2019s irresponsible handling of his duties as a taxpayer \nserves as another example of the security concerns already evident due to his ongoing \ndebts.

He financed the purchase of a \ncar and two motorcycles while he was a junior sailor in the Navy, and took out several \nother loans as well. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application because he had some \nemployment instability in recent years, and that circumstance impacted his ability to \naddress his debts. Nevertheless, he has yet to address his debts in a responsible way, \nso AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. Similarly, Applicant simply has not established \nenough of a track record of financial responsibility or of good-faith efforts to repay his \ndebts for AG \u00b6 20(d) to apply.

I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant needs to establish a track record of \nfinancial stability and of good-faith steady payments towards his debts before he can \nestablish that he is a suitable candidate for access to classified information.

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n09/12/2019 \nDecision \nMARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on March 23, 2015. On \nJanuary 24, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nE. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 14, 2019, and requested a decision on \nthe record without a hearing. On May 31, 2019, the Government sent Applicant a \ncomplete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM) including documents \nidentified as Items 1 through 6. He was given an opportunity to submit a documentary \nresponse setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on June 11, 2019, and timely submitted \ntwo responses, dated July 12, 2019 (FORM Response 1) and July 17, 2019 (FORM \n\n \n2 \n \nResponse 2), to which the Government did not object. Item 1 contains the pleadings in \nthe case. Items 2 through 6 are admitted into evidence. I admitted the attachments to \nApplicant\u2019s SOR answer and FORM responses as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F. \nThe case was assigned to me on August 7, 2019. \n \nProcedural Matter \n \nItem 4 is a counterintelligence screening questionnaire that was not authenticated \nas required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I conclude that Applicant waived any \nobjection to Item 4. In a section entitled \u201cNOTICE TO APPLICANT,\u201d the Government \nnotified Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of Item 4 on the ground that it \nwas not authenticated. In that section, Applicant was also notified that if he did not raise \nany objection to Item 4 in his response to the FORM, he could be considered to have \nwaived any such objection, and that Item 4 could be considered as evidence in his case. \nNeither of Applicant\u2019s responses to the FORM raised any objection to Item 4.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nUnless otherwise indicated by citation to another part of the record, I have \nextracted these findings of fact from Applicant\u2019s SOR answer (Item 1) and his SCA (Item \n2).  \n \nApplicant, age 50, is unmarried without children. He immigrated to the United \nStates in 1999 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2010. He completed an air \nconditioning technical training program in Iraq in 1991. He attended a U.S. college from \n2001 through 2004, but did not earn a degree. (Item 3 at 5) \n \nThe record does not establish when or if Applicant was previously granted a \nsecurity clearance, or for how long he has worked for his current security clearance \nsponsor. Applicant\u2019s background was investigated twice: by DOD in 2015; and by another \ngovernment agency in 2008. However, the results of those investigations were not \nspecified in the record. (Item 2; Item 4) \n \nThe record does not specify Applicant\u2019s employment history after he completed his \n2015 SCA. When he completed his SCA, he was sponsored by a defense contractor for \na linguist position. However, he never worked for the defense contractor because the \nemployment contract that he signed \u201chad too many errors on the form.\u201d After completing \nhis SCA, he was fired from a security guard job by another employer for failing to perform \nhis assigned duties. He refused to perform janitorial services that he believed were not \npart of his job description. (Item 3 at 6 and 15) \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant was involuntarily terminated three times between \n2009 and 2015, and his subsequent lack of candor about those terminations in his SCA \nand during two security clearance interviews. In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted each \ntermination, but denied any deliberate intent to omit, conceal, or falsify information during \nthe security clearance investigations process. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant was terminated by Employer A in 2009, by Employer B in 2014, and by \nEmployer C in 2015. Neither Employer A nor Employer B specified the reason for the \ntermination in the record. However, Employer A did verify that Applicant was involuntarily \nterminated. Employer C\u2019s reason was that, during his probationary period, Applicant \ninstigated a heated verbal argument and refused to cooperate with his supervisor\u2019s \ninquiries about the incident. (Item 3 at 7, 12-15; Item 5; Item 6) \n \nWhen reporting facts concerning his employment with Employers A through C in \nhis SCA, Applicant provided benign reasons for leaving: \u201clooking for work in a different \nfield\u201d (Employer A) and \u201clooking for better paying job\u201d (Employers B and C). He answered \n\u201cNo\u201d to specific questions about whether he had been: fired, quit after being told he would \nbe fired, or left by mutual agreement following either charges or allegations of misconduct \nor notice of unsatisfactory performance. He also answered \u201cNo\u201d to specific questions \nabout whether he had received a written warning, been officially reprimanded, \nsuspended, or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace. \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a DOD authorized investigator twice in connection \nwith his security clearance application: in July 2015 (Interview 1); and in February 2016 \n(Interview 2). During Interview 1, he initially denied any employment problems. He \nreiterated that he left his job with Employer A to look for work in a different field. He was \nemployed by Employer A as a linguist supporting troops in Iraq. Eventually he disclosed \nthat a confrontation he had with a military member led to his separation from Employer A. \nHe did not report the termination on his SCA because he believed that he had been \u201cmore \nor less laid off.\u201d He denied any wrongdoing in the confrontation and asserted that the \nconfrontation was not the real reason that Employer A could not \u201ckeep him,\u201d but rather \nthe result of a reduction of troops in Iraq. (Item 3 at 7) \n \nAfter the discussion about Employer A, Applicant was asked on multiple occasions \nduring Interview 1 if he had any other employment problems to include personality \nconflicts, which he denied each time. He reiterated that he left his job with Employer B to \nlook for a better paying job. He also explained that his job with Employer C was only a \ntemporary assignment that lasted approximately two to three weeks. (Item 3 at 7) \n \nInterview 2 was conducted to discuss Applicant\u2019s previously unadmitted \nemployment problems. During Interview 2, when asked why he left his job with Employer \nA, Applicant acknowledged that he had been fired by Employer A for refusing to accept a \nshift change. He denied ever being reprimanded by Employer A for several incidents with \nwhich the investigator confronted him. There was no discussion reported about the \nconfrontation he described during Interview 1. (Item 3 at 12, 14-15) \n \nApplicant was employed as a full-time armed security officer by Employers B and \nC. During Interview 2, when asked why he left his jobs with Employers B and C, he initially \nreiterated that he left to look for a better paying jobs and maintained that he had never \nhad any problems to include receiving verbal or written reprimands or being terminated. \nAfter the investigator confronted him with specific facts, he admitted that he was fired by \nEmployer B after being accused of abandoning his post without authorization, and by \nEmployer C after being accused of having a verbal altercation with another employee. In \n\n \n4 \n \nboth instances, he denied any wrongdoing and claimed that the employers had \nmisconstrued events. During Interview 2, he repeated the same rationale for not reporting \nthe three terminations on his SCA: that he did not feel he was required to disclose what \nhe believed were minor issues. (Item 3 at 12-15) \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted the facts as alleged in the SOR about his \nterminations by Employers A through C. However, he denied that he had \u201cin [his] mind\u201d a \nprevious planned intention to \u201cdeliberately\u201d fail to disclose or falsify that information on his \nSCA or during his security clearance interviews. He asserted that the terminations were \n\u201cvery private in nature\u201d and that he was \u201cuncertain\u201d whether he was required to reveal \n\u201cvery private matters.\u201d  \n \nIn support of his claim that he is trustworthy, loyal, and reliable, Applicant attached \nto his SOR answer four recommendation letters, dated between April 2008 and March \n2009, from members of the U.S. Army battalions that he served as a linguist while in Iraq. \nThe \nundersigned \nuniformly \npraised \nhis \nexceptional \nwork \nperformance \nand \ntrustworthiness. Applicant risked his personal safety to assist coalition forces combat and \ndefeat enemy insurgents within the region. (AE A through D) \n \nApplicant asserted favorable facts concerning his character and financial stability \nin FORM Response 1. He also included a reference from the facility security officer of his \ncurrent sponsor. She stated that Applicant \u201chas a long history\u201d with the company and has \nbeen a \u201cvaluable asset.\u201d Applicant\u2019s father, who received numerous accolades for his own \nservice as a linguist, provided a favorable character reference in FORM Response 2. He \ndescribed Applicant as a \u201ctrustworthy, reliable, dependable, [and] loyal son.\u201d (AE E and \nF) \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n\n \n5 \n \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nAppellant\u2019s three involuntary terminations, his failure to report them on his SCA, \nand his lack of candor about them during two security clearance interviews establish the \ngeneral concerns involving questionable judgment and unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations, and the following specific disqualifying conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \nAG \u00b6 16(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative. \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, the Government has the burden of \nproving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative \njudge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an Appellant\u2019s state of \nmind at the time of the omission. An applicant\u2019s level of education and experience are \nrelevant to determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security \nclearance application was deliberate.   \n \nI did not find credible Applicant\u2019s explanations and excuses for his lack of candor \nabout his three involuntary terminations. Regardless of whether he agreed with the \nunderlying rationales or motives, at the time he completed his SCA and during the \ninterviews, Applicant knew that he had been terminated by Employers A through C and \nchose not to report them. Accordingly, I find substantial evidence of an intent on the part \nof Applicant to omit and conceal that information at multiple stages of the security \nclearance investigations process. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(a) is established. \n \nNeither of the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are established: \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nAn applicant's completion of a security questionnaire is the initial step in requesting \na security clearance and the investigative process is contingent upon the honesty of the \napplicant. Beginning with an applicant\u2019s responses in the application, \n \nThe security clearance investigation is not a forum for an applicant to split \nhairs or parse the truth narrowly. The Federal Government has a compelling \ninterest in protecting and safeguarding classified information. That \ncompelling interest includes the government's legitimate interest in being \nable to make sound decisions (based on complete and accurate \ninformation) about who will be granted access to classified information. An \napplicant who deliberately fails to give full, frank, and candid answers to the \ngovernment in connection with a security clearance investigation or \nadjudication interferes with the integrity of the industrial security program. \nISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002). \n \nApplicant\u2019s termination history, both before and after he completed the SCA, raises \nconcerns about his judgment and willingness to comply with rules. But, the security \nsignificance of the terminations lies predominantly with Applicant\u2019s lack of candor about \nthem during the investigations process. The belated admission about his termination by \nEmployer A during Interview 1 was troublesome. However, even more egregious, was \nthe fact that he only acknowledged the terminations by Employers B and C after much \nprodding over the course of two separate interviews. I have serious doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n\n \n8 \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered his favorable character \nreferences and the risks to personal safety that he endured while commendably serving \nU.S. troops in Iraq. However, after weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nunder Guideline E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his deliberate \nlack of candor during the security clearance investigations process. Accordingly, \nApplicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \nGina L. Marine \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted.   \n  \nStatement of the Case \n  \nOn January 22, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence. Applicant responded to the SOR on February 1, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 16, 2019. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled on May 15, 2019.   \n  \nEvidence  \n  \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified, presented the testimony of two witnesses, and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were admitted without objection.  \n \n\n  \n2  \n  \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Ukraine. Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained \nin the request. The facts are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated \nverbatim in this decision. Of particular note is the Russian forces\u2019 occupation of the \nCrimean Peninsula, the ongoing armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the \nongoing arbitrary detentions and human rights abuses from both sides related to the \narmed conflict. The Ukrainian government has failed to take adequate steps to prosecute \nor punish officials engaged in human rights violations and abuses.  \n  \nFindings of Fact  \n  \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer since 2015. She graduated from a U.S. high school in 1999; \ncompleted an associate\u2019s degree in 2002; received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2004; and she \ncompleted a master\u2019s degree in 2006 and a master\u2019s in business administration (MBA) in \n2010. She has been married and divorced twice, and has a six-year-old daughter born in \nthe United States.  \n  \nApplicant was born in Ukraine to Ukrainian parents. She entered the United States \nin 1995 with her parents at age 14. Her father worked for the Ukrainian government in the \nUnited States where he held a sensitive leadership position until he retired in 1999. Upon \nthe completion of her father\u2019s tour in the United States, Applicant\u2019s parents returned to \nUkraine. She stayed in the United States living with high school teachers until she became \n18. After that, she supported herself by working two full-time jobs while attending school \nat night. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2007, and renounced her Ukrainian \ncitizenship.  \n \nApplicant stayed in the United States because she believed in the American ideas \nof freedom, liberty, and the many opportunities offered in the United States that enticed \nher. She believed that there would be a better chance of having a future here in the United \nStates than in Ukraine. She loves the American dream and all the things that are here \nthat are just so different to those in Ukraine. She testified:  \n \nI love this country because this is the only country, as far as I know, in the \nworld that you could be without any support and by working you could \nactually achieve something. You could have an independent life and that's \njust not possible, not possible in Ukraine . . . I really hope like the whole \nworld will become one day, you know, part of the United States because it's \njust the freedom of minds, the freedom of speech, the, you know, just being \nnobody and, achieving, like working and, you know, have a life like that. (Tr. \n39-41) \n \nApplicant testified that when her parents left the United States, they did not have \nany money to provide her with any financial support. She believes they thought she would \n\n  \n3  \n  \nhave the Ukrainian government return her home in a week. However, Applicant stayed \nand since then, she has not had a lot of contact with her parents. Initially, she just had \ntelephonic contact, and now she uses computer programs for face-to-face communication \nso she could actually see and talk with her mother. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father and mother are both in their 70s. Her parents and her half-\nbrother are resident-citizens of Ukraine. According to Applicant, her father has not worked \nafter he retired in 1999. He receives a pension from the Ukrainian government, but \notherwise he has no contact with the Ukrainian government or its military services. \nApplicant has contact with her father once a month. Applicant\u2019s mother was a professor \nat a Ukrainian university. She currently works as an English tutor. Her mother is having \nmedical problems. She was treated for cancer during her stay in the United States (1995-\n1998) and recently had a delicate operation in her country. Applicant communicates with \nher mother about four times a week via electronic means. Her mother visited Applicant in \nthe United States four times: when she got married, when her daughter was born, when \nshe divorced, and on another occasion. According to Applicant, her parents are now \naware she works in a national security position.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s half-brother is married with children. He is a systems engineer for a \nprivate company in Ukraine. They have electronic contact once a month. Between 2002 \nand 2012, Applicant provided around $5,000 to $6,000 in financial assistance to her \nparents and brother. After the birth of her daughter and due to other financial obligations, \nshe has not provided any financial support to her family in Ukraine. Applicant has no \nproperty of financial interests in Ukraine. She believes that because she renounced her \ncitizenship, she has no right to inherit from her parents and the inheritance will go to her \nbrother. \n \nApplicant travelled to Ukraine to visit her family in 2003, 2005, and 2007 using her \nUkrainian passport. She received her U.S. passport in 2007-2008 and used it to travel to \nUkraine in 2009, 2010, and 2014. When she travels, she stays with her family in Ukraine \nfor about 20 days. She does not travel frequently because it takes too long to get to her \nparents\u2019 home and she does not want it to interfere with her job. \n \n \nIn 1999, Applicant received an internship from a U.S. agency, and later she was \nhired as a consultant and granted a clearance. She worked for this agency until 2001. \nShe also was granted a clearance by two other U.S. Government agencies in 2007 and \nin 2010. \n \nApplicant presented four references, two testified and two submitted statements. \nIn general, Applicant is considered to be a good American who is trustworthy, a hard-\nworking single mother who is goal oriented, kind to her daughter, and a caring friend. (AE \n1 and 2; Tr. 21-26) A vice-president (VP) at the corporation where Applicant works \nprovided favorable testimony. He has 23 years of military service experience highlighted \nby his work as a senior service executive at a U.S. command, and as chief of a contracting \n\n  \n4  \n  \noffice for a military service. He met Applicant in 2014 when he interviewed her for her \ncurrent position and they have become friends. He closely supervised Applicant from \nearly 2015 until November 2018, when he was promoted to his current position.  \n \nThe VP believes Applicant is a trustworthy person. She is open, upfront, and \nhonest in her dealings with other people. In his opinion, Applicant is very loyal to the \ncountry that she has adopted and calls her home now. He has no reservations about her \nmaintaining her clearances. (Tr. 30-37) \n \nPolicies  \n  \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017.  \n  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.  \n  \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision.  \n  \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d   \n  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.   \n  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n\n  \n5  \n  \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n  \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n  \nAnalysis  \n  \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence  \n  \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6:  \n  \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:    \n  \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology.  \n \n\n  \n6  \n  \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country \nis associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \nThere is a significant threat of terror and ongoing human rights problems in Ukraine \ncompounded by Russia\u2019s invasion and military occupation of sections of Ukraine, and \ntheir ongoing armed conflict. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of \ninterest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, \nand coercion.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents and her half-brother are citizens and residents of Ukraine. \nThere is potential for state or terrorist violence against U.S. interests and citizens in \nUkraine, and the country has human rights problems. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create \na potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, and coercion. The above disqualifying conditions have been \nraised by the evidence.   \n  \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:   \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \nand \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest.  \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to the Ukraine as well as each \nindividual family tie. Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \nThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified \ninformation from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have \naccess to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests \ninimical to those of the United States. \n\n  \n7  \n  \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we \nknow friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in \nthe economic, scientific, and technical fields.  \n \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. I considered that Applicant\u2019s father held a sensitive \nposition in the Ukrainian government. However, that was close to 20 years ago. He retired \nwhen he left the United States, and did not maintain any connections with the Ukrainian \ngovernment or military forces. \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen. At age 17, she left her parents and stayed in the \nUnited States when they returned to Ukraine. She followed the American dream of \nfreedom and achieving success through hard work and dedication. She has accomplished \nher dream. She is a well-educated woman who is successful in her job and as an \nAmerican. She has a child born in the United States and has immersed herself in the \nculture of the United States. She accomplished her dream on her own, without any \nsupport from her parents or family in Ukraine. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s ties to Ukraine are outweighed by her deep and long-standing \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States. I find that it is unlikely Applicant will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of the United States and \nthe interests of Ukraine. Moreover, even if that was the case, Applicant\u2019s actions since \n1999 demonstrate that there would be no conflict of interest because she can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are \napplicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept  \n  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):   \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n  \n8  \n  \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis.   \n  \nAt age 17, Applicant decided to stay in the United States when her parents returned \nto Ukraine. She educated herself and has become a productive U.S. citizen. She is now \n37, has a six-year-old daughter, and has established deep and long-standing \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns.   \n \nFormal Findings  \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:  \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \n  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c:  \n  \n  \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________  \nJUAN J. RIVERA  \nAdministrative Judge  \n",

Two specifications alleged that in April 2005 and September 2005, he \nstole United States currency, military property, of a value of more than $500, the \nproperty of the U.S. Air Force.  \n \nSix specifications of violations of UCMJ Article 132, submission of a false claim. \nSpecifically, the allegations stated that for the purposes of obtaining the approval, \nallowance, and payment of a claim against the United States, in different amounts \nfor each specification, on six different occasions, Applicant made and used a \nwriting, which Applicant knew said writing was false and fraudulent.  \n \n \nApplicant was sentenced to confinement for 45 days, forfeiture of $1,000 per \nmonth for 12 months, a fine of $7,350, and a reprimand. He was released from \nconfinement after 37 days due to good behavior. Applicant held the rank of major (O-4) \nat the time of his General Court-Martial. He retired as a captain (O-3).5 \n \n \nThe facts surrounding the charges are that Applicant formed a corporation in which \nhe was the only employee. The corporation purchased a recreational vehicle. During his \nreserve duty, the corporation rented to Applicant the recreational vehicle for lodging. \nApplicant rented a space to park the recreational vehicle on the military base where he \nwas serving. The space cost $15 a day. Applicant submitted claims to the U.S. \nGovernment for approximately 177 nights of lodging from 2005 to 2006. He claimed he \nwas staying at the XX Apartment Complex. The amount claimed was for the cost of \nlodging at XX Apartment Complex. The corporation provided Applicant invoices reflecting \nApplicant had paid for lodging at XX Apartment Complex and the amount Applicant had \npaid. This was false in that XX Apartment Complex did not exist, and Applicant had not \npaid a lodging expense for the amount he claimed for reimbursement by the Air Force. \nApplicant submitted these claims for payment. Applicant\u2019s criminal conviction is recorded \nin the FBI database.6  \n \n                                                          \n5 Items 1, 2, 5, 6, 7; AE A.  \n \n6 Items 1, 2, 5, 6, 7.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR and response to the FORM, he disputed the \nGovernment prosecution\u2019s interpretation of the Joint Federal Travel Regulations and \nother aspects of his General Court-Martial.7  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s October 2015 e-QIP, he disclosed that he failed to timely file his \n2012, 2013, and 2014 federal and state income tax returns. Regarding his 2012 returns, \nhe stated: \u201cUnable to compile and complete documentation due to pending divorce.\u201d8 For \n2013, he stated: \u201cUnable to compile and complete documentation due to recent divorce.\u201d9 \nFor 2014, he stated: Unable to compile and complete documentation due to incomplete \ntax filings.\u201d10 He provided the same information for any action he had taken regarding his \nfailing to file his returns, stating: \u201cWithholding at single and zero status should have \ncovered all taxes due. Attempting to complete filings in the next two months.\u201d11  \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in January 2016. He \nadmitted to the investigator that he failed to file his state and federal income tax returns \nbecause he was unable to organize documents and paperwork for his taxes. This \nimpacted all of his taxes for the following years because he could not file any tax returns \nuntil he filed his 2012 tax returns. He told the investigator he intended to file for a six-\nmonth extension on his 2015 tax returns and would resolve his tax issues by the end of \n2016.12  \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant said that he filed his 2012 federal and state \ntax returns in May 2016. He provided an unsigned federal income tax form and a copy of \na May 2016 check to the United States Treasury in the amount of $1,993. Applicant also \nprovided signed copies of his 2013, 2014, and 2015 federal and state income tax returns. \nThey are all dated March 2018. Based on the forms Applicant provided, it shows he was \ndue refunds for those tax years.13 There was no copy of an extension request to the IRS.  \n \nApplicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e, a mortgage that was in foreclosure status \nand was delinquent. In his SOR answer, he indicated he was able to resolve this mortgage \n                                                          \n7 Item 1; AE A, B, C, D, and F are documents and arguments by Applicant regarding his dispute with the \nfinding and verdict of the General Court-Martial. Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR is in the form of a brief \nsigned by his attorney and submitted on behalf of Applicant. Throughout the decision, comments are \nattributed to Applicant that were provided as part of his answer to the SOR in the brief. \n \n8 Item 2. \n \n9 Item 2. \n \n10 Item 2. \n \n11 Item 2.  \n \n12 Item 4. \n \n13 Item 2.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nby paying it off. Documents were provided that show the mortgage was paid in 2015.14 It \nis resolved.   \n \nApplicant admitted the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, a second mortgage on rental \nproperty he owns. Credit reports from November 2015 and February 2017 show the loan \nis past due. A credit report from April 2018 indicates the debt has been charged off. \nApplicant stated in his answer that in his last conversation with the creditor he was told \nthat foreclosure actions would be held in abeyance pending Applicant\u2019s sale of the \nproperty, refinancing it, or bringing the debt current. He planned to pay the debt and \nrefinance it after he received his tax refund.15 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he stated:  \n \nThe foreclosure actions by the second mortgage holder were also \nterminated, and the account is in an agreed status that payment-in-full will \nbe rendered upon any future sale of the property. I acknowledge the debt, \nand I am working to settle it as soon as possible. I have received no \ncorrespondence that indicates the agreed upon status has changed. I \ncontinue to list the mortgage holder on the current home insurance policy \nshould any damage or destruction occur to the property.16  \n \n \nApplicant provided a copy of a voluntarily dismissal of a foreclosure complaint from \nthe creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d that was granted in July 2013. Applicant did not provide \ndocumentary evidence to corroborate the \u201cagreed status\u201d or efforts he has taken to pay \nthe delinquent debt, refinance the loan, or sell the property. The debt is now reported as \ncharged off in the most current credit report.17 Although the creditor is not pursuing \nforeclosure, evidence was not provided to show the debt is resolved or being resolved.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his last divorce, stating his wife \naccumulated excessive debt, and she failed to act responsibly in addressing it. Applicant \ndid not recognize there was a problem until his wife stopped working. He also had tenants \nthat stopped paying, and he was unable to pay the mortgage on his rental property. He \nstated when he was separated from his wife, she would not help him file joint tax returns. \nHis divorce was finalized in November 2013. He then focused on work and lost sight of \nmany things. He stated he would start to work on filing his tax returns, but something \n                                                          \n14 Item 1; AE A. \n \n15 Item 1.  \n \n16 AE A. \n \n17 Item 1; AE A. SOR \u00b6 1.d alleged the account was placed in collection in the approximate amount of \n$6,752. Items 9 and 10 show the debt past due for the same amount. Item 11, the most recent credit report \nshows the charged off amount is $62,735. The last payment made was in February 2012. In Applicant\u2019s e-\nQIP (Item 2) he disclosed the debt was delinquent and listed the amount of the financial issue as $62,735, \nand not as $6,752.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nwould come up that needed his immediate attention. He decreased his expenses and \nwithdrew money from his pension plan. He increased his withholdings for his taxes, so he \nwould not owe tax when he did file. He saw this as an interest-free loan to the government. \nHe viewed his late filing as a \u201cministerial action,\u201d but he concedes, a required one, but it \ndid not deprive the government of revenue.18 \n \n \nApplicant provided copies of performance evaluations from his employers, awards, \ncollege transcripts, resume, and a personal financial statement, among other documents. \nI considered them all, along with his statements and explanations.19  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \n                                                          \n18 Item 1. \n \n19 Item 1; AE A through F. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee \ntheft, fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing deceptive loan \nstatements and other intentional financial breaches of trust; and \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(g) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nIn 2007, Applicant was found guilty at a General Court-Martial of UCMJ for \nviolations involving larceny and frauds against the United States. He failed to timely file \nhis 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 federal and state income tax returns. He has a delinquent \ndebt since 2012 that is not resolved. The above disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \nAlthough Applicant was convicted of charges for larceny, false official statements, \nand fraud against the Government at his court-martial, he continues to dispute its results. \nHe disclosed on his e-QIP that he had difficulty filing his 2012 tax returns because his \ndivorce was pending. It was finalized November 2013, yet he failed to timely file 2013 and \n2014 tax returns, stating on the e-QIP that he would complete the process by the end of \n2016. Applicant filed his 2012 tax returns in 2016. Despite being on notice that tax issues \nare a concern of the Government through the completion of his e-QIP in October 2015, \nhe failed to timely file his 2015 tax returns. After he received the SOR in February 2018, \nhe filed his 2013, 2014, and 2015 delinquent state and federal tax returns. His \nrationalization that he had additional withholding from his income does not mitigate his \nfailure to responsibly comply with the law for those years. His attitude that he was \n\n \n9 \n \n \nproviding the government with an interest-free loan and not depriving it of revenue, further \ndemonstrates his failure to comply with rules and regulations, and minimizes his legal \nduty to do so.  \n \n \nThe pattern of Applicant\u2019s behavior prevents me from finding future behavior is \nunlikely to recur. His conduct casts doubt on his current reliability, good judgment, and \ntrustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to a divorce and his wife\u2019s failure to \nresponsibly handle their finances. These were circumstances beyond his control. For the \nfull application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly. I do not find merit \nto his defense that he was unable to file his tax returns in 2012, 2013, and 2014 due to \nhis divorce that was finalized in November 2013. There is no evidence he filed for \nextensions or filed as married filing single. He did not file his 2012 tax returns until 2016 \nand the remaining years were not filed until March 2018, after receiving the SOR. I find \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application. I find AG \u00b6 20(g) applies because the returns are \nnow filed. However, those late filings are insufficient to fully mitigate the financial concerns \nraised by Applicant\u2019s conduct.  \n \nApplicant resolved the mortgage foreclosure alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. AG \u00b6 20(d) \napplies to this debt. Applicant says he has an agreement with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d \nto resolve the debt in the future. There is no evidence documenting the agreement. Credit \nreports show the debt was in collection for years and is now charged off. Applicant has \nnot made a payment on the debt since 2012. Applicant provided a personal financial \nstatement. It appears he is solvent, but this debt remains unresolved. There is no \nevidence he received financial counseling. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \n     I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old educated man. In 2007, he was found guilty at a General \nCourt-Martial and has a conviction for false official statements, larceny, and fraud. He \ndoes not appear to grasp the gravity or illegality of his previous conduct. He retired from \nthe Air Force as a captain. After leaving military service, he repeatedly failed to timely file \nhis federal and state tax returns. He eventually filed his returns for 2013, 2014, and 2015 \nlate, after receiving the SOR in 2018. The DOHA Appeal Board has held that:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 20 \n \nApplicant has not met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n20 ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June 29, 2016). \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Applicant is 32 years old and a college graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering received in June 2013. Prior to attending college, he served four years on active duty in the U.S. Navy as an aviation electrician\u2019s mate, and made two deployments on an aircraft carrier. He was discharged honorably in January 2010 as a third class petty officer. He used the GI Bill and student loans to attend college from September 2011 until June 2013 when he received his degree. He has been employed as an electrical engineer for a defense contractor since June 2013. He has worked in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for the contractor since January 2014. Applicant married in May 2018. He has a stepson, and a daughter born in December 2018. Applicant has had a security clearance since 2005 when he entered active duty in the U.S. Navy.

Xenakis, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \nBased on a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted. Applicant presented sufficient information to mitigate \nfinancial considerations and foreign influence security concerns. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 21, 2015, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to retain a security clearance required for a position \nwith a defense contractor. The Department of Defense (DOD) could not make the \naffirmative findings required to continue a security clearance. DOD issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR), dated January 17, 2018, detailing security concerns for \nfinancial considerations under Guideline F. The SOR action was taken under Executive \nOrder (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n03/20/2019\n\n  2 \n \nApplicant answered the allegations on February 9, 2018, admitting the six \nallegations (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.f) of delinquent student loans and two consumer delinquent \ndebt allegations (SOR 1.g and 1.h), but provided receipts to verify that the debts had \nbeen paid. He denied the three delinquent consumer debt allegations at SOR 1.i to 1.k. \nIn his denial, Applicant noted that he could not determine the identity and address of the \ncreditors so he was unable to pay the debts. His SOR response included nine exhibits \nincluding performance evaluations; achievement awards; his college diploma; \nmemorandums of support from his supervisor and employer; correspondence to the \nstudent loan service provider; receipts for payment of the debts at SOR 1.e and 1.f; a \npersonal financial statement; W-2 tax forms for 2017; and a certificate of completion for \na financial recovery course.  \n \nThe Government was ready to proceed on June 21, 2018, and the case was \nassigned to me on September 10, 2018. DOD issued a notice of hearing on September \n12, 2018, for a hearing on November 7, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nNovember 7, 2018.  \n \nAt the start of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to add \na Guideline B, Foreign Influence allegation because Applicant had married and his wife \nwas a citizen and resident of the Philippines. (Hearing Exhibit I). Department Counsel \nprovided supporting documents for the allegation. (Hearing Exhibits II to V) Since \nneither Applicant nor his counsel had received adequate notice of the amendment \nunder DOD Directive 5220.6. I postponed the hearing until Applicant\u2019s counsel could \nresearch the allegation, provide an answer, and prepare a defense. (Transcript (Tr.) \nNovember 7, 2018 hearing) \n \nI reconvened the hearing on February 27, 2019. At that hearing, Department \nCounsel presented a motion to amend the SOR to add and reword two allegations \nunder Guideline B; that Applicant\u2019s wife and stepson are citizens of the Philippines \n(SOR 2.a), and that Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of the \nPhilippines (SOR 2.b). Applicant answered the Guideline B allegations at the hearing \nand admitted both allegations but argued that the facts of the allegations did not raise a \nsecurity concern.  \n \nAt the hearing, the Government\u2019s six exhibits (GE 1-6) were admitted into the \nrecord without objection. Applicant testified, and introduced 13 exhibits (AE A through \nAE M) that were admitted into the record without objection. I received the transcript of \nthe second hearing (Tr.) on March 13, 2019.  \n \nProcedural Issues \n \nDepartment Counsel and Applicant requested that I take administrative notice of \ncertain facts concerning the Philippines, and both provided relevant documents. (GE 6; \nAE B and AE C) I will take administrative notice of facts concerning the Philippines as \nnoted in my Findings of Fact.  \nFindings of Fact \n\n  3 \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the record, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 32 years old and a college graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical \nengineering received in June 2013. Prior to attending college, he served four years on \nactive duty in the U.S. Navy as an aviation electrician\u2019s mate, and made two \ndeployments on an aircraft carrier. He was discharged honorably in January 2010 as a \nthird class petty officer. He used the GI Bill and student loans to attend college from \nSeptember 2011 until June 2013 when he received his degree. He has been employed \nas an electrical engineer for a defense contractor since June 2013. He has worked in \nthe United Arab Emirates (UAE) for the contractor since January 2014.  \n \nApplicant married in May 2018. He has a stepson, and a daughter born in \nDecember 2018. Applicant has had a security clearance since 2005 when he entered \nactive duty in the U.S. Navy. (Tr. 26-28; GE 1, e-QIP, dated September 21, 2015; Case \nFile, Response to SOR, Exhibit C, Diploma)   \n \nApplicant received a housing subsidy when he was first arrived in the UAE in \nJanuary 2014, so his monthly salary was approximately $18,000. (Case File, Response \nto the SOR, Exhibit H, Personal financial Statement, Exhibit I; Pay Statement, Exhibit I) \nHis company now provides housing so his monthly salary has been reduced but he has \nno housing cost. His monthly salary is now approximately $10,600, with monthly \nrecurring expenses of $5,800, leaving a net monthly remainder of approximately $4,000. \n(Tr. 61-64; AE G, Personal Financial Statement, dated February 16, 2019) He has a \nretirement account with his employer with a balance of approximately $19,000. (AE E, \nAccount Status, dated, February 16, 2019) He pays into the U.S. Social Security \nSystem and will receive benefits when appropriate. Applicant has no investments other \nthan his U.S. investments; he has only votes in U.S. elections; and he has no \ncitizenship affiliation except to the U.S. (Tr. 59-67; AE M, Social Security Statement, \ndated November 27, 2018) \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations show that he is highly regarded by his \nemployer. The reports show that he displays good technical knowledge, is willing to \nlearn, and is eager, enthusiastic, and responsive. His supervisors stated that he \ndisplays the company\u2019s core values, and has good team building behavior. He was \nrated as honest, with ethical decision making. The reports show that he met his \ncommitments and strives for excellence. Applicant was rated as exceeds requirements. \nHe also received achievement rewards. (Case File, Response to SOR, Exhibits A and \nB) His supervisors and a friend who has worked with Applicant provided \nrecommendations that he be granted eligibility for access to classified information. \n(Case File, Response to SOR, Exhibit D; AE L) \n \nThe SOR lists, and credit reports (GE 2, dated September 21, 2015; GE 4, dated \nJune 21, 2018; GE 5, dated November 6, 2018) confirm the following delinquent debts \nfor Applicant: six delinquent student loan debts for $7,630 (SOR 1.a), $7,191 (SOR 1.b), \n$4,496 (SOR 1.c), $5,938 (SOR 1.d), $5,838 (SOR 1.e), and $1.684 (SOR 1.f); a \ntelephone service account in collection for $771 (SOR 1.g); a utility debt in collection for \n\n  4 \n \n$180 (SOR 1.h); an unknown collection account for $108 (SOR 1.i); a medical account \nin collection for $95 (SOR 1.j); and an unknown collection account for $94 (SOR 1.k). \nThe amount of the student loan debt is approximately $32,000, and the amount of the \nother five debts is approximately $1,248 for a total debt of approximately $33,000.  \n \nApplicant received six student loan disbursements from 2011 until 2013 totaling \napproximately $32,000 to subsidize his GI Bill benefits so he could attend school for his \nbachelor\u2019s degree. (SOR 1.a to SOR 1.f) Immediately after receiving his bachelor\u2019s \ndegree, Applicant started working for his present defense contractor employer and \ntraveled for the company on an orientation tour. He knew that there was a lag time from \ngraduation until he received notice to commence paying back the loans. In January \n2014, he was assigned to and started living in the UAE. Prior to his move to the UAE, \nApplicant had not received any correspondence from a student loan service provider \ninforming him of the procedures for paying the student loans. In the UAE, he did not \nhave good access to the United States postal system and did not receive notice of the \nrequirement to start repayment of his student loans. By the middle of 2014, Applicant \ndetermined that it was time for him to make payments on the student loans. He started \nmaking phone calls to determine what student loan service provider had his loans. The \nonly information had had was the account number. On his September 2015 e-QIP, \nApplicant noted that he had student loan delinquencies because he was in the process \nof determining what loan service provider he needed to contact. After September 2015, \nApplicant continued to occasionally try to determine his student loan service provider. \nHis attempts were infrequent since he was constrained by the demands of his work and \nthe difficulty of communicating from the UAE. (Tr. 67-71) \n \nIn January 2018, Applicant received notice from his employer that his wages \nwould be garnished to start repayment of his student loans. He e-mailed his company \nfor information on the garnishment, and learned the contact information for the student \nloan processing company. He immediately called the student loan processor, and \nlearned the procedure to rehabilitating his student loans. He filed a request with the \nprocessor to have his loan rehabilitated. (Tr. 31-32, 71-72; Case File, Response to \nSOR, Exhibit E, dated January 15, 2018)  \n \nApplicant made ten payments by automatic bank deduction of approximately \n$1,550 each to rehabilitate his student loans, and the student loans were rehabilitated \nby October 2018. Since the student loans have been rehabilitated, Applicant makes \n$221 monthly payments on the student loans by automatic deduction from his bank \naccount. (AE F and H, Repayment Planner, dated November 2018) His student loans \nare now current with a balance of approximately $18,000. (Tr. 32-34; AE A, Letter, \ndated October 29, 2018; AE D, Account Status, dated February 16, 2019)  \n \nApplicant learned of the telephone service debt and the utility debt when he \nreceived the SOR in January 2018. Applicant believed the telephone debt was for his \nfather\u2019s telephone service and not for his phone service. The utility debt was when he \nattending school and lived with a roommate. He believed the utility bill was paid when \nhe and his roommate moved out of their apartment. Applicant believed it was easier and \n\n  5 \n \nsimpler to pay the debts rather than attempt to get information from his father and \nformer roommate who were in the United States. Applicant paid both debts the day he \nreceived the SOR and the debts are resolved. (Tr. 40-42, 72-74; Case File, Response \nto SOR, Exhibits F and G)  \n \nApplicant has no information on the debts listed at SOR 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k. He has \nno knowledge of the debts. He always had health insurance so he does not know why \nhe would have a medical debt. He did not receive any bills that would pertain to these \ndebts since he moved around and has been in the UAE with poor mail service since \n2013. There were no phone numbers or other identifiable information in the credit \nreports he reviewed or provided by the government. He is willing to pay the debts as \nsoon as he learns the identity and contact information of the creditors. The sum total of \nthe three debts is approximately $300 and he has the funds to immediately pay the \ndebts. (Tr. 40-43, 74-75) \n \nApplicant has completed a financial management course (Case File, Response \nto SOR, Exhibit J). Applicant also took a self-study financial recovery program. (Tr. 34-\n35) Applicant and his wife have established procedures for paying their bills when they \nare received. All of their recurring bills are paid from their bank account by automatic \ndeduction. Applicant ensures that his bank account has sufficient funds to pay any \ndebts or bills when received. With this system, Applicant does not believe he will have \nany delinquent debts in the future. Since he married, it is important for him to have good \ncredit and good credit scores. He wants to be financially \u201csquared away\u201d like he was on \nactive duty in the Navy. (Tr. 44-46) \n \nApplicant met his wife in the UAE in March 2016. She is 26 years old and a \ncitizen of the Philippines. She came to the UAE and worked in human resources for a \nnon-U.S. company. They dated for a while and married in May 2018. Applicant reported \nhis marriage to his security officer in early June 2018, and complied with all reporting \nrequirements. His wife was born and raised in the mountainous areas of northern \nPhilippines and completed all of her schooling in the Philippines. There are no terrorist \nactivities in the area where her family is located. Terrorist activities are in the southern \narea of the Philippines.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife had a son before coming to the UAE who was cared for in the \nPhilippines by her mother. Applicant and his wife traveled to the Philippines in \nSeptember 2018 to bring her son to live with them in the UAE. They now have a \ndaughter who was born in December 2018, and is a United States citizen. His wife does \nnot work outside of the home. She stays home to care for their two young children. His \nwife and stepson are citizens of the Philippines but reside in the UAE. His wife wants to \nand is working on becoming a United States citizen. It is a desire of most people from \nthe Philippines to become United States citizens. Applicant wants to raise his family in \nthe United States, and provide his children with the benefits of education in the United \nStates. (Tr. 46-48, 81-82; AE I, J, K, Birth Certificate and Residency Documents) \n \n\n  6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife does not ask him nor do they discuss his work. She only knows \nthat he is an electrical engineer for a U.S. contractor supporting the UAE military.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of the Philippines. \nApplicant\u2019s hardly has a relationship with his wife\u2019s family in the Philippines. His wife\u2019s \nmother is a homemaker and her father a civil engineer. They can speak some English \nbut they mostly converse in the native language of their region of the Philippines. They \nare not fluent in English since it is their third or fourth language. Applicant only met his \nwife\u2019s family once when they spent six days in the Philippines in September 2018 to \nmeet her son and bring him to live with them in the UAE. Applicant only spent six hours \nwith them. His wife occasionally talks to her parents by phone but he does not talk to \nthem because of the language difficulties. His wife has no property or funds in the \nPhilippines and is not in a position to inherit any property. Applicant stated he has little if \nany loyalty to his in-laws in the Philippines because he has had only limited contact with \nthem. He has loyalty to his extended family who are citizens and residents of the United \nStates and that he has known all of his life. (Tr. 82-87) \n \nThe Philippines is a multiparty, constitutional republic with a bicameral \nlegislature. In 2016, the country conducted nationwide elections for the presidency, both \nhouses of the legislature, provincial governors, and local government officials. An \ninternational group of observers determined that the elections were generally free and \nfair but vote buying was widespread. The dynastic political families continued to \nmonopolize elective office.  \n \nThe United States recognized the Philippines as an independent state in 1946 \nand established diplomatic relationships. The U.S. has since designated the Philippines \nas a Major Non-NATO ally. The U.S. and the Philippines maintain a close relationship \nand they have a bilateral security alliance bound by the Mutual Defense treaty of 1951. \nThe U.S. relationship with the Philippines is based on strong historical and culture links \nand a shared commitment to democracy and human rights. The countries have \ncommon strategic and economic interests. \n \nPresident Obama visited the Philippines in 2014 and reaffirmed the United \nStates\u2019 commitment to the security alliance. He noted that the two nations have strong \npeople-to-people ties; a commitment to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region; \nand a commitment to build prosperity for their people and the global economy.  \n \nEven though the U.S. closed its military bases in the Philippines in 1992, the two \nnations have maintained security cooperation. The Manila Agreement of 2011, \nmaintains the 1951 Mutual Defense as the foundation for a robust, balanced, and \nresponsive security partnership. In 2012, the Philippines played a key role in the U.S. \nefforts to rebalance its foreign policy priorities for Asia. In 2014, the two countries \nconfirmed a defense cooperation agreement that will continue to promote peace and \nstability, and underpins Asia\u2019s remarkable economic growth. The agreement allows for \nthe increased presence of U.S. military forces in the Philippines, as well as cooperative \njoint military exercises.  \n\n  7 \n \n \nIn the past decade, the Philippines has been the largest recipient of U.S. foreign \nmilitary assistance in south east Asia. The U.S. and the Philippines have a strong trade \nand investment relationship. The U.S. is the Philippines\u2019 third\u2013largest trade partner. The \ntwo countries made enormous strides to deepen the economic linkage between them.  \n \nThe Philippines and the U.S. share extensive people-to-people ties. Over \n350,000 American\u2019s reside in the Philippines and over 600,000 U.S. citizens visit the \nPhilippines each year. Over forty million people of Philippine descent reside in the \nUnited States. The Philippines have the oldest continuous operating Fulbright Education \nProgram established in 1948, and has hosted a large U.S. Peace Corps program for \nover 50 years. \n \nThere are human rights issues in the Philippines, to include killings by security \nforces, vigilantes, insurgents; torture and abuse of prisoners and detainees by security \nforces; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions, warrantless arrests; public \ncorruption and abuse of power; threats of violence against human rights activists, \nviolence against women; and forced labor. Extrajudicial killings have been a major \nhuman rights concern for many years. Conflicts continue between the government and \nMuslim separatists, communist insurgents, and terrorist groups. Most of the conflict \ntakes place in the south islands of the Philippines far from where Applicant\u2019s in-laws \nlive. The U.S. Department of State advises all U.S. citizens to exercise increased \ncaution in the southern islands and regions due to crime, terrorism, and civil unrest. \n(Hearing Exhibit II; AE B and C) \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n\n  8 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about a person\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. (AG \u00b6 18) The \nfinancial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might \nknowingly compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s responsibility, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Security \nclearance adjudications are based on an evaluation of an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or careless in his or her obligations to protect classified information. \nBehaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how \na person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his or her creditors is a private matter until evidence \nis uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to meet financial obligations. \nAbsent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a \nhistory of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk inconsistent \nwith the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is required to manage his or her \nfinances in such a way as to meet financial obligations.  \n \nCredit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions reveal that Applicant has delinquent \nstudent loans and consumer debts. The evidence in the credit reports and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are sufficient to raise the following security concerns under Financial \nConsiderations Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n\n  9 \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nSince the Government has established adverse financial issues, the Applicant \nhas the responsibility to refute or mitigate the financial issues. \n \n \nI considered the following Financial Consideration Mitigating Conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counselling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual has initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nMitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (a) and (b) do not apply. Applicant\u2019s debts are \nnumerous and not all of the debts have been resolved so they are current. The student \nloans were incurred voluntarily and willingly by Applicant to finance his college degree. \nApplicant did not provide any information to suggest that his other debts were not \nincurred in the normal course of activities and by condition beyond his control. It is \nnoted that Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances by addressing and \nresolving most of his debts.  \n \nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 20 (c) applies. Applicant took two different financial \nplanning and management courses. It is clear that his financial problems are being \nresolved or are under control.  \n \nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 20 (d) applies. Applicant acted in good faith towards his \ndebts. Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty and obligation. Applicant is not required to be debt-free. \nAll that is required is that Applicant act responsibly given his circumstances. Applicant \nmust establish that he has a reasonable plan to resolve financial problems, and that he \nhas taken significant action to implement that plan. Applicant\u2019s plan must show a \nsystematic method of handling debts, and Applicant must establish a meaningful track \n\n  10 \n \nrecord of debt payment. A meaningful track record of debt payment can be established \nby evidence of actual debt payments or reduction of debt through payment of debts. His \nplan does not require paying off all debts immediately or simultaneously. A promise to \npay delinquent debts is not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely \nmanner and acting in a financially responsible manner.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wages were garnished to commence paying his student loans. In \nspite of the garnishment, Applicant presented sufficient information to establish that he \nstarted to address his student loans before the garnishment and before he received the \nSOR listing delinquent student loans. When he believed that he should have received \ninformation how to repay his student loans, he contacted the student loan program to \ndetermine the student loan service provider managing his loans. He learned that the six \nloans he received were consolidated into one service provider so that he was able to \nmake a plan to have the loans rehabilitated and considered in good standing. Applicant \nwas able to make ten large monthly payments on the loans as requested by the loan \nservice provided and the loans are now in a normal payment plan. He continues to \nmake regular monthly payments and has reduced his student loan debt by almost half.  \n \nApplicant also presented sufficient information that he previously paid in full and \nresolved two of his SOR debts (SOR 1.g and 1.h). He was unable to identify and locate \nthe creditors for the remaining three SOR debts. The information in the credit reports \nwas not sufficient to identify the creditors. The three debts are small and Applicant has \nsufficient funds to pay the debts when the creditors are identified.  \n \nApplicant acted responsibly under the circumstances, and he provided adequate \ninformation on his plans to pay and resolve his delinquent debts. Applicant is current \nwith payment arrangements he entered to pay the student loans at SOR 1.a to 1. f. \nApplicant provided significant documents to establish he paid the debts at SOR 1.g and \n1.h. Applicant provided sufficient information that he plans to and has sufficient funds to \npay the three debts at SOR 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k when the creditors are identified.   \n \nApplicant has shown sufficient action to resolve his delinquent debts. Applicant \nprovided enough details and sufficient documentation to show proof of payments, \ncorrespondence to or from the creditors to establish maintenance of contact, evidence \nof attempts to negotiate payment plans, or other evidence of progress or resolution. \nThere is sufficient evidence to establish why Applicant was able to make great progress \naddressing or resolving all of his debts. There is sufficient assurance that his financial \nproblems are being resolved, are under control, and will not recur in the future. He has \nshown a good-faith effort to resolve these debts. His reasonable and responsible \nactions towards his finances is a strong indication that he will protect and safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. Under all these circumstances, Applicant mitigated \nfinancial security concerns.  \n \nForeign Influence \n \n\n  11 \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, financial, \nand property interests, are a national security concern if they result in divided \nallegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they create circumstances in \nwhich the individual may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or \ninterests is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or is associate \nwith a risk of terrorism. (AG \u00b6 6)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife and his stepson are citizens of the Philippines but reside with \nApplicant in the UAE. Since his wife and stepson no longer reside in the Philippines, \nthere is no heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, \nor coercion, and therefore no foreign influence security concern.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of the Philippines. \nApplicant\u2019s contact with his in-laws is minimal. He only met them once for a few hours \non a visit he made to the Philippines to get his stepson. Applicant has little if any \ncommunication with his in-laws because of language issues. As to the in-laws, I \nconsidered the following Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 7 (a) (contact, \nregardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion).  \n \nThe mere existence of foreign relationships and contacts is not sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions. The nature of Applicant\u2019s contacts and relationships \nmust be examined to determine whether it creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \u201cHeightened\u201d is a relative \nterm denoting increased risk compared to some normally existing risk that can be \ninherent anytime there are foreign contacts and relationships. The totality of an \napplicant\u2019s ties to a foreign country as well as to each individual family tie must be \nconsidered. The foreign influence security concern is not limited to countries hostile to \nthe United States. The United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not \nauthorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States. Even friendly nations can \nhave profound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as \nimportant to their vital interests or national security. Friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the U. S., especially in economic, scientific, and technical fields. The \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human \nrights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant is at risk of \ncoercion, persuasion, or duress. \n \n\n  12 \n \nApplicant has just a little more than six hours of face-to-face contact with his \nwife\u2019s parents. Applicant does not communicate with them because of language \ndifficulties. The in-laws reside in a part of the Philippines that only has normal and not \nexcessive or abundant terrorist or criminal activities. These factors do not place a \nheightened risk of exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion on \nApplicant. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 7(a) does not apply. \n \nI also considered disqualifying condition AG \u00b67 (b) (connections to a foreign \nperson, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information or \ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology). The disqualifying condition does not apply. \nThere is no information to establish that Applicant\u2019s in-laws, wife, or Applicant have any \nconnection to a foreign group, person, or government in the Philippines that they have a \nneed, requirement, or desire to help. \n \nEven though there is not a heightened risk, I also considered Foreign Influence \nMitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.  \n \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for or \nobligation to immediate family members. Applicant\u2019s contact with his wife\u2019s parents is so \ncasual and infrequent that they have only met face-to-face for six hours. Applicant does \nnot communicate with them because of language difficulties. These facts do not \nestablish a close and continuing relationship between Applicant and his wife\u2019s parents in \nthe Philippines. His level of contact is at best only casual and infrequent, and does not \nestablish that Applicant\u2019s sense of loyalty to his wife\u2019s family members is significant.  \n \n\n  13 \n \nApplicant\u2019s ties and sense of loyalty to the United States are extensive. He is a \nnative-born United States citizen, raised and educated in the United States. He served \nin the United States Navy for over four years, and now works for a U.S. defense \ncontractor supporting programs sponsored by the United States. Applicant has been \neligible for access to classified information for over 13 years with no blemishes on his \nsecurity record. His immediately family members are all United States residents and \ncitizens. All of his finances are in the United States.  \n \n \nIf Applicant\u2019s in-laws in the Philippines caused him to be placed him in a position \nto have to choose between the interests of the in-laws and the interests of the United \nStates, his connection to and loyalty for the United States is so deep and longstanding \nthat he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of U. S. interests. \nAccordingly, based on all of the factors in this case, Applicant has met his heavy burden \nto show that his relationships with his wife\u2019s in-laws in the Philippines is not a security \nconcern. I conclude Appellant has mitigated security concerns for foreign influence. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access to \nclassified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The whole-person concept requires \nconsideration of all available information about Applicant to reach a determination \nconcerning Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. I considered that \nApplicant served on active duty in the United States Navy for four years, and has \nworked and is working as a civilian employee of a defense contractor for over four \nyears. He has been eligible for access to classified information over 13 years with no \nreported security issues.  \n \n\n  14 \n \nUnder the facts of this case, the Philippine citizenship of Applicant\u2019s wife and \nstepson, and his wife\u2019s immediate family members being citizens and residents of the \nPhilippines does not creates a heightened risk of foreign influence leading to the \npotential for vulnerability, pressure, or coercion on Applicant. Applicant has shown his \noverwhelming connections and ties to the United States by his years of service to the \nU.S. military. Applicant\u2019s years of service increase the probability that Applicant will \nrecognize, resist, and report any attempts by a foreign power, terrorist group, or \ninsurgent group to coerce or exploit his wife and her family\u2019s citizenship in the \nPhilippines. The many years of honorable service weighs heavily towards approval of \nhis security clearance. In addition, Applicant\u2019s entire immediate family members are \ncitizens and residents of the United States, and Applicant has extensive loyalty to the \nUnited States. . \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. For all \nthese reasons, the facts of this case leave me without questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for access to classified information. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me without questions and doubts concerning Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. He has established his suitability for access to \nclassified information. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from his financial situation and foreign influence. Access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \n\n  15 \n \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 51-year-old high school graduate who has worked as a field technician for a defense contractor since December 2016. He and his spouse married in February 2016, and they have a six-year-old son. Applicant\u2019s spouse has an 18-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. Applicant seeks a security clearance for his current duties. He held a DOD security clearance some 30 years ago. (GE 1.) 3 In August 2003, the youngest of Applicant\u2019s three sisters passed away at age 37. Applicant and his parents became guardians of her four children, who were all under age 18.1 Applicant\u2019s parents took the children into their home. Applicant moved into his parents\u2019 home to help care for his three nephews and a niece and provide some financial assistance. He was allowed by a court order to claim the children as dependents on his income tax returns. Applicant obtained health insurance coverage for his nephews and niece, and he went from paying $58 a month to more than $300 a month for health insurance. His food expenditures more than doubled to $400 to $600 a month. Applicant also helped with other household bills, but his father paid the mortgage on the house. (Tr. 23-26, 53-54.) The record evidence contains no information about Applicant\u2019s income at that time. There is also no evidence about any financial assistance provided by the children\u2019s father.

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant had not filed his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2009 \nthrough 2014 as of November 2018. Tax debts and some collection debts have not been \npaid. Several circumstances outside of his control impacted his finances and diverted his \nattention, but his failure to comply with his legal tax obligations for six consecutive years \ncasts doubt on his judgment and reliability. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 18, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD \nCAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n02/04/2019\n\n2 \n \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on February 21, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn September 7, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. On October 5, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for November 15, \n2018. \n \nAt the hearing, five Government exhibits (GEs 1-5) were admitted in evidence. \nThree documents were marked as hearing exhibits (HE) for the record but were not \nadmitted for evidentiary purposes: a March 19, 2018 letter forwarding the proposed GEs to \nApplicant (HE I); a November 5, 2018 email message to Applicant forwarding GE 4 (HE II); \nand a list of the GEs (HE III). Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received \non November 29, 2018. \n \nI held the record open to January 2, 2019, for post-hearing submissions from \nApplicant. He timely submitted copies of his Federal and state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2015 through 2017. The documents were admitted as Applicant exhibits (AEs A-G) \nwithout any objections. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to file his Federal (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a) and state (SOR \u00b6 1.b) income tax returns for tax years 2009 through 2016; that \nApplicant owes delinquent state income taxes totaling $7,810 for tax years 2012 through \n2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and that he owes collection debt totaling $11,631 on seven accounts \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.j). Applicant admitted the allegations, but he also indicated that he had paid \n$2,000 on the account in collection for $7,755 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). He attributed his tax filing and \ndebt issues to several unfortunate events. After his sister died in 2003, he and his parents \nbecame guardians of his sister\u2019s four children and then his parents passed away. He stated \nthat he was working on his tax returns. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old high school graduate who has worked as a field technician \nfor a defense contractor since December 2016. He and his spouse married in February \n2016, and they have a six-year-old son. Applicant\u2019s spouse has an 18-year-old daughter \nfrom a previous relationship. Applicant seeks a security clearance for his current duties. He \nheld a DOD security clearance some 30 years ago. (GE 1.) \n \n\n3 \n \nIn August 2003, the youngest of Applicant\u2019s three sisters passed away at age 37. \nApplicant and his parents became guardians of her four children, who were all under age \n18.1 Applicant\u2019s parents took the children into their home. Applicant moved into his parents\u2019 \nhome to help care for his three nephews and a niece and provide some financial \nassistance. He was allowed by a court order to claim the children as dependents on his \nincome tax returns. Applicant obtained health insurance coverage for his nephews and \nniece, and he went from paying $58 a month to more than $300 a month for health \ninsurance. His food expenditures more than doubled to $400 to $600 a month. Applicant \nalso helped with other household bills, but his father paid the mortgage on the house. (Tr. \n23-26, 53-54.) The record evidence contains no information about Applicant\u2019s income at \nthat time. There is also no evidence about any financial assistance provided by the \nchildren\u2019s father. \n \nIn November 2005, Applicant began working as a systems administrator at $50,000 \na year. (Tr. 37.) In 2006, his father died. Applicant became the primary provider for his ill \nmother, his three nephews, and his niece. In addition to the household bills, Applicant \ncovered some of the cost of his mother\u2019s medications, which, at times, amounted to $800 a \nmonth. (Tr. 24-25.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother died in 2009. Applicant\u2019s youngest nephew was age 17 and his \nniece was age 15 at the time. The younger of Applicant\u2019s sisters claimed the two children \nas dependents on her income tax returns. When Applicant\u2019s parents\u2019 home sold in 2010, \nApplicant\u2019s niece went to live with the older of Applicant\u2019s two living sisters. His nephew \nturned 18, but Applicant continued to claim three exemptions for income tax withholding \npurposes because he needed the extra money. (GE 2; Tr. 26-29, 55-58.) \n \nApplicant did not file his Federal or state X income tax returns when they were due \nfor tax years 2009 through 2014, even for those years when he believed he overpaid his \ntaxes. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 41.) He knew he was supposed to file his income tax returns and he \n\u201cjust didn\u2019t do it.\u201d (Tr. 59.) After Applicant received a notice from state X of tax delinquency \nfor tax years 2009 to 2012,2 he established a repayment plan to address his state his tax \ndelinquencies, and he paid $150 a month until April 2016. He believes he has resolved his \nstate tax liabilities for tax years 2009 through 2011. (GE 2; Tr. 51, 60.) Applicant did not \nadjust his tax withholdings until 2015, when he began to claim zero exemptions. (GE 2, Tr. \n51, 59.) \n \n                                                 \n1 Applicant testified that, in 2006, his niece was age 10 and his nephews were ages 12, 13, and 15. (Tr. 24.) \nHowever, Applicant discrepantly told an OPM investigator (GE 2) and testified at his hearing (Tr. 25, 55) that \nhis two older nephews were 19 and 20 years old and his underage niece and nephew were 15 and 17 years \nold in 2009. \n \n2 Applicant is reported to have indicated during his July 2017 interview with an OPM investigator that he \nreceived the state tax delinquency notice in 2012 for tax years 2009 through 2014 [sic]. (GE 2.) His income tax \nreturns for tax years 2012 through 2014 would not have been due in 2012. It is unclear when he received the \nnotice of tax delinquency. GE 5 shows that he made some tax payments to state X before July 2017 that were \napplied to his tax delinquency for 2012. \n\n4 \n \nApplicant and his spouse planned to marry in 2012, but her mother became ill in \nstate Y. His spouse returned to state Y to care for her mother. With their son born in \nNovember 2012 being raised by his spouse across the country, Applicant began to pay \ncourt-ordered child support. He told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninvestigator in July 2017 that he paid around $500 a month in child support. (GE 2.) At his \nhearing, he recalled that he paid around $800 a month for child support. (GE 2; Tr. 27-28, \n76.) \n \nIn February 2016, Applicant and his spouse married in state Y. Applicant resigned \nfrom his job in state X in March 2016 and moved to state Y in April 2016. He was \nunemployed until July 2016 and supported by his spouse and his savings. He worked as a \ncontact field technician for the next five months at an income of $4,000 a month before he \nobtained a permanent position with his current employer in December 2016. (GE 1; AE D; \nTr. 37.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse handled his income tax returns after their marriage. (Tr. 72.) His \nFederal and state X income tax returns for tax year 2015 were submitted electronically on \nthe tax deadline of April 18, 2016. (Tr. 41.) On adjusted gross income of $64,492, he \noverpaid his Federal income taxes by $1,632 (AE A) but owed $1,216 in income taxes to \nstate X. (AE B.) Applicant testified that his Federal refund was applied to delinquent taxes \nfor previous tax years. (Tr. 41.)  \n \nOn May 1, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). Applicant responded affirmatively to \nan inquiry concerning whether he had failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes \nwhen required in the last seven years. He indicated that he had not yet filed his Federal \nand state income tax returns or paid his taxes owed for tax years 2009 through 2014 and \nthat he owed an estimated $5,000 in back taxes. He explained that there was \u201creally no \nreason not to file,\u201d with respect to tax years 2009 through 2013, but that he had submitted \nhis W-2 forms and would file his delinquent returns for those tax years within 30 days. \nConcerning tax year 2014, he explained that he was working with a tax agency to resolve \nhis back taxes and get his returns filed. He indicated that his sibling \u201cwrote off\u201d his \ndeceased sister\u2019s children on her taxes without his consent, and that as the children\u2019s legal \nguardian, he should have been allowed to claim them as dependents. Applicant related \nwith respect to tax year 2015 that his tax returns had been filed, but he owed $1,500 to \nstate X and was working with the state to resolve his tax debt. Under optional comments, \nApplicant asserted that he \u201cdid start filing and paying taxes again in 2015.\u201d He expressed \nhis belief that his state taxes had been paid up to tax year 2014. (GE 1.) \n \nIn response to an SF 86 inquiry concerning any delinquency involving enforcement, \nApplicant listed a judgment estimated at $7,775 [sic] for a defaulted auto loan (SOR \u00b6 1.e) \non which he could not afford payments after his son was born. He explained that he had \ncontacted the creditor recently to arrange for repayment. Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d to \nwhether he had any bills or debts turned over for collection in the last seven years, and he \nindicated that he owed $315 for a payday loan (SOR \u00b6 1.d), $2,214 for wireless phone \nservices (SOR \u00b6 1.i), and  $149 for cable television service (SOR \u00b6 1.f) that he would \n\n5 \n \nrepay. He explained that he defaulted on the payday loan and his wireless phone account \nbecause he had to pay child support. He questioned his liability for the cable television debt \nclaiming that he did not open the account. However, he also indicated that he would \ncontact the creditor to pay the debt in full. (GE 1.) A check of Applicant\u2019s credit on July 7, \n2017, revealed that he owed $7,755 on the previously disclosed defaulted auto loan (SOR \n\u00b6 1.e); $315 on the payday loan (SOR \u00b6 1.d); $149 for cable television (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and \n$2,214 for wireless phone services (SOR \u00b6 1.i). His cell phone account first became \ndelinquent in December 2015 and was considered seriously past due as of January 2017. \nHis credit report also revealed old collection debts of $668 for natural gas services (SOR \u00b6 \n1.g), $416 for utility services (SOR \u00b6 1.h), and $114 for insurance when he lived in state X \n(SOR \u00b6 1.j). (GE 3.)  \n \nOn July 21, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator for the OPM. He \nadmitted that he had not filed his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2009 \nthrough 2014. His tax returns for tax year 2015 were filed, but he owed approximately \n$1,500 in state X taxes. After he received a notice from state X indicating that he owed \ntaxes for several years starting with tax year 2009, he reported making $150 payments \ntoward his state X income tax debts until he moved in April 2016. Applicant acknowledged \nthat he had yet to resume his tax payments because all of his tax documents had been \nprovided to a local accountant. He indicated that the accountant would file all of his \ndelinquent federal and state income tax returns along with his 2016 income tax returns in \nAugust 2017. Applicant stated that he would establish repayment plans for his tax debts. \n(GE 2.) \n \nRegarding his listed judgment debt for the defaulted car loan, Applicant explained \nthat he made timely payments of $584 a month for about a year until November 2012, \nwhen his son was born and his brother passed away. Applicant helped pay for his brother\u2019s \nfuneral, and he had an ongoing child support obligation for his son until April 2016. \nApplicant had the vehicle voluntarily repossessed, and it was sold at auction in 2013, \nleaving him responsible for a $7,775 [sic] deficiency balance. On receiving notice in \nOctober 2016 of a May 2016 default judgment, Applicant contacted the creditor, who \ndemanded a lump-sum payment that he could not pay. Applicant explained that he and his \nspouse intended to sell her home to repay the debt.3 As for the payday loan, Applicant \nobtained the loan in January 2013 for food, gasoline, and other living expenses. He \nindicated that he contacted the collection entity in January 2017, and indicated that he \nwould pay off the debt in full. However, he later learned that his spouse had not paid the \ndebt. He explained that he and his spouse had budgeted to pay off the debt in October \n2017. Applicant acknowledged the $2,214 wireless telephone debt, which he maintained \nwould be paid in full in August 2017. As for the $149 cable television debt, Applicant \nindicated that he closed the account when he moved in October 2012. He had been \nunaware of a balance due before he obtained his credit report in September 2016. He cited \nlack of funds as the reason why he had not paid the debt, but his child care expenses \nwould be reduced in September 2017 when his son started school. Concerning the \ndelinquencies not listed on his SF 86, Applicant became aware of the $114 insurance debt \n                                                 \n3 As of November 2018, Applicant and her spouse were still residing at the same address, so it does not \nappear that his spouse sold her home to help him pay his debts. \n\n6 \n \nwhen he obtained his credit report. He indicated that he would satisfy the debt by \nDecember 2017. Applicant did not deny the $416 utility debt when confronted, which he \nassumed was a final bill that he did not receive. As for the $668 natural gas debt, Applicant \nwas a tenant when he had a gas leak, and he had heard nothing further about the debt \nafter he contacted his landlord. He indicated that he would work the debt into his budget to \nrepay it by December 2017. Applicant described his financial situation as \u201cgetting better\u201d in \nthat he and his spouse have been able to pay their current living expenses. He added that \nthey would continue to use a budget, live within their means, and start savings for an \nemergency fund. (GE 2.) \n \nOn July 19, 2017, state X billed Applicant for unpaid income taxes totaling $7,810 \nfor tax years 2012 through 2015 after being credited for $783 in payments applied to his \ntax debt for tax year 2012. (GE 5.) On July 28, 2017, Applicant provided the OPM \ninvestigator with a copy of the notice. He explained that the payments he made to state X \nbefore April 2016 fully resolved his state X tax debts for tax years 2009, 2010, and 2011. \nHe expressed an intention to contact state X to establish a payment plan for the taxes \nowed for tax years 2012 through 2015 and to file his delinquent Federal and state income \ntax returns in August 2017. Applicant related that he contacted the gas company about the \n$668 debt and was waiting to hear back about the debt. Applicant had made no effort to \nlook into the $416 utility debt in collection, but he planned to pay it off by December 2017. \n(GE 2.) \n \nApplicant submitted his Federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2016 on \nSeptember 29, 2017.4 (AEs C-E.) Applicant asserts that he filed his income tax returns on \ntime. (Tr. 42.) Based on adjusted gross income of $51,515, Applicant was entitled to \nFederal tax refund of $301. (AE C.) He earned $34,158 of his income in state Y, and was \npaid a refund of $103. (AE D.) Applicant underpaid his state X income taxes by $133 on \nearnings of $17,357 in state X for 2016. He arranged for the debt to be paid through \nautomatic deduction from his bank account. (AE E.) \n  \nApplicant filed his Federal and state tax returns for tax year 2017 before his \nNovember 2018 hearing. (Tr. 43.) After his hearing, he provided copies of his Federal and \nstate income tax returns confirming that they had been filed electronically, but his returns \ndo not show the filing date. Based on adjusted gross income of $95,030, Applicant \noverpaid his Federal income taxes by $1,985 (AE F) and his state Y income taxes by \n$1,623. (AE G.) He received a notice from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that he \nowed approximately $1,300 for tax year 2010 and assumed that his refund for 2017 would \nbe seized and applied to his debt for tax year 2010. However, he received his refund for \n2017. (Tr. 44, 48.) \n \nAs of November 2018, Applicant had not filed his delinquent Federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax years 2009 through 2014. (Tr. 43.) When asked to explain his \ncontinuing noncompliance with his legal obligation to file these tax returns, Applicant \nindicated that he had given his documentation to a local tax preparer, but his spouse \n                                                 \n4 The deadline for filing was April 18, 2017, unless Applicant requested an automatic six-month extension of \nthe deadline to October 16, 2017.  \n\n7 \n \nthought it cost too much and that she could handle them. (Tr. 46.) He was told by state X \nthat if he filed his delinquent state returns, he would receive refunds rather than owe \nincome taxes. (Tr. 45-46.) Applicant now intends to consult a tax attorney for assistance in \nfiling his delinquent tax returns. (Tr. 47.) Applicant has not made any payments toward his \nstate X tax debts since moving to state Y in April 2016. (Tr. 52.) \n \nApplicant focused on resolving his largest consumer credit debt. He testified that he \nmade payments starting in January 2018 to fully satisfy the car loan deficiency in SOR \u00b6 \n1.e. (Tr. 52, 62-64.) As of November 5, 2018, Equifax was reporting the account as having \na zero balance after a $1,127 payment made in October 2018. (GE 4.) Applicant had made \nno progress toward resolving the $315 payday loan (SOR \u00b6 1.d), the $2,214 wireless \nphone debt (SOR \u00b6 1.i), and the $416 utility debt (SOR \u00b6 1.h). (GE 4; Tr. 52, 66-70.) \nApplicant owes $169 on a personal services debt placed for collection in the amount of \n$489 in September 2017. The delinquent cable television debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f) and $114 \ninsurance debt (SOR \u00b6 1.j) were no longer on his credit record (GE 4), but there is no \nevidence that he made any payments toward them. Applicant acknowledges that he has \nnot paid the insurance debt. (Tr. 70.) He was making timely payments of $534 monthly on \nan automobile loan obtained for $22,837 in December 2016. (GE 4.) He had to purchase a \nnew car when his truck broke down. (Tr. 52, 65.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s current salary is $72,300 annually. (Tr. 36.) As of November 2018, he \nhad $230 in combined savings and checking deposits. He has about $3,000 in retirement \nassets. (Tr. 70.) His spouse just started a new, full-time job with the state. She is paid $36 \nan hour. For the past two years, she worked part time, about 20-30 hours a week at $35-\n$36 an hour, while attending school. (Tr. 71, 74-75.) Afterschool care for his son is about \n$300 a month. (Tr. 66.) He and his spouse had previously paid $700 a month for daycare. \n(Tr. 67.)  Applicant believes he is \u201con track to do a lot better [financially].\u201d (Tr. 72.) He \nestimates that after paying his routine bills, he has $500 a month to put toward his debts, \nsuch as his taxes. (Tr. 73.)  \n   \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \n\n8 \n \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \n\n9 \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant acknowledges that he has yet to file his Federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2009 through 2014. With regard to his alleged failure to file timely tax \nreturns for tax years 2015 and 2016, Applicant filed his returns for 2015 on the tax deadline \nin April 2016. He filed his returns for tax year 2016 in late September 2017, which would \nhave been within the extended tax deadline if he applied for an automatic extension. There \nis no evidence showing that he filed for an extension, and his tax returns for 2016 do not \nindicate whether the IRS and states X and Y accepted his returns as timely. However, it \ndoes appear that his income tax returns for tax year 2016 were filed well before the SOR \nwas issued in January 2018. \n \nIn July 2017, state X billed Applicant for $7,810 in income taxes and penalties owed \nfor tax years 2012 through 2015. Applicant now asserts that he has been told by the state \nthat he will be entitled to refunds if he files his delinquent returns, but he presented no \ncorroborating documentation. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or \nfraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual \nFederal, state, or local income tax as required,\u201d applies because of his noncompliance with \nhis tax filing obligations for tax years 2009 through 2014 and the evidence of outstanding \nstate X tax delinquency. \n \nAvailable credit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions establish a record of consumer \ncredit delinquencies that raise Guideline F security concerns under AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to \nsatisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant \nhad a vehicle voluntarily repossessed in 2013 when he could no longer afford the $548 \nmonthly payment. After resale at auction, he owed a $7,755 deficiency balance on his auto \nloan that was ignored until January 2018. Six other accounts totaling $3,876 were placed \nfor collection. \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply. One or \nmore of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n\n10 \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nWhile acknowledging that Applicant\u2019s tax problems and consumer credit \ndelinquencies were largely incurred before he moved to state Y, his ongoing failures to file \nhis Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2009 through 2014 and to address \nhis past-due taxes to state X for tax years 2012 through 2015 constitute continuing conduct \nof security concern not mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(a). Likewise, although his default of his car \nloan is not recent in that he stopped paying on his vehicle loan in 2012, the deficiency \nbalance went unpaid before 2018. His wireless telephone debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i became \nseriously delinquent in January 2017, so it is a relatively recent collection debt. \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances were negatively impacted by the deaths of his sister and his \nparents, which are circumstances contemplated within AG \u00b6 20(b). Following the death of \nhis father in 2006, Applicant had to cover most of the financial obligations for his \nhousehold, which included his three nephews, his niece, and his mother. Applicant had \nfinancial responsibility in 2009 for his youngest nephew and his niece after his mother died. \nHe may not have known beforehand that his sister would claim the children as dependents \nfor income tax purposes, given he had legal guardianship of the children. However, it would \nmitigate only the tax delinquency that resulted from him claiming three exemptions for \nincome withholding in 2009. Applicant had a legal obligation to file timely tax returns \nwhether or not he owed taxes, and it was a matter within his control.  Applicant did not act \nresponsibly under AG \u00b6 20(b) by not filing his income tax returns for six consecutive tax \nyears and by not adjusting his tax withholdings before 2015 to accurately reflect his tax \nstatus after his nephew came of age and his niece moved in with his sister in 2010.  \n \nRegarding his handling of his consumer credit accounts, Applicant incurred some \nunexpected financial costs for his brother\u2019s funeral in 2012. After his son was born in \n\n11 \n \nNovember 2012, Applicant had to pay court-ordered child support, which set him back \nfinancially. Even so, a significant element of financial responsibility is keeping in contact \nwith one\u2019s creditors to attempt to resolve debts. Applicant credibly asserts that he made tax \npayments to state X to fully satisfy his state income tax delinquency for tax years 2009 \nthrough 2011. A July 2017 state tax billing reflects that payments totaling $783 were \napplied to his state X tax liability for tax year 2012. It is likely that his state tax liabilities for \n2009 through 2011 have been paid, given those tax years were not included on the recent \nnotice of tax delinquency and the state applied some payments received to his tax debt for \ntax year 2012. It is also noted that Applicant paid a significant amount to resolve his \ndefaulted vehicle loan. These payments to address his state taxes and his vehicle loan are \nviewed favorably, but some concern persists because of his failure to give adequate priority \nto complying with his tax-filing obligation when he knew it was of concern to the DOD. \n  \nApplicant\u2019s tax payments to state X until April 2016 and his more recent satisfaction \nof his defaulted vehicle loan in 2018 warrant some application of AGs \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and, \nwith respect to his state taxes, also 20(g). Applicant has shown good financial judgment in \nmaking timely payments on a car loan obtained in late December 2016, and by filing with \nhis spouse\u2019s help his income tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2017. These tax filings \nsuggest that Applicant may comply with tax-filing deadlines in the future. Yet, even where \ntax problems have been corrected and an applicant is motivated to prevent such problems \nin the future, the administrative judge is not precluded from considering an applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness in light of longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility. See e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 2015). The Appeal Board has long held that \nthe failure to file tax returns suggests a problem with complying with well-established \ngovernment rules and systems. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04437 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, \n2016.) The Appeal Board recently reiterated that a person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his \nor her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See ISCR Case No. 17-01471 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2018).   \nIt is difficult to understand Applicant\u2019s delay in filing his tax returns, particularly where it may \nbe in his self-interest to do so, given his claim that he will be entitled to a refund of state X \ntaxes and not owe the $7,810 currently being demanded by the state. Applicant testified \nthat he intends to retain a tax attorney for assistance in filing his delinquent returns. His \nintention is not enough to fully mitigate the security concerns that persist because of his \nunresolved tax matters. \n \nConcerning his unresolved collection debts, Applicant\u2019s income of $72,300 annually \nwould appear to be sufficient for him to make some debt payments. He testified that his \nfinancial situation is improving and that he has about $500 a month that could be put \ntoward his debts. However, he had yet to contact some of his creditors, including the IRS \nabout a tax debt for 2010 of approximately $1,300. Promises to pay a debt at some future \ndate are not a substitute for financially responsible behavior. \n  \n\n12 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). Applicant has worked for his \nemployer since December 2016. He candidly disclosed his tax filing and debt issues on his \nMay 2017 SF 86 and indicated at that time that he would file his delinquent tax returns \nwithin 30 days. Those tax returns had not been filed as of his November 2018 hearing, \nwhich casts doubt on his reliability. The Appeal Board has repeatedly held that the \ngovernment need not wait until an applicant mishandles or fails to safeguard classified \ninformation before denying or revoking security clearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) (citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. \nCir. 1969)). It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to give priority to such an important obligation as filing tax returns required by law \ncauses lingering doubt about his security worthiness that has not been fully mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.j: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it not is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Tr. 33) \n \n \nSince 2010, Applicant has given his parents about $500 for medical expenses. The \nlast time was two years ago. He said his brothers help his parents financially. (Tr. 36, 39-\n40, 48)  \n \n \nApplicant said most of the terrorist problems in Nigeria occur in the northern part \nof the country. He said his family lives in the western area, which is between 300 and 500 \nmiles away. He has never been to northern Nigeria. (Tr. 37-40)  \n \n \nApplicant owns a car and has a U.S. checking account and credit card. He does \nnot have any financial interests in Nigeria. He does not have any relatives in the United \nStates. He is active in his church. (Tr. 44-46)    \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s facility security officer (FSO) testified. In addition to being the FSO for \nApplicant\u2019s employer, he also works in the human resources department. The FSO has \nknown Applicant since 2015. He said Applicant is a top database specialist and has \nreceived high performance ratings, which indicate that he exceeds expectations. (Tr. 50-\n53) \n \n \nNigeria \n \n \n Nigeria faces many challenges fueled by sectarian, religious, and ethnic violence. \nNumerous terrorist groups are increasingly active throughout Nigeria. Threats of \nkidnapping and violence are high, and the Department of State warns U.S. citizens that \nall travel to Nigeria should be avoided. Of particular significance are the poor human rights \nrecord; the active and hostile presence of Boko Haram and ISIS; and other insurgent and \nextremist groups that generate instability and openly attack police, security and military \nforces, the local populace, and U.S. citizens and interests. \n  \nPolicies \n \nThis national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying under AG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; 1 and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology.  \n \nNigeria has significant internal anti-western terrorism threats that operate openly \nand contrary to U.S. interests. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s close connections and visits to his \nfamily there generate significantly heightened risks of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a). \n \nApplicant has ongoing contacts with his parents and three brothers, who are \ncitizens and residents of Nigeria. He visited his family in 2013 and twice in 2016. He has \n                                            \n1 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, that factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and \ncould potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. \nBd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nprovided some financial support to his parents. These relationships create a heightened \nrisk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because terrorists and insurgents in \nNigeria seek intelligence and engage in behaviors that are hostile to the United States\u2019 \ninterests. Applicant\u2019s relationship with family members creates a potential conflict of \ninterest between Applicant\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and \nhis desire to help family members living in Nigeria. The evidence is sufficient to raise a \ndisqualification under AG \u00b6 7(b).  \n \n  \nAfter the Government produced sufficient evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nThree mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable to the disqualifying \nsecurity concerns based on these facts: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nConsidered in light of the substantial anti-western insurgent and terrorism threats \nin Nigeria, Applicant did not sufficiently demonstrate that it is unlikely he could be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual or \ngovernment and those of the United States due to his family ties in Nigeria. He has \nlegitimate and appropriately close relationships with family members living in Nigeria, and \na strong interest in protecting those people. His communication and contact with them \nare neither casual nor infrequent. Accordingly, he failed to establish the mitigating \nconditions set out in AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (c). \n \nThe evidence also fails to establish sufficient mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b). A key \nfactor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the United States.\u201d Applicant has minimal connections to the United States: \nhe arrived in the United States in 2008; he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2009; he \nbecame a citizen in September 2014, less than five years ago; and he started working for \na defense contractor in 2015. These connections do not outweigh his history and familial \nrelationships with Nigeria. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant\u2019s U.S. \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nties are so deep and longstanding that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterests involving his family in Nigeria in favor of the U.S. interests. Accordingly, he did \nnot mitigate the foreign influence security concerns under this condition. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B and in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThe foreign influence security concerns do not arise from any questionable \nconduct by Applicant, but rather circumstances that are normal results of his family \nsituation. There is no evidence that he has ever taken any action that could cause \npotential harm to the United States. However, after weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, and all pertinent facts and circumstances in the context of the \nwhole-person, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns pertaining to \nforeign influence. The significant potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress \nremains unmitigated. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:   \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsels \nFor Applicant: Aileen B. Xanakis, Esq.  \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCREAN, THOMAS M., Administrative Judge: \nBased on a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I find that Applicant \nfailed to mitigate drug involvement and substance abuse security concerns. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on March 28, 2016, to retain a security clearance required for her duties with a \ndefense contractor. Applicant reported on this e-QIP that she occasionally used \nmarijuana from June 1979 until June 2013. She also reported experimental use of \nmarijuana in September 2014. Applicant also reported that she was granted eligibility for \naccess to classified information in May 2009.   \nOn April 4, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse (Guideline H). These actions were taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \n02/26/2019\n\n2 \n \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the Department of Defense on June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 26, 2018. She admitted the two allegations \nof drug involvement and substance misuse. She noted that her marijuana use was \nsporadic, and she did not use marijuana between 2009 and 2014. She admitted that \nshe used marijuana one time in 2014 and again one time in September 2017. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on June 1, 2018, and the case was \nassigned to me on September 10, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on September 12, 2018, scheduling a hearing for \nNovember 7, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The Government offered two \nexhibits were marked and admitted into the record as Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and \n2, and were admitted without objection. Applicant testified, and offered four exhibits \nwhich I marked and admitted into the record without objection as Applicant Exhibits (AX) \nA through D. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 16, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are included in my findings of fact. After a thorough \nreview of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following additional findings \nof fact. Applicant is 59 years old. She graduated from high school. She received an \nassociate\u2019s degree in May 1982. She has taken some college courses but has not \nreceived a degree. She has received computer-based certifications. Applicant first \nmarried in December 1978 and divorced in June 1981. She married a second time in \nJune 1981 and divorced in June 1989. She married a third time in September 1990 and \ndivorced in June 2005. She has one child from her third marriage. Applicant has worked \nsupporting various companies and defense contractors as a project manager or \ndirector. Her hobby is to do bead work on dresses. (Tr. 16-22; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated \nMarch 28, 2016; GX 2, Response to Interrogatories and Personal Subject Interview, \ndated March 23, 2018; AE A, Resume, undated; AE B, Transcript, dated August 24, \n2015)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from \nabout 1980 through at least September 2017 (SOR 1.a); and used marijuana after being \ngranted a DOD security clearance in June 2014 (SOR 1.b).  \n \n \nApplicant received her first eligibility for access to classified information while \nsupporting a United States Army command in 2009. Her clearance was renewed in \nJune 2014. (Tr. 27-30) \n \n \nApplicant first used marijuana in 1982 when she was 23 years old. She was \ndating her future second husband who was a marijuana user. He asked her to try the \ndrug and she did. There was occasional use, about once or twice a year, in the \nfollowing eight or nine years she was married to her second husband. After they \ndivorced in 1989, she did not use marijuana again until 2014. She characterized her use \nas infrequent. (Tr. 30-33; 43-44) \n\n3 \n \n \nApplicant did not use marijuana when married to her third husband from 1990 to \n2005. Applicant had a significant other living with her from 2009 until 2014. During this \ntime, she used marijuana once or twice. Her significant other, who was a heavy \nmarijuana user, smoked the drug in her presence. While she used marijuana only \ninfrequently, she believes she inhaled marijuana from the second-hand smoke from her \nsignificant other. (Tr. 33-34, 44, 53-55) \n \n \nIn 2014, Applicant had a friend visiting her who had not previously used \nmarijuana. She suggested to the visiting friend that they use the marijuana left over from \nher significant other. Applicant and her friend smoked the marijuana once using a pipe. \nShe used the drug voluntarily. She told her security office about this use of marijuana a \nfew months later when she had a periodic review for her security clearance. (Tr. 33-37, \n44-45)  \n \n \nOn Labor Day weekend in 2017, Applicant was visiting a friend in a state where \nmarijuana is legal. She attended a party with her friend and tried a piece of candy laced \nwith marijuana. A significant number of people attending the party were using the \ncandy. Applicant\u2019s friend did not force her to use the marijuana candy, and Applicant did \nnot buy the marijuana candy. The individual is still Applicant\u2019s friend, but Applicant now \nstays with her brother and his family when she visits the state. Her brother is not a \nmarijuana user. (Tr. 37-38) \n \n \nApplicant knew the candy had marijuana in it, She knew she had a security \nclearance at the time. From 2009, she knew that the use of marijuana was against \nsecurity rules and regulations. She characterized her use of the marijuana candy as bad \njudgment on her part. She used the marijuana candy because she was in an \nenvironment where the rules were different and marijuana was legal. The people she \nknew at the party were using marijuana because it was legal. She did it as an \nexperiment to gain knowledge of the effects of the marijuana candy. Her security \nclearance was an issue and she knew she had to report her use to her security officer \nwhen she returned. (Tr. 38-40; 45-47. 49-50) \n \n \nApplicant reported her use of the marijuana candy to her security officer on her \nreturn from the trip. She has never taken a drug test with her company. Her company \nwas in the middle of a review of security clearances for their employees. If the company \nhad not been involved in the review process, Applicant would have reported her use of \nmarijuana candy at her next security review. The security personnel would not have \nknown about her use of marijuana if she did not report it herself. (Tr. 40-43, 50-53) \n \nApplicant presented four affidavits of recommendation for granting her eligibility \nfor access to classified information from friends, fellow workers, and her security \nmanager. The writers attest to her dedication, work ethic, knowledge and excellent work \nperformance. They did not believe the allegations reflect Applicant\u2019s character, respect \nfor law and rules, or willingness and ability to protect classified information. They found \nApplicant to be responsible and trustworthy. (AE C)  \n\n4 \n \nApplicant also submitted her statement of intent not to use illegal substances or \nabuse prescription drugs in the future. She agrees to be randomly drug tested. If a drug \ntest is positive, she agrees to immediate and unqualified revocation of her security \nclearance. (AE D)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the Administrative Guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel. . .\u201d The \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to obtaining a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \n\n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, because it may impair judgment and \nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction. Drugs are defined as mood and behavior \naltering substances, including drug material and other chemical compounds identified \nand listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. Marijuana is included in the \nSchedule 1 list. (AG \u00b6 24)  \n \nApplicant used marijuana occasionally from 1980 until May 2014. She was \ngranted eligibility for access to classified information in June 2014. In September 2017, \nshe knowingly consumed a marijuana infused candy. Applicant\u2019s admissions and the \navailable evidence is sufficient to raise the following Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse Disqualifying Conditions under AG \u00b6 25: \n \n(a) any substance misuse; \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \n \n \nI considered the following Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 \n26: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome the \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug\u2013using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n\n6 \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \nWhile there is no \"bright line\" rule for determining when conduct is recent or \nsufficient time has passed since the incidents, a determination whether past conduct \naffects an individual's present reliability and trustworthiness must be based on a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the evidence. Based on an evaluation of the evidence \npresented at the hearing and in the case file, I conclude that the mitigating conditions do \nnot apply.  \n \nApplicant used marijuana occasionally from 1982 until 1989 with her second \nhusband. She did not use marijuana from 1989, when she divorced her second \nhusband, until she used again a few times while living with a significant other from 2009 \nuntil 2014. Her significant other was a heavy marijuana user and she also inhaled \nsecond-hand marijuana smoke. Applicant used marijuana once in May 2014. She was \ngranted access to classified information in June 2014. She used marijuana in the form \nof a candy in 2017.  \n \nThe majority of Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana was infrequent and occasional. \nHowever, her use of marijuana was under circumstances that are likely to recur. While \nthe use was infrequent and occasional, her marijuana use was over an extended period \nof time. She would stop for a while, then use marijuana again. She knowingly and \ncontinually lived with marijuana users for a number of years. She even introduced a \nfriend to marijuana and provided the illegal drug. The circumstances of her use were not \nunusual but voluntary, under normal circumstances, and could recur.  \n \nAfter being granted eligibility for access to classified information, she used \nmarijuana in the form of candy. She knew the candy contained marijuana, she knew she \nhad a clearance, and she knew that security clearance and government workplace rules \nprohibited the use of marijuana. Applicant did not present evidence of enrollment in or \nattendance at a drug treatment program.  \n \nHer last use was only about 18 months ago. Under these circumstances, there \nhas not been an appropriate period of abstinence. Even though Applicant provided a \nstatement that she does not intend to use drugs in the future and her security clearance \ncould be revoked if she did use illegal drugs, she has not established sufficient \ncircumstances that indicate a change in lifestyle and environment. Applicant failed to \nmitigate security concerns for drug involvement.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n7 \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the recommendations \nof Applicant\u2019s friends and coworkers that she is reliable and trustworthy and should be \ngranted eligibility for access to classified information. The allegations under Guideline H, \nas established by the government\u2019s evidence, reflect a lack of good judgment by \nApplicant. The evidence shows a use of marijuana even while having eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Applicant\u2019s statement of intent not to use marijuana in \nthe future has little impact because of her previous history of voluntary use. These facts \nleave me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s judgment and her suitability for \naccess to classified information. For all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant has not \nmitigated drug involvement security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDepartment of Defense on June 8, 2017.  \nOn February 5, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on March 9, \n2018. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on July 20, 2018. A notice \nof hearing was issued on August 24, 2018, scheduling the hearing on October 10, 2018. \nThe case was transferred to me on October 9, 2018.  The hearing was held as \nscheduled. During the hearing, the Government offered eight exhibits which were \nadmitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 8.  Applicant testified. The record was held \nopen to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. She timely submitted a nine-\npage document which was admitted as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. The transcript (Tr.) \nwas received on October 19, 2018. Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.   \n01/02/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a DoD contractor seeking to maintain a \nsecurity clearance. She has worked for her current employer since March 2017. She \nhas a 24-year history of working for various defense contractors. The highest level of \neducation Applicant has achieved is high school. She is married, but recently separated. \nShe has a 16-year-old son with her current husband and a 27-year-old daughter from a \nprevious relationship. (Tr. 21-22; Gov 1)   \n \nOn November 28, 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application as \npart of a periodic reinvestigation. (Gov 1) A subsequent security clearance background \ninvestigation revealed Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in January 2016. The \nbankruptcy was dismissed in November 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 2 at 3,5-6; Gov 3; Gov 4; \nGov 6 at 2; Gov 7 at 3).  The SOR alleged delinquent debts, to include:  a $693 debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 4 at 49); a delinquent state tax debt in the amount of $793 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: \nGov 4 at 49); a delinquent mortgage in the amount of $32,694 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 4 at 25-\n26, 49; Gov 6 at 2; Gov 7 at 4); two debts owed to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in \nthe amounts of $8,339 and $7,184 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f: Gov 4 at 49); and a delinquent \nautomobile loan that was delinquent in the amount of $596. (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 4 at 25-26, \n49; Gov 8 at 6). \n \nApplicant initially encountered financial problems while her daughter was \nattending college from August 2009 to May 2015.  She and her husband were unable to \nget financing for her daughter\u2019s education because they had a bad credit rating. They \nmade arrangements with a private party to pay $2,000 monthly during the six months \nthat her daughter attended college. They made the payments, but got behind on their \nmortgage at least $600 monthly over the five-year-period that her daughter attended \ncollege. The mortgagor contacted Applicant in 2013 and informed her that partial \npayments could not be accepted until Applicant paid all of the arrearage. They \nrecommended a loan modification. The loan modification was approved, but one \npayment was missed after the modification was approved, and the modification was \nwithdrawn.  They applied for a second modification, but were denied.  The mortgage \nwas sold to the current lender. Applicant and her husband submitted a third request for \na modification which was denied. (Tr at 29-32; Gov 8 at 4) \n \nWhen the third request for a mortgage modification was denied, Applicant filed \nfor Chapter 13 bankruptcy on January 6, 2016, in an attempt to save her home. Her \nhusband declined to be a party to the bankruptcy. Applicant and her husband\u2019s net \nmonthly income at the time of the bankruptcy filing was $8,834.39. Their total monthly \nexpenses were $6,812. Approximately $2,022 was left over after expenses each month. \nApplicant agreed to a payment plan of $2,200 monthly payments for months 1-4; $800 \nmonthly for months 5 \u2013 33; and $1,568 monthly for months 34 \u2013 60.  Applicant initially \nmade payments. On November 15, 2017, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court dismissed \nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy for failure to make payments.  (Tr. 25-29; Gov 3; Gov \n4) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant paid towards the Chapter 13 plan for several months. Several events \noccurred that affected her ability to make her payments.  In March 2017, her employer \nlost the contract and it was awarded to another contractor. She accepted a job with the \nnew contractor, but her annual pay was decreased by $12,000. The cost of her health \nbenefits increased and she worked a month without pay while the contracts were \ntransitioning. Her new employer did not provide corporate credit cards or travel \nadvances. When she is on official travel, she is expected to pay for all expenses from \nher personal funds, with the exception of airfare, and then file for reimbursements.  She \nwas advised when she filed for reimbursement, she would be paid within a week. It took \nthe company a month to reimburse her for her travel expenses. (Tr. At 16-17, 24; \nAnswer to SOR) \n  \n \nApplicant testified that her husband was not good with his finances. He would not \ncontribute to the household expenses. He spent his money \u201cwilly nilly.\u201d  They had a joint \naccount where both were expected to deposit money in order to pay for the household \nexpenses. Her husband would often not contribute or would withdraw the funds for his \npersonal use. (Tr. 26, 32, 37, 53-55, 65-66) \n \n \nApplicant enrolled her son in a private high school with an annual tuition of \n$16,000 while she was making payments towards her Chapter 13 plan. She admits that \nshe could not afford the tuition payments and payments towards the Chapter 13 plan. \nShe and her husband did not qualify for financial aid.  The tuition payments were $1,600 \na month. She paid $800 and her husband paid $800.  Applicant enrolled her son in \nprivate school for better opportunities. The school was pursuing her son because of his \nathletic abilities. He does better academically and is doing well. (Tr. 38-41, 63) \n \n \nApplicant also stated that various unexpected expenses such as car repairs, \nhouse repairs, and mold removal after their basement was flooded during Hurricane \nIsabel contributed to their inability to pay expenses. (Tr. 28; Response to SOR)  \n  \nThe status of the remaining SOR debts: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: $693 debt owed to a business/collection agency:  Applicant is not \nsure what this debt is for.  In her response to the SOR, Applicant believed this debt  \nmight be related to her Chapter 13 bankruptcy because she did some research and the \ncreditor is identified as a leading source of bankruptcy account management products \nand services. She believes it is a valid debt and is attempting to locate a good point of \ncontact with the company. During the hearing, Applicant testified that she admits the \ndebt, but does not know what it is for. She thinks it might be for not turning in cable \ntelevision equipment, but she is not sure. She claims that she has not attempted to \nresolve the debt after her bankruptcy was dismissed. She is not sure how she can \nlocate the debt. (Tr. 41-42; Response to SOR)  \n \n SOR \u00b6 1.c: $793 state income tax debt: Applicant testified that her husband \nagreed to pay the state tax debt. After the hearing, she provided a copy of an \ninstallment bill from the state comptroller, dated July 2, 2018. The balance was \n\n \n4 \n \n \n$1,112.80.  Her husband agreed to pay $51.33 on a monthly basis. There is no \ndocumentation that he is making regular payments toward this debt. (Tr. 44-46, 67; AE \nA at 2) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d:  $32,694 delinquent mortgage debt:  Applicant filed for bankruptcy in \nan attempt to save her home from foreclosure. After the bankruptcy was dismissed, her \nhome went to foreclosure in July 2018. She is not sure if they owe anything after the \nforeclosure. She initially prepared a plan for her and her husband to follow, but her \nhusband did not follow the plan. They agreed to let the home go to foreclosure and \nseparated.  They are planning to divorce. (Tr. 46-47; Response to SOR)  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f: $8,339 and $7,184 federal tax debts: Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy paperwork lists two tax debts owed to the IRS for $10,079 and $7,184. It is \nnot clear what tax years the debts were incurred. (Gov 4)  Applicant is not sure how the \ntax debt was incurred. She asserts that she claims no exemptions, but believes her \nhusband claimed more exemptions than he should have claimed. She attempted to \narrange a payment plan with the IRS before filing for bankruptcy, but it was not \nsuccessful. During the hearing, she was not sure how much she owed towards the \nfederal tax debt. She estimated it was about $15,000. She set up a payment plan with \nthe IRS in August 2018.  She pays $300 monthly to the IRS. (Tr. 47-52, 58-59)   \n \nThe record was held open to allow Applicant to provide information about the \ncurrent status of her federal and state tax debts. She provided a statement about \ninstallment agreement activity from July 17, 2017, to July 16, 2018. The statement listed  \na tax debt for the 2013 tax year with beginning balance of $3,916; and a tax debt for the \n2014 tax year with a beginning balance of $1,543. The statement showed an ending \nbalance of 0 even though no payments were made. Applicant did not provide a \ncomplete history of her federal income tax returns so it is not clear whether the tax \ndebts listed for 2013 and 2014 are the same tax debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant did \nnot provide proof of the installment agreement she entered into with the IRS in August \n2018. She testified that she paid $300 a month to the IRS, but provided no \ndocumentation verifying payments. The record evidence is inconclusive regarding the \nstatus of Applicant\u2019s federal tax debts. (AE A)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: $596 delinquent debt owed on a car loan:  Applicant purchased a \nused car. She encountered financial problems and was unable to make payments on \nthe car. The car was expensive to maintain and she spent over $2,000 in repairs. She \nvoluntarily turned the car into the dealer in June 2018. She is not sure whether she \nowes any money as a result of turning in the car. (Tr. 55-56; Response to SOR)  \n \nApplicant earned $97,000 annually before the contract changed to her current \nemployer. Her annual income was reduced to $85,000.  She currently earns around \n$87,000 annually. Her husband\u2019s annual income is approximately $70,000. Applicant \nhas approximately $30,000 in a 401(k) account. She has about $50 in savings. She and \nher husband are separated, but there is no formal separation agreement.  She intends \nto file for divorce at some point in the future. (Tr. 52, 59, 62-27)  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n \nApplicant provided several Certificates of Appreciation noting her outstanding \nperformance on several projects she worked on as a contractor over the past eight \nyears.  This indicates she is a highly valued contractor employee. (AE A at 3-8)  \n \n \nApplicant states that she has worked as a government contractor for over 24 \nyears. She would never put the security of the nation in jeopardy. (Tr. 71) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n  \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n \nGUIDELINE F: Financial Considerations  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, which she tried to resolve by filing \nfor bankruptcy under Chapter 13. The plan was dismissed for failure to make timely \npayments towards the plan. She and her husband owe the IRS approximately $17,264 \nas well as $793 in delinquent state income taxes. The SOR also alleged three \ndelinquent accounts, which included a mortgage, and a car loan, with a total \napproximate balance of $33,983. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f) apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case.  \n  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAn individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or careless in his obligations to protect classified information. Behaving \nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in \nother aspects of life. A person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until \nevidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to pay debts under \nagreed terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  \n \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information.  See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018). \n \nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s federal tax debts, the emphasis of the DOHA Appeal \nBoard on security concerns arising from tax cases is instructive.

July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \n\u201cHis delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action \nonly after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that \nApplicant has rehabilitated himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of \nrules and regulations expected of someone entrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR \nCase No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing grant of a security \nclearance and emphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay taxes); See also \nISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security \nclearance, and stating \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal \nGovernment for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other \nobligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d).  \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005))  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n8 \n \n \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control:  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. \nThe $693 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is unresolved. Although a payment plan is in place, \nthe balance on the state tax debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) has increased from $793 to $1,112. \nWhen she surrendered her car to the dealership, it is likely that Applicant will owe a \ndeficiency balance after the car is sold at auction. (SOR \u00b6 1.g). It is unclear whether \nApplicant will owe anything as a result of her home foreclosure. Finally, the status of \nApplicant\u2019s federal tax debt is uncertain. Although Applicant provided a statement \nindicating that there is a zero balance on the taxes owed for tax years 2013 and 2014, \nshe did not provide an explanation as to how the tax debt was paid even though no \npayments were received.  Applicant did not provide a full transcript from the IRS, so she \nstill might owe taxes for other tax years, such as 2015 or 2016. The only evidence in the \nrecord is the federal tax debts listed on her Chapter 13 bankruptcy paperwork, but no \ntax years were listed. Applicant was not certain of what years the tax debts were \nincurred. I cannot conclude that tax debt has been resolved. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because Applicant\u2019s financial situation was adversely \naffected by her employment transition from one contractor to another.  She experienced \na $9,000 annual income reduction as well.  She recently separated from her husband \nwhom she blames for most of the financial issues. These circumstances were beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control and adversely affected her ability to pay her bills. However, this \nmitigating condition is given less weight because Applicant has not demonstrated she \nacted responsibly under the circumstances while most of the delinquent debt was \nincurred.  While it is admirable that Applicant wants the best for her children, she opted \nto pay for her daughter\u2019s college education over a four-year period rather than paying \nher mortgage, which resulted in a significant mortgage delinquency. In 2016, she filed \n\n \n9 \n \n \nfor bankruptcy under Chapter 13 in an attempt to save her home. During this same \ntimeframe, she enrolled her son in a private school with annual tuition costs of $16,000.   \nWhile Applicant says her husband spent money that should be used for household \nexpenses elsewhere, they also incurred a monthly tuition payment of $1,600, which \nprevented her from making payments towards the Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan which \nultimately led to the dismissal of the bankruptcy. Applicant and her husband appeared \nto have the income to manage their expenses, they made poor decisions when \nmanaging their finances. For this reason AG \u00b6 20(b) is given less weight.      \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. Applicant did not take a formal financial counseling \ncourse. It is not clear that she has a plan in place to avoid future financial issues.  \n \n \nAG & 20(d) does not apply because Applicant has not demonstrated a good-faith \neffort towards resolving her delinquent debts. She filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy, but her \ncase was dismissed for failure to make payments in November 2017.  She has not \ntaken steps to resolve her delinquent debts since that time. While Applicant has \nreduced her expenses by moving into a one bedroom apartment, she has not shown \nthat she is making a good-faith effort to resolve her federal tax debts. \n \nAG & 20(g) does not apply. The record is inconclusive that all of Applicant\u2019s \nfederal and state tax debts are being resolved.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n       I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \nemployment history as a federal contractor. I considered Applicant\u2019s reduction in income \nafter a new contractor won the bid on the project that she works on. I considered that \n\n \n10 \n \n \nApplicant recently separated from her husband and moved into a one-bedroom \napartment. However, Applicant has several debts that have been neglected for years. \nGranted, she wants to provide her children with the best education, but she chose to \npay for their tuition even though she was unable to pay her daily expenses. Her \ndaughter\u2019s college tuition payments resulted in a serious mortgage debt and ultimately a \nhome foreclosure.  She enrolled her son in a private school while she was undergoing a \nChapter 13 bankruptcy plan. The monthly tuition resulted in Applicant defaulting on the \nChapter 13 payment plan. She has not attempted to resolve her debts after the Chapter \n13 was terminated for failure to make payments.  As a security clearance holder, she \nshould have taken a proactive approach towards resolving her state and federal income \ntax debts. She did not follow through with her attempts to enter into payment plans with \nthe IRS. She did not provide sufficient evidence to indicate that her federal tax debts are \nbeing resolved. Security concerns under financial considerations are not mitigated.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.g \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Corrales, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, alcohol consumption, and personal conduct. Eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 28, 2015, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a set of interrogatories. On March 5, 2018, Applicant \nresponded to those interrogatories. On October 5, 2018, the Department of Defense \n(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD \n4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG) for all covered \n03/18/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse), G (Alcohol Consumption), and E (Personal Conduct), and detailed \nreasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on October 15, 2018. In a notarized statement, dated \nNovember 26, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the Government\u2019s \nfile of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by DOHA on January 3, 2019, \nand he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, \nto file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition \nto the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on January 8, 2019. His \nresponse was due on February 7, 2019. Applicant apparently chose not to respond to the \nFORM, for as of March 8, 2019, he had not done so. The case was assigned to me on \nMarch 8, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with limited comments all of the \nfactual allegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse of the SOR \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.i.); and alcohol consumption of the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through \n2.c.), but his comments related to the factual allegations pertaining to personal conduct \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a. through 3.c.) were not responsive, for he failed to specifically \u201cadmit\u201d or \n\u201cdeny\u201d those allegations. Instead, he admitted the general conclusory introduction to \nthose allegations. Accordingly, due to the uncertainty of Applicant\u2019s intentions with \nrespect to the personal conduct allegations, and the Government\u2019s failure to follow up on \nthem, I have registered a denial to the three factual allegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions \nand comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a welder with his current employer since May 2015. A 2010 high school graduate, \nApplicant received college credits over a four-year period, but did not earn a degree. He \nhas never served with the U.S. military. He was granted a security clearance in January \n2016. Applicant has never been married, and he has no children.  \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse, Alcohol Consumption, and Personal \nConduct \n \n \nApplicant was a substance abuser whose substances of choice were marijuana, \nAdderall\u00ae,1 Suboxone,2 and alcohol. A prescription is required for both Adderall\u00ae and \nSuboxone. \n \n \nApplicant started smoking marijuana (3-4 puffs of a marijuana joint) and drinking \nbeer (6-8 Miller Light) on a daily basis after he broke his ankle while skateboarding when \nhe was 14-years old, for they helped him with the pain. After his ankle healed, he \ncontinued his daily use of those two substances, essentially to relax. During an interview \nwith an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in October \n2017, Applicant denied that he had a problem with either substance. He said that he did \nnot plan on stopping his usage as he had already scaled back his use of marijuana to 2-\n3 times per month (actually transitioning from using marijuana joints to vaping with \nmarijuana oil in June 2017), and his beer consumption to one six-pack every 1-2 weeks, \nalthough he acknowledged that he consumes alcohol to the point of intoxication \napproximately three times per year at family and social gatherings. Furthermore, he \nclaimed he shows up to work on time, and it does not affect his various family \nresponsibilities.3  \n \nThe marijuana leaf for the joints that Applicant initially obtained was purchased \nfrom someone who would meet him at Applicant\u2019s home. The cost was not revealed. The \nmarijuana oil that Applicant now uses costs about $40 per vial, and he purchases it at \nvarious outlets and through a cell phone app.4  \n \nApplicant denied that his use of marijuana or alcohol have contributed to any \nfinancial, criminal, employment, or security problems.5 Applicant\u2019s denial is inaccurate, \nand not based on fact.  \n \nApplicant was employed as a welder by one federal contractor from October 2010 \nuntil May 2015, during which time he was still using marijuana on a daily basis with work \ncolleagues in the parking lot, and consuming beer before going to work on various \noccasions. On February 27, 2015, Applicant was administered a random urinalysis and \nbreathalyzer test for alcohol and drugs. He tested positive for marijuana and failed the \n                                                          \n1 Adderall\u00ae is a prescription medication used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) \nand narcolepsy. Adderall, a brand name, is a combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine, which \nare central nervous system stimulants, can be habit-forming. See https://medicineplus.gov/druginfo/ \n \n2 Suboxone is a drug that contains buprenorphine, and it is used to reduce symptoms of opiate \naddiction and withdrawal. See https://medicineplus.gov/druginfo/ \n \n3 Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated October 20, 2017), at 4-6. \n \n4 Item 4, supra note 3, at 5. \n \n5 Item 4, supra note 3, at 5. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nbreathalyzer test for alcohol.6 He was immediately suspended under the collective \nbargaining agreement, and referred to the company\u2019s Employee Assistance Program \n(EAP). While in the EAP, he again tested positive for marijuana and failed a breathalyzer \ntest. As a direct result of his substance abuse under the collective bargaining agreement, \non April 14, 2015, Applicant\u2019s employment was terminated.7 In his e-QIP, Applicant \nreported that he had left voluntarily by mutual agreement after failing his urinalysis and \nbreathalyzer tests.8 \n \nOn May 29, 2016, Applicant exited a parking lot without slowing down or stopping \nat the stop sign. A police traffic stop was made and the officer smelled alcohol coming \nfrom the vehicle. There was an open cold case of beer observed. After questioning \nApplicant and determining that he had consumed \u201ca couple at lunch,\u201d and that there were \nillegal drugs in the vehicle, the officer conducted a search of the vehicle. The officer found \nan open cold can of beer, two glass marijuana smoking devices with marijuana residue, \na plastic container with two grams of marijuana in it, and two prescription bottles without \nthe proper markings containing Adderall\u00ae and Suboxone. Applicant falsely stated to the \nofficer that he had prescriptions for both medications,9 and in his March 5, 2018 response \nto the interrogatories, he acknowledged that in the last three years before the \ninterrogatories, he had never been prescribed any opioid or Adderall\u00ae.10 He was charged \nwith possession of marijuana, 1st offense; possession of paraphenalia \u2013 not syringes; \nprescription violation; and open container.11 On August 12, 2016, the prosecutor moved \nfor \u201cnolle prosequi\u201d on the open container and marijuana charges.12 The result of the \nremaining charges was not reported. \n \nAlthough Applicant initially told the OPM investigator in October 2017 that he did \nnot plan on stopping his usage of marijuana as he had already scaled back such use, in \nhis November 2018 Answer to the SOR, he altered his response to say that he \u201cwill not \nuse marijuana anymore.\u201d13 Applicant admitted that his most recent use of marijuana \noccurred during the first week of October 2017, when he used a marijuana vaping device \n                                                          \n6 Item 6 (Warning Notice, dated February 27, 2015). \n \n7 Item 6 (Notice of Discharge, dated April 14, 2015). \n \n8 Item 3 (e-QIP, dated May 28, 2015), at 12-13. \n \n9 Item 5 (Police Field Case Report, dated May 29, 2016). \n \n10 Item 4 (Response to Interrogatories, dated March 5, 2018), at 2. \n \n11 Item 5 (Police Summary, dated June 1, 2016); Item 4 (Two Uniform Summonses, undated.  \n \n12 Item 7 (Incident History, dated February 14, 2018); Item 4 (Two Uniform Summonses), supra \nnote 10. \n \n13 Item 2 (Answer to the SOR, dated November 26, 2018), at 1. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nwith marijuana oil.14 His claimed last use of alcohol occurred at dinner, the night before \nhis October 2017 interview, when he consumed two beers.15  \n \nAlthough Applicant reported in his e-QIP that he had attended EAP-referred \n\u201ctreatment\u201d with Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) for one month in 2015,16 Applicant told the \nOPM investigator that he has never sought counseling or treatment as a result of his use \nof alcohol or any other substance, and he has never been professionally diagnosed as \nabusing alcohol, being alcohol dependent, abusing drugs, or being drug dependent.17 His \nparticipation in the EAP program was a failure because of his positive urinalysis and his \nfailed breathalyzer test. \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n  \n \nOn May 28, 2015, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he responded to a \nquestion pertaining to the illegal use of drugs or drug activity found in Section 23: if, in the \nlast seven years, he had illegally used any drugs or controlled substances by injecting, \nsnorting, inhaling, swallowing, experimenting with or otherwise consuming any drug or \ncontrolled substance? Applicant responded that he had tried marijuana in high school and \nthen again one night in March 2015, while partying with friends. He added that he was \nnow more responsible and needed to be gainfully employed. Applicant certified that his \nresponse was \u201ctrue, complete, and correct\u201d to the best of his knowledge and belief.18 In \nfact, his answer was deliberately false and incomplete, because he concealed both his \ntrue history of marijuana abuse and his declared future intentions, all as set forth above. \nBased on his response, a security clearance was given to him in January 2016. \n \n \nWhen he was questioned by the OPM investigator in in October 2017, Applicant \ncandidly admitted that he did not disclose his full history of marijuana use because he did \nnot want to lose his job, and he also admitted that he was not candid during an earlier \nOPM interview \u2013 an unalleged act of conduct in the SOR \u2013 because he was scared and \ndid not want to lose his security clearance because he would also lose his job.19  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n                                                          \n14 Item 4, supra note 3, at 4. \n \n15 Item 4, supra note 3, at 5. \n \n16 Item 3, supra note 8, at 27. \n \n17 Item 4, supra note 3, at 5, 7. \n \n18 Item 3, supra note 8, at 25-26. \n \n19 Item 4, supra note 3, at 6. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d20 As Commander in Chief, the President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d21   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d22 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.23  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \n                                                          \n20 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n21 Exec.

Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n23 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d24  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d25 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24:       \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \n                                                          \n24 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n25 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia;  \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \nApplicant admittedly purchased,26 possessed and used marijuana, both before and \nafter he was granted a security clearance; he possessed Adderall\u00ae, and Suboxone \nwithout a prescription; on two separate occasions, he tested positive for marijuana during \nrandom urinalyses conducted by his employer; he was arrested and charged with \npossession of marijuana, 1st offense; possession of paraphernalia \u2013 not syringes; \nprescription violation; and open container. In October 2017, Applicant told an OPM \ninvestigator that he did not plan on stopping his usage of marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b), \n25(c), 25(f), and 25 (g) have been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse:  \n                                                          \n26 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal \nBoard. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to \nevaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider \nwhether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular \nprovision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis \nunder Directive \u00a7 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also \nISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. \nSept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant\u2019s unalleged conduct, \nsuch as his purchase of marijuana, as well as his lack of candor, will be considered only for the five purposes \nlisted above.  \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has been using marijuana \nfrequently over a lengthy period since he was 14-years old; he smoked marijuana at the \nworkplace, with work colleagues; although he was on suspension from one employer for \nusing marijuana, he ignored his responsibilities under the collective bargaining agreement \nand again tested positive during his EAP rehabilitation opportunity; and in October 2017, \nhe stated that he did not plan on stopping his usage of marijuana. It was only after the \nSOR was issued in October 2018 that Applicant changed his stated intentions with \nrespect to using marijuana in the future. While Applicant now claims to have no intention \nto use illegal substances in the future, it should be noted that he did not submit a signed \nstatement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, \nacknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national \nsecurity eligibility.  \n \nWhile Applicant\u2019s purported abstinence from illegal or unauthorized substances is \nto be encouraged, he admitted that his most recent use of marijuana occurred during the \nfirst week of October 2017, when he used a marijuana vaping device with marijuana oil. \nConsidering the lengthy period and frequency of his marijuana use, commencing when \nhe was 14-years old; his repeated opportunities to abstain from such use while employed \nwith the employer who terminated him for violation of the drug use provisions under the \ncollective bargaining agreement; and his evolving position regarding future intentions, \nApplicant\u2019s period of purported abstinence is simply too brief to establish a confidence \nthat a relapse will not soon occur. In addition, there remains one lingering concern \nregarding Applicant\u2019s possession of Adderall\u00ae and Suboxone without a prescription. \nFurther exploration into why he possessed those two medications was never made, \nleaving the issue unresolved. Under the circumstances, Applicant\u2019s actions continue to \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set forth \nin AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed. \n \nApplicant started drinking 6-8 beers on a daily basis when he was 14-years old. In \nOctober 2017, he denied that he had a problem with alcohol, and indicated that his beer \nconsumption had been reduced to one six-pack every 1-2 weeks. Nevertheless, he \nacknowledged that he consumes alcohol to the point of intoxication approximately three \ntimes per year at family and social gatherings. Applicant consumed beer before going to \nwork on various occasions.  \n \nAlcohol has caused Applicant difficulties at work and with the police. In February \n2015, in addition to a random urinalysis for marijuana, he was administered a random \nbreathalyzer test for alcohol. He failed the breathalyzer test. He was suspended under \nthe collective bargaining agreement, and referred to the company\u2019s EAP. While in the \nEAP, he again failed a breathalyzer test. In April 2015, Applicant\u2019s employment was \nterminated. In May 2016, after Applicant was stopped by the police, he was charged, in \npart, with an open container. The charge was eventually dismissed. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(b), \nand 22(c) have been established, and AG \u00b6 22(e) has been partially established because, \nwhile there has been no diagnosis with alcohol use disorder, Applicant failed to follow the \nEAP guidelines by continuing to consume alcohol while in the program. \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \n The guideline also includes several examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 23 that \ncould mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant routinely and frequently \nconsumed alcohol, including before going to work on various occasions; he consumed \nalcohol to the point of intoxication approximately three times per year; he failed \nbreathalyzer tests; he was terminated from employment; and he was arrested. Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior, stemming from his association with alcohol, has not been infrequent, and the \ncircumstances developed do not appear to be unusual. Applicant has never \nacknowledged that there is a pattern of maladaptive alcohol use, and he has failed to \nprovide evidence of actions that he may have taken to overcome the problem. Other than \nhis failed EAP program, he has not participated in a counseling or treatment program. \nApplicant said that he now only consumes one six-pack of beer every 1-2 weeks. He \nclaimed that his last use of alcohol occurred at dinner, the night before his October 2017 \nOPM interview, when he consumed two beers. Applicant has not demonstrated a clear \nand established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence. Accordingly, under the \ncircumstances, there remain doubts on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of some conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personal security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing; \n \n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is \nillegal in that country; \n \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, \nwhile legal there, is illegal in the United States; and \n \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment. \n \nMy discussions related to Applicant\u2019s Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse, \nand Alcohol Consumption are adopted herein. As noted above, Applicant admittedly \npossessed and used marijuana, both before and after he was granted a security \nclearance; he possessed Adderall\u00ae and Suboxone without a prescription; on two \nseparate occasions, he tested positive for marijuana during random urinalyses conducted \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \nby his employer; he was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana, 1st offense; \npossession of paraphernalia \u2013 not syringes; prescription violation; and open container. In \nOctober 2017, Applicant told an OPM investigator that he did not plan on stopping his \nusage of marijuana.  \n \nIn addition, Applicant started drinking 6-8 beers on a daily basis when he was 14-\nyears old. In October 2017, he denied that he had a problem with alcohol, and indicated \nthat his beer consumption had been reduced to one six-pack every 1-2 weeks. \nNevertheless, he acknowledged that he consumes alcohol to the point of intoxication \napproximately three times per year at family and social gatherings. Applicant consumed \nbeer before going to work on various occasions. Alcohol has caused Applicant difficulties \nat work and with the police. In February 2015, in addition to a random urinalysis for \nmarijuana, he was administered a random breathalyzer test for alcohol. He failed the \nbreathalyzer test. He was suspended under the collective bargaining agreement \u2013 in \nviolation of a written commitment made by him to his employer as a condition of \nemployment \u2013 and referred to the company\u2019s EAP. While in the EAP, he again failed both \nhis drug urinalysis and his breathalyzer test. In April 2015, Applicant\u2019s employment was \nterminated. In May 2016, after Applicant was stopped by the police, he was charged, in \npart, with an open container. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), 16(e), and 16(f) have been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes one condition under AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns arising from Personal Conduct:  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) minimally applies. Applicant eventually candidly admitted that he did \nnot disclose his full history of marijuana use because he did not want to lose his job, and \nhe also admitted that he was not candid during an earlier OPM interview because he was \nscared and did not want to lose his security clearance because he would also lose his \njob. To date, other than the failed EAP program, there is no evidence that Applicant has \nobtained counseling or treatment. Under the circumstances, Applicant\u2019s actions continue \nto cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.27  \n  \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 26-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a welder with his current \nemployer since May 2015. A 2010 high school graduate, Applicant received college \ncredits over a four-year period, but did not earn a degree. He was granted a security \nclearance in January 2016.  \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant admittedly purchased, possessed and used marijuana, both before and after \nhe was granted a security clearance; he possessed Adderall\u00ae and Suboxone without a \nprescription; he ignored his responsibilities regarding drugs and alcohol under a collective \nbargaining agreement and was terminated from employment after he tested positive for \nmarijuana during two random urinalyses and breathalyzer tests conducted by his \nemployer; he was arrested and charged with possession drugs, including marijuana, \nAdderall\u00ae and Suboxone; possession of paraphernalia;  and open container. He initially \nlied about the true extent of his substance abuse because he feared losing his job or his \nsecurity clearance, but he told an OPM investigator that he did not plan on stopping his \nusage of marijuana. Applicant did not alter his declared intent until after he received the \nSOR. He consumes alcohol to the point of intoxication approximately three times per year, \nand he consumed beer before going to work on various occasions. \n \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his Drug \nInvolvement and Substance Abuse concerns, Alcohol Consumption concerns, and his \nPersonal Conduct issues. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n                                                          \n27 See U.S. v.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 55-year-old senior electrical engineer, employed by a defense contractor since 1986. He married in 1987 and separated in July 2015. He shares custody of two children, 18 and 14 years old. He currently holds a top secret security clearance. The SOR alleges Applicant is delinquent on seven consumer debts totaling approximately $30,500; failed to file Federal tax returns for 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017; and is delinquent on approximately $13,137 in Federal income taxes for tax years 2015 and 2016. The SOR allegations are supported by substantial evidence. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations except he disputed the amount owed in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and noted that he filed his 2013 and 2014 tax returns, but he had not filed his 2016 and 2017 tax returns as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. Applicant separated from his spouse, moved from the house, and filed for divorce but never completed the process due to attorney costs. He paid about $5,000 in attorney fees in 2015 and 2016. Marital debts were not divided, but a temporary order was filed in 2015 regarding the parties\u2019 rights and obligations with respect to the children. Applicant pays child and spouse support totaling about $2,400 per month, and he pays his spouse\u2019s home utilities and insurance costs. He began to accumulate debts in 2015 and 2016 due to the costs of separation and divorce proceedings. In 2018, Applicant borrowed about $40,000 from his 401k retirement plan. The home occupied by ",

On \nMarch 16, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF.1 Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on August 1, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on August 1, 2018, scheduling the \n1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). The Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) were revised effective June 8, 2017, and apply herein. \n02/06/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nhearing for August 30, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, \nand Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D were admitted without objection. Post hearing, \nsupplemental Applicant exhibits AE E through G were offered in evidence and were \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 10, \n2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old senior electrical engineer, employed by a defense \ncontractor since 1986. He married in 1987 and separated in July 2015. He shares custody \nof two children, 18 and 14 years old. He currently holds a top secret security clearance. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant is delinquent on seven consumer debts totaling \napproximately $30,500; failed to file Federal tax returns for 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017; \nand is delinquent on approximately $13,137 in Federal income taxes for tax years 2015 \nand 2016. The SOR allegations are supported by substantial evidence. In his Answer to \nthe SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations except he disputed the amount owed in SOR \n\u00b6 1.a, and noted that he filed his 2013 and 2014 tax returns, but he had not filed his 2016 \nand 2017 tax returns as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. \n \nApplicant separated from his spouse, moved from the house, and filed for divorce \nbut never completed the process due to attorney costs. He paid about $5,000 in attorney \nfees in 2015 and 2016. Marital debts were not divided, but a temporary order was filed in \n2015 regarding the parties\u2019 rights and obligations with respect to the children. Applicant \npays child and spouse support totaling about $2,400 per month, and he pays his spouse\u2019s \nhome utilities and insurance costs. He began to accumulate debts in 2015 and 2016 due \nto the costs of separation and divorce proceedings. In 2018, Applicant borrowed about \n$40,000 from his 401k retirement plan. The home occupied by his spouse is paid, and he \nis renting a home for himself. Applicant disclosed that he is delinquent on debts not listed \nin the SOR, and is paying on two auto loans, including his spouse\u2019s car. \n \nApplicant testified that he filed his 2014 and 2015 taxes when due, but did not file \nthe 2016 or 2017 returns on time because he did not have sufficient income to pay the \ntaxes owed.2 When he started to file tax returns as a single filer, his tax liability \nsubstantially increased. After the hearing, Applicant submitted a letter from the IRS \naccepting his offer to pay his 2015 and 2016 tax arrearage of $6,053, by December 22, \n2018. However, at the hearing, Applicant was unsure of how he could raise sufficient \nfunds to pay the tax arrearage. He stated that he has about $1,500 net remainder each \nmonth, but \u201csomething always comes up.\u201d He noted he had about $150 in his checking \nand savings accounts. No evidence of final satisfaction of the tax debt was provided. \n \n                                                     \n2 Applicant testified that he has already paid about $36,000 in 2018, to cover taxes owed for 2016 and \n2017. AE C shows IRS transcripts showing payments of $24,681 with Applicant\u2019s 2016 and 2017 tax \nreturns. The 2016 return was filed in May 2018, and the 2017 return was filed on time in April 2018. \n\n \n3 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a 2017 judgment owed to a credit card company for $10,861. \nApplicant agreed to a post-judgment settlement to pay a total of $5,000 in monthly \npayments beginning in September 2017. At the hearing, Applicant stated that he hired an \nattorney to settle the debt and to work on other delinquent debts. Applicant agreed to pay \n$416 per month until August 2018, but at the hearing, he stated that he was late in making \npayments and was behind about $2,500. No evidence of final satisfaction of the debt has \nbeen provided. Applicant testified that consumer debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b\u20131.g have \nnot been resolved, but he intended to ask his attorney to work with the creditors. Post \nhearing, Applicant provided a letter from his attorney, indicating that she proposed waiting \nfor lawsuits before settling debts, but that she could pursue them prior to litigation if \nApplicant preferred. No evidence of substantial progress toward resolution of the debts \nhas been provided. \n \nApplicant described himself as a mentor at his employment who started new \ninitiatives. Applicant has not sought financial counseling. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \n\n \n4 \n \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record supporting the \nSOR allegations are sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions above. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant suffered a financial setback after separating from his spouse. His debts \nare long-standing and Applicant has not acted responsibly under the circumstances to \nadequately address his debts, especially before his security clearance hearing. He has \nbeen generally unable to pay or resolve delinquent debts listed in the SOR, and additional \ndebts not listed have become delinquent. In addition, he failed to file his 2016 Federal tax \nreturn when due, and owes Federal taxes for 2015 and 2016.  \n \nApplicant hired an attorney to negotiate a settlement on a judgment from a credit \ncard company, but failed to comply with the terms and has not shown that the debt is \nresolved. He has also asked his attorney for assistance with the remaining SOR debts, \nbut has not followed-up on significant and conclusive actions to resolve them. Prior to his \nhearing, Applicant submitted an offer to pay his Federal tax debt by the end of 2018. The \n\n \n6 \n \noffer was accepted by the IRS in August 2018, but Applicant testified that he was unlikely \nable to pay the debt, and has not offered evidence that the debt was satisfied. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial status was clearly impacted by his marital problems beginning \nin 2015, however he has not shown that his financial situation is unlikely to recur, or that \nhe has initiated good-faith efforts to repay his creditors or resolve his debts. I am not \nconvinced that Applicant has an effective plan to regain control of his finances. He has \nnot sought financial counseling to effectively budget his financial future, and he has not \nshown an ability, intent, or willingness to significantly address his delinquent debts in a \ntimely manner. \n \nOverall, I find that Applicant has a history of financial distress, and has not \nadequately addressed his financial and tax obligations, nor has he shown the level of \nfinancial responsibility expected of individuals holding security eligibility. I find that his \nfinancial status is not under control and, and that similar problems may recur given the \nfinancial course he is on. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (b) and (g) are partially applicable but these and the \nremaining mitigating conditions are not sufficient to overcome the concerns raised by his \nhistory of financial issues and current status. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d).3 Although adverse information concerning a single criterion \nmay not be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be \nfound ineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of \nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG \u00b6 2(e). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of \nfact and comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s marital \nissues, additional financial obligations, and long-standing employment and security \neligibility are noted, however, they do not overcome his unresolved financial and tax \ndelinquencies, inability to adequately address his debts over the last three years, and \nexhibited history of financial distress. \n \n                                                     \n3 (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to \ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age \nand maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence \nor absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n \n7 \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.i:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on November 17, \n2015. On January 10, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guidelines D and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after \nJune 8, 2017. \n03/13/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 19, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 11, 2018, \nand the case was assigned to an administrative judge on May 16, 2018. It was \nreassigned to me on November 15, 2018. On December 21, 2018, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for \nFebruary 5, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 3 were admitted in evidence without objection. GX 4 and 5 were not admitted. \nApplicant testified, presented the testimony of one witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AX) A through E, which were admitted without objection. I kept the record \nopen until February 19, 2019, to enable Applicant to submit additional documentary \nevidence. He timely submitted AX F, which was admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on February 21, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nin his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. His answer to \nthe SOR included eight exhibits (SOR Exhibits A through H). \n \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old self-employed owner and president of a federal \ncontractor that provides recovery, screening, and sanitizing of discarded information-\ntechnology (IT) materials. He has owned and operated the company since September \n2009. He was a self-employed truck driver from March 2007 to September 2009 and a \ndriver for a landscaping company from April 2005 to March 2007.  \n \n \nApplicant married in February 1986, divorced in February 1999, and married his \ncurrent spouse in February 2000. He graduated from high school and completed one \nsemester of college. He has four adult children and two adult stepchildren. His son, a \nNavy veteran, is a co-owner of his business and its facility security officer. (SOR Exhibit \nH at 1.) \n \nApplicant received a security clearance in October 2013. He submitted his most \nrecent SCA to obtain eligibility for access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI). \nHis application was denied in October 2015. (GX 2.) \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that, for several years before 2006, he and his \nwife were focused on parenting and \u201creally weren\u2019t much of a couple.\u201d In 2006, he \nseriously injured his neck and back while in heavy surf at the beach. His wife had urged \nhim not to go into the water, but he did not comply with her urging. He spent about three \nmonths wearing a \u201chalo,\u201d which immobilized his head and neck, followed by a cervical \ncollar for about four weeks. (SOR Exhibit C.) During his recovery period after he was \ninjured, his wife informed him that there would be no more sexual intimacy between \nthem. Neither spouse wanted a divorce, because it would tear apart the family. At the \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \ntime, Applicant\u2019s children were 21, 20, 17, and 13 years old. (Tr. 50-55.) He told a \nclinical psychologist that his choices were \u201cleave the marriage and break up the family, \nor go without sex, or find sex elsewhere.\u201d (AX C at 7.) \n \nNear the end of 2006, Applicant was driving a truck far from home and \nexperiencing persistent neck and back pain. He stopped at a massage parlor, and at the \nend of the massage he unexpectedly received a \u201chappy ending,\u201d by having his genitals \nmassaged to the point of orgasm. He repeated his experience about every two months. \nHis genitals were usually massaged manually and sometimes orally. He had sexual \nintercourse on two occasions. He did not feel that oral or manual stimulation was wrong, \nbut he was uncomfortable with intercourse, and he did not return to the places where \nintercourse occurred. In each case, when he received sexual services, he had not \nspecifically requested them but did not stop them. (Tr. 63.) He recognized that the \nexperience was illegal in some of the places he visited. (Tr. 56-57.)  \n \nIn the late 1990s Applicant began shoplifting food items at highway rest stops. \nHe believed that food items were \u201cludicrously overpriced,\u201d and he felt that he was \u2018being \nripped off.\u201d To compensate for the overpricing, he would take two food items but pay for \nonly one. During the years he was shoplifting, he estimated that the total value of items \ntaken was less than $100. (Tr. 59-61.) \n \nApplicant testified that in October 2014, during the interviews involved in the \nadjudication of his SCI application, he suddenly realized the seriousness and gravity of \nhis conduct. (Tr. 66.) When he went home after the interviews in which he disclosed his \nbehavior, he disclosed everything to his wife. He testified, \u201cI recognized that as painful \nof a conversation as that would be, there\u2019d be no way that I could hold a position of trust \nif I didn\u2019t do that.\u201d (Tr. 67.) His wife has forgiven him and they have become very close, \nto the extent that they communicate several times a day, even when they are \ngeographically separated. He disclosed his conduct to a close business associate and \nhis former director of security. (Tr. 70.) \n \nApplicant has not disclosed his conduct to his children, because he and his wife \nhave agreed to keep the matter as private as possible. He testified that if someone \nthreatened to disclose his conduct to his children, he would immediately notify the \nappropriate authorities, and then gather the family and fully disclose what he had done. \nHe recognizes that the children would be hurt and might not speak to him. He testified, \n\u201cMy children love me, and I love them. We would get through that without any real \ntearing the family apart, so to speak.\u201d (Tr. 85-86.)  \n \nAfter the unfavorable adjudication of his application for SCI eligibility, Applicant \nchanged his lifestyle. He had been grossly overweight, and he lost 100 pounds. He, \nstopped smoking after 37 years, and became involved in community activities. Most \nimportantly, he and his wife resumed the close and affectionate relationship that they \nenjoyed when they first married. (Tr. 71-72.) Applicant\u2019s wife submitted a statement \naffirming that she and Applicant are still in love and moving forward with their lives. She \nstated that Applicant is \u201cdoing everything in his power to atone for his prior sins.\u201d She \n\n \n4 \n \nand Applicant agreed that her personal testimony would be emotionally \u201cfar too hard.\u201d \nShe explained, \u201cWe have gone through the darkest of our times together and made it \nout to the light, but it still hurts to have to speak publicly about our dark times, and \nwriting this letter is by far easier.\u201d (AX B.) \n \nApplicant obtained outpatient psychotherapy from a licensed clinical psychologist \n(LCSW) three or four times a month from August 2015 to June 2017. He was diagnosed \nwith Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and his treatment focused on \nmanaging his hyperactivity. (SOR Exhibit E at 1.) He has been treated two or three \ntimes a month by another LCSW from July 2017 to the present. The focus is still on \nmanaging his impulsivity. The second LCSW states that Applicant \u201chas made \nconsiderable progress in his ability to regulate his impulses, and as long as he \ncontinues to maintain this progress, his prognosis is good.\u201d (SOR Exhibit E at 2.) A \npsychological evaluation conducted in April 2018 by a third LCSW found Applicant free \nfrom major psychological difficulties and histrionic personality traits. This LCSW\u2019s \nobservations and comments included the following: \n \nThe testing suggests that [Applicant] has periods of anxiety and that he \nmay be somewhat intolerant of other\u2019s shortcomings or failings. He reports \nfeeling strong aggressive and sexual drives and he is highly sensitive to \nrejection. . . . He may feel slighted if he is not receiving what he wants \nfrom a relationship. . . .  \n \nHe has periods where he feels self-remorse and low self-esteem \ncharacterized by not feeling that he is \u201cas good\u201d as others. He may try to \nprotect himself in relationships by detaching himself, which fits with his \nreported history of difficulty with emotional and physical intimacy. This also \nhelps \nexplain \nhow \nhe \nsought \ngratification \nthrough \nanonymous \nrelationships that do not require emotions or commitment. These \ntendencies are not likely to impact on employment matters but affect his \ninterpersonal relationships and his private life. These issues are also not \ninflexible and can be moderated, particularly since he is involved in \ncounseling and aware of them. . . .  \n \nIndividuals with these personality tendencies may have some struggle with \ntheir closest relationships and intimacy but are inclined to excel \nprofessionally in their occupational setting where they are able to fulfil their \naffiliative needs and find positive reinforcement for their behavior. They \nare often found to be hard working, reliable, dedicated and highly \nproductive individuals due to these factors. . . . \n \n[Applicant\u2019s] focal behavioral lapses of the past appear to be anomalies \nbased on unusual circumstances that are not likely to happen again and \nthat do not represent his normal behavior. These issues are now well \nunderstood and have ceased. There is no indication that this illicit \n\n \n5 \n \nbehavior will ever reoccur, and he appears to be capable of holding a \nposition of trust as he has successfully done for years prior. \n \n(AX C; AX D.) \n \nApplicant began neurofeedback treatment in June 2017 to help him control his \nimpulsivity. (Tr. 73.) His neurofeedback counselor submitted the following comments: \n \nIn my experience with [Applicant], he has consistently presented himself \nas a forthright, honest individual with an excellent work ethic and high \npersonal integrity. He has a high level of self-awareness and personal \ninsight and has been able to provide honest, comprehensive self-reports \nof functioning and reactions to training. . . . Neurofeedback has helped \n[Applicant] with increased self-awareness and control and maintenance \nof an appropriate level of psychophysiological arousal that maximizes \nattention, focus, working memory and executive functioning capabilities. \n \n(AX E.) \n \nApplicant testified that he did not make his lifestyle changes to enable him to \nreceive a clearance; he made the changes because going through the adjudication \nprocess put him in touch with \u201chow awful [he] was.\u201d He testified: \u201cInside was awful, and I \nneed to fix that. It was a catalyst, if you will, but no, I didn\u2019t become a better person to \nget a clearance. I want to be a person who\u2019s worthy of a clearance, with or without the \nclearance.\u201d (Tr. 78.) He submitted a \u201cStatement of Intent\u201d agreeing to revocation of any \nsecurity clearance if he engages in shoplifting or receives the services of prostitutes in \nthe future. (AX A.) \n \n \nA defense contractor who relied on Applicant as a subcontractor for many years \ntestified that he regarded Applicant as a \u201cvalued partner,\u201d who was very competent, \nmeticulous, and dedicated. Applicant disclosed his sexual conduct and shoplifting to this \ndefense contractor, who was surprised but would not hesitate to work with him again. \n(Tr. 22-28.) The defense contractor\u2019s facility security officer was especially impressed \nwith Applicant\u2019s meticulous attention and aggressive responses to potential spillages \nfrom IT hardware. (SOR Exhibit H at 8; AX F.) A former co-worker regards Applicant as \nextremely security conscious, dedicated, and knowledgeable. (SOR Exhibit H at 3.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 33-year-old stepson admires him for teaching him the value of hard \nwork and the importance of family and friends. (SOR Exhibit H at 2.) His 25-year-old \nstepson remembers him as a loving and caring father-figure, extremely generous, \ntalented, and a great leader. (SOR Exhibit H at 5.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 29-year-old daughter describes him as extremely patriotic, honest, \nand hard-working. She admires him for teaching her the value of hard work, teamwork, \nhonesty, and time management. (SOR Exhibit H at 4.) His 25-year-old daughter \nremembers how Applicant taught her about honesty and hard work. She describes him \n\n \n6 \n \nas \u201can amazing father, friendly neighbor, caring friend, loving husband, and most \nimportantly, a patriot.\u201d (SOR Exhibit H at 6. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that, from approximately 2006 to approximately 2014, \nApplicant paid money for sexual gratification. The concern under this guideline is set out \nin AG 12:  \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions establish the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 13(a): sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the \nindividual has been prosecuted; \n \nAG \u00b6 13(b): a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual \nbehavior that the individual is unable to stop; and \n \nAG \u00b6 13(c): sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 14(b): the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \n\n \n8 \n \nAG \u00b6 14(c): the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; \n \nAG \u00b6 14(d): the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and \ndiscreet; and \n \nAG \u00b6 14(e): the individual has successfully completed an appropriate \nprogram of treatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated \nongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has \nreceived a favorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional \nindicating the behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(e) are established. Applicant\u2019s sexual misbehavior and petty \ntheft stopped more than four years ago. His debilitating and painful injury, followed by \nhis wife\u2019s termination of marital intimacy, were unusual circumstances that left him \nfeeling angry and rejected. He now understands what contributed to his conduct and \nhas obtained counseling to deal with it. The medical professionals who have assisted \nhim believe that recurrence is unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14(c) is not fully established. Applicant has disclosed his conduct to his \nwife, but not to his children and stepchildren. Thus, he remains vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. However, he found the courage to disclose his misconduct to his \nwife and a close business associate, and I am confident that he will muster the strength \nto disclose his misconduct to his children and stepchildren if necessary. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14(d) is not established. Applicant visited the massage parlors alone, and \nhis sexual activity was private and consensual, but it was not discreet. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant engaged in shoplifting for about 35-40 years \nuntil 2014. SOR \u00b6 2.b cross-alleges SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions establish the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \n\n \n9 \n \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (2) \nany disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; [and] (3) a pattern \nof dishonesty or rule violations; . . .  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such \nconduct includes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect \nthe person's personal, professional, or community standing . . . ; and \n \nAG \u00b6 16(g); association with persons involved in criminal activity. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; \n \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(g): association with persons involved in criminal activities was \nunwitting, has ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast \ndoubt upon the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) are established for the reasons set out in the above \ndiscussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(e). AG \u00b6 17(e) is not fully established for the reasons \n\n \n10 \n \nset out in the above discussion of AG \u00b6 14(c). AG \u00b6 17(g) is established, because \nApplicant no longer visits massage parlors engaged in illegal prostitution. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines D and E in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but \nsome warrant additional comment. Applicant was candid, sincere, remorseful, and \ncredible at the hearing. Before his injury and the disintegration of his marriage in 2006, \nhe held a security clearance without incident. His reconciliation with his wife, her strong \nsupport, and his continuing treatment by medical professionals are major factors making \nrecurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines D and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his sexual behavior and \npersonal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D (Sexual Behavior): \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n                                                          \n2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n11 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

Tilford, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Ronald C. Sykstus, Esq. \n \n06/13/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. Eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 29, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence. Applicant responded to the SOR on November 23, 2018, and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On February 4, 2019, he \nchanged his request to a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was \nassigned to me on March 14, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled on May 9, \n2019. Department Counsel amended the SOR at the hearing by withdrawing SOR \nparagraphs 1.c and 1.d. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nEvidence \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified, called seven witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough PP, which were admitted without objection. \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Egypt. Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained \nin the request. The facts are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated \nverbatim in this decision. Applicant submitted additional information about Egypt. (AE X) \nI have also taken administrative notice of facts about Egypt from the U.S. Department of \nState website. Egypt is a republic governed by an elected president and unicameral \nlegislature. The United States and Egypt share a strong partnership based on mutual \ninterest in Middle East peace and stability, economic opportunity, and regional security. \nPromoting a stable, prosperous Egypt, where the government protects the basic rights \nof its citizens and fulfills the aspirations of the Egyptian people, will continue to be a \ncore objective of U.S. policy. I also note the significant threat of terrorism and ongoing \nhuman rights problems in Egypt. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis employer or a predecessor company for about 13 years. He is applying for a security \nclearance for the first time. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree. He is \nmarried with four children. \n \n \nApplicant was born in the United States to Egyptian parents. His father worked \nfor the Egyptian government and was assigned to the United States. Applicant returned \nto Egypt with his family when he was about three years old. He grew up and was \neducated in Egypt, but he often visited the United States and always planned to \neventually move back here. He was hired by a U.S. company after college and worked \nin Egypt until about 2013. His job required him to travel frequently to the United States. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is from Egypt, and they were married in Egypt. Two of their \nchildren were born in Egypt and two were born in the United States. All of their children \nare U.S. citizens. Applicant moved his family to the United States in 2011. From 2011 to \n2013, he divided his time between Egypt and the United states. He moved permanently \nto the United States in 2013. His wife became a U.S. citizen in 2016. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is deceased. His mother, brother, parents-in-law, and two \nsiblings-in-law are citizens and residents of Egypt. His mother is a retired school teacher \nin poor health. His brother works in finance. Applicant\u2019s brother stays with his mother \nand takes care of her. Applicant talks to his mother and brother regularly because he \nwants to check on her. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parent-in-laws are retired with medical conditions. His siblings-in-law \nwork for private companies. Applicant talks to his parents-in-laws about once a month \nwhen his wife talks to them. He talks to his wife\u2019s siblings less often. \n \n \nApplicant owns the apartment in Egypt where he used to live. He estimated its \nvalue at $40,000. It is for sale. He does not have any other assets in Egypt. Applicant \nowns his house in the United States as well as the house next store, which he rents to a \ntenant. He has about $81,000 in a retirement account. He credibly testified that his \nfamily and property in Egypt could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing \nclassified information, and that he would report any attempt to do so. \n \nApplicant is active in his community. He is a volunteer firefighter who was named \nVolunteer Firefighter of the Year in 2015. He started the process to join the National \nGuard in 2017, but when his wife became pregnant, he decided it would require too \nmuch time away from a pregnant wife and three young children. Seven witnesses \ntestified on his behalf, and he submitted numerous documents and letters attesting to \nhis civic involvement, patriotism, honesty, loyalty, strong moral character, and \noutstanding job performance.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG paragraph 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \nparagraph 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nUnder Directive paragraph E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive paragraph E3.1.15, the \napplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG paragraph 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG paragraph 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n\n \n5 \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology;  \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \n \nThere is a significant threat of terrorism and ongoing human rights problems in \nEgypt. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and property create a potential conflict of interest \nand a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion, both directly and through his wife. The above disqualifying conditions have \nbeen raised by the evidence.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG paragraph 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Egypt. Egypt is a republic governed \nby an elected president and unicameral legislature. The United States and Egypt share \na strong partnership based on mutual interest in Middle East peace and stability, \neconomic opportunity, and regional security. Guideline B is not limited to countries \nhostile to the United States. The United States has a compelling interest in protecting \n\n \n6 \n \nand safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is \nnot authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States. \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made \nwith caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and \nunexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen. His wife and four children are in the United \nStates and are U.S. citizens. He is a valued employee and a dedicated member of his \ncommunity. He was named Volunteer Firefighter of the Year in 2015. With the exception \nof the apartment in Egypt that is for sale, all of his assets are in the United States.  \nI find that Applicant\u2019s ties to Egypt are outweighed by his deep and long-standing \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States. His closest family, life, home, majority of \nhis assets, and professional career are in the United States. I find that it is unlikely he \nwill be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the United \nStates and the interests of Egypt. There is no conflict of interest, because he can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. The above \nmitigating conditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG paragraph 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nUnder AG paragraph 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. I also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s strong character evidence. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \n \n \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Weber, Esquire \n10/02/2019\n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns regarding psychological conditions. \nEligibility for a security clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 11, 2012, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted \nan Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On January 24, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016), for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline I (Psychological Conditions), \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a notarized statement, dated February 20, 2018, Applicant responded to the \nSOR and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel \nindicated the Government was prepared to proceed on April 13, 2018. The case was \nassigned to me on January 10, 2019.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 13, 2019. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled on April 2, 2019. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 7, and Applicant \nexhibits (AE) A through AE E were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant \nand four witnesses testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 11, 2019. I kept the \nrecord open to enable Applicant to supplement it. He took advantage of that opportunity \nand timely submitted several documents which were marked and admitted as AE F \nthrough AE Z without objection. The record closed on June 3, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant partially admitted, with comments, three of the \nfactual allegations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.). He denied the remaining \nallegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of \nfact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due \nconsideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a maintenance control lead with his current employer since February 2010. He \npreviously served as a product handler with a chemical company from March 2008 until \nFebruary 2010. He is a 1996 high school graduate, with some college credits, but no \ndegree. Appellant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in October 2001, and he served on active \nduty until August 2007, when he was honorably discharged as an airman 1st class (E-3). \nSeveral months before his discharge, Applicant was disciplined by Article 15, Uniform \nCode of Military Justice (UCMJ) for violating a no-contact order with his estranged wife, \nand he was reduced in grade from senior airman (E-4). (AE A; GE 2, at 15-19) Applicant \nwas married in 2001, and divorced in 2008. He remarried in 2008. He has two children, \nborn in 2004 and 2016. He was granted a top secret clearance in 2003.  \n \nMilitary Awards and Decorations \n \n \nDuring his military career, Appellant received the Air Force Achievement Medal, \nAir Force Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Global War on \nTerrorism Service Medal, the Air Force Longevity Service Award; the Air Force Training \nRibbon, and the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award. (AE A (Certificate of Release or \nDischarge from Active Duty (DD Form 214)) He was also the recipient of numerous letters \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nof appreciation issued by his commanders during the period 2003 to 2006. He was \nrepeatedly recognized as the staff professional of his squadron and group. (AE C) \n \nPsychological Conditions  \n \n \nIn April 2003, Applicant was diagnosed by the flight commander of the Life Skills \nSupport Center (LSSC) \u2013 a member of the Biomedical Sciences Corps (BSC) \u2013 as having \nan adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, in part because of \nmarital issues involving his wife\u2019s $200 bar bill and a traumatic incident, described by his \nwife as an assault upon her by an instructor during a business trip. Applicant was referred \nto a family practice physician, and prescribed Xanax, a sedative used to treat anxiety and \npanic disorder. His case was closed on April 14, 2003, with no follow-up required. (GE 5 \n(Medical Records), at 25-30)  \n \n \nDuring 2004, Applicant and his pregnant wife were in the midst of marital discord \nand hostility, which eventually erupted into an ugly divorce and continuing child custody \nbattles involving the police, the courts, the command, and military medical personnel. On \nMay 12, 2004, Applicant started experiencing panic attacks, blurred vision, and dizziness, \nso he sought emergency medical assistance. He was diagnosed with panic attack and \nadministered a low dose of Temazepam \u2013 used to treat anxiety and insomnia. He was \nreleased. (GE 6 (Medical Records), at 79-90)  \n \n \nThe following day, Applicant voluntarily went to the Life Skills Support Clinic at the \nbase, where he was diagnosed by another LSSC flight commander as having Axis I: panic \ndisorder without agoraphobia (fear of places and situations), and V61.1 problems with \nsocial environment \u2013 partner relationship problem, and he was scheduled for inquiry and \ncounseling for marital conflict. He was prescribed Paxil and Ativan as needed \u2013 both \nantidepressant medications approved for the treatment of anxiety. (GE 5, at 19-24) On \nMay 19, 2004, after a 45-minute interview for marital and partner problems, unspecified, \nhe was again diagnosed with the same Axis I disorders, and he was again released. He \nwas seen again for the same issues on June 2, 2004 (for 50 minutes); June 15, 2004 (for \n35 minutes); and again on July 6, 2004 (for 35 minutes), and was released without \nlimitations. The July 6th diagnosis noted that the Axis I panic disorder without agoraphobia \nwas improved. Applicant needed no further follow up and the case was closed. (GE 5, at \n15-18; GE 6, at 109-113) \n \n \nThere is one medical record in evidence that is inaccurate. It states that an incident \noccurred on November 28, 2004, when Applicant was 28 years old (that encounter and \nrecord could not have taken place in 2004, because Applicant was only 26-years old on \nthat date). On that date, Applicant\u2019s 1st sergeant supposedly referred him to the chief, \nsocial work services, a licensed clinical social worker, because of allegations that \nApplicant had threatened to kill his wife and daughter, as well as kill himself. Applicant \ndenied the allegations, and noted that he and his wife were separated, and she was \nhaving an affair with a former friend. When he reported the situation to his commander, \nthe commander issued a no-contact order against him. However, no such order was \nissued in 2004. A No Contact Order was issued against Applicant on February 13, 2007, \nand again on April 30, 2007. (AE Y) Regardless of the date in issue, Applicant denied any \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nsuicidal or homicidal ideations. Despite the nature of the allegations, no immediate follow-\nup was ordered in the record, and Applicant was released. (GE 5, at 13) \n \n \n \nOn November 29, 2006, a command-directed evaluation was ordered, and \nApplicant went to the Mental Health Clinic. He was reportedly evaluated on that date and \non December 1, 2006, when he was seen for 45 minutes regarding the adjustment \ndisorder issues. Although Applicant denied any suicidal or homicidal ideations, \u201cgiven \nincongruent corroborating information, he was determined to be at significant risk of \npotential suicidal and/or homicidal action.\u201d The \u201cincongruent corroborating information\u201d \nwas not described or identified. The licensed clinical psychologist and the life skills \nelement chief concluded that Applicant \u201creflected delusions of persecution but no \nhallucinations.\u201d The specifics of the \u201cdelusions\u201d were not described or identified. They \nreported a diagnosis of Axis I: 300.01, V61.1, as well as rule out delusional disorder, \npersecutory type \u2013 an illness characterized by at least one month of delusions but no \nother psychotic symptoms. His Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale was 50, \nlowered to 45: serious symptoms. (GE 5, at 9-12) At some point, Applicant was prescribed \nEffexor \u2013 used to treat depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. \nApplicant chose to not attend a follow-up appointment with the licensed clinical \npsychologist. (GE 5, at 8) On December 19-20, 2006, he was again seen by the clinical \nsocial worker regarding administrative purposes. (GE 6, at 75-89) \n \n \nOn February 26, 2007, Applicant presented himself at the clinic to be evaluated for \nallegedly making statements regarding killing his wife and child, comments he denied \nmaking, in anticipation of appearing in court the following day. Despite displaying no \npsychotic signs or paranoia, and denying any suicidal intent or plan, and having intact \njudgment, it was determined that he was \u201ca moderate risk to self and/or others based \nupon the apparent discrepancy in reports and history even though he currently denies \n[suicidal ideation/homicidal ideation],\u201d and he was diagnosed as follows: Axis I: V61.12 \nphysical abuse of adult. The previous disorder 300.01 was not mentioned. The specifics \nof the \u201capparent discrepancy in reports and history\u201d as well as the basis for the V61.12 \ndiagnosis were not described or identified. Despite the moderate risk that Applicant \nsupposedly displayed, he was not scheduled to be seen in a follow up for another week. \n(GE 5, at 7) \n \n \nOn March 23, 2007, Applicant was seen in the Family Advocacy Center for a \nfollow-up appointment. He reported that he had been disciplined and deemed ineligible \nfor reenlistment, and was scheduled to separate from active duty in August 2007. \nApparently despondent over the entire turn of events, he said that the Air Force had failed \nhim and he no longer had any use for it. He also said that \u201chitting a woman or child is \nintolerable.\u201d (GE 5, at 5) The record reports that in a previous visit, without specifying the \ndate of that visit, Applicant said that \u201cthis uniform and his daughter keep him from harming \nhis wife and her alleged boyfriend.\u201d A report of such comments does not appear in any of \nthe medical records submitted to me. Upon being questioned by the family advocacy \nofficer, Applicant reportedly made several comments about his past as a member of the \nItalian mafia, harming various individuals and intimidating others, but he later disputed \nthat scenario, claiming that he was merely discussing a television show, The Sopranos, \nand song lyrics. (Tr. at 91-94, 115-116) When asked if he wanted to harm his wife and \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nher alleged boyfriend, he responded that if he wanted to do so, \u201cthey\u2019d be gone already.\u201d \nHe was diagnosed as follows: Axis I: V61.12 perpetrator of spouse abuse, and Axis II: \n301.81 narcissistic personality disorder, meets criteria 1 (grandiose sense of self-\nimportance), 2 (preoccupied with fantasies), 5 (sense of entitlement), 7 (lacks empathy), \nand 9 (shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes). (GE 5, at 6; Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Disorders, 4th Edition \u2013 Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), at 717) The \nprevious disorder 300.01 was not mentioned. There is no explanation regarding the basis \nof the source of the diagnosis \u201cperpetrator of spouse abuse,\u201d or the conclusions pertaining \nto the criteria supporting the Axis II disorder. Despite the comments made, Applicant was \nnot deemed to be suicidal or homicidal, and the risk remained moderate. He was \nscheduled to return in two weeks for a risk assessment. \n \n \nThereafter, on three different occasions in April 2007, May 2007, and August 2007, \nApplicant was reportedly seen by the same licensed clinical psychologist. The same \ndiagnoses were carried over without any new evaluations. The April 2007 mental health \nrecord indicated that a Treatment Team Meeting (TTM) was conducted, and that a full \nFamily Advocacy (FA) report was attached. No such report was in the file. (GE 5, at 4) \nDuring the May 2007 session, one week before Applicant was scheduled to commence \nhis terminal leave (May 11, 2007), Applicant stated that during his last session with a \nparticular provider, he \u201cfinally talked about his real issues.\u201d There is no medical record in \nevidence to reflect that particular session. No diagnostic changes were made. (GE 5, at \n2-3) Although there was no session conducted thereafter, there is a Mental Health Record \nmade by the licensed clinical psychologist that the record was being closed. That record \ncontains the following statement: \u201cthe impact of the treatment of military was \nadministratively discharged from active duty service based on the results of the \n[Command Directed Evaluation] and diagnosis of personality disorder.\u201d (GE 5, at 1) That \ncharacterization is patently false, and without any basis in fact, and the source of the \ncomment is not known. Separation action was never initiated, and the Separation Code \non Applicant\u2019s DD Form 214 was expiration of term of service, and his Reentry Code was \nserving suspended punishment to Art. 15. (AE A; Tr. at 99-100) \n \n \nDespite a plethora of clinical notes and session reports, none of the Air Force \nhealthcare providers who interviewed, evaluated, diagnosed, or treated Applicant actually \nperformed a mental health evaluation as described in DOD Instruction (DODI) 6490.4, \nRequirements for Mental Health Evaluations of Members of the Armed Forces (August \n28, 1997); DOD Instruction 6490.1, Mental Health Evaluations of Members of the Armed \nForces (October 1, 1997); or The American Psychiatric Association (APA) Practice \nGuideline for the Psychiatric Evaluation of Adults, 2nd Edition (June 2006). A mental health \nevaluation under DODI 6490.4 shall consist of, at a minimum: \n \nA clinical interview and mental status examination and may include, \nadditionally: a review of medical records; a review of other records, such as \nthe Service personnel record; information forwarded by the Service \nmember\u2019s commanding officer; psychological testing; physical examination; \nand laboratory and/or other specialized testing. Interviews conducted by \nthe Family Advocacy Program . . . are not considered mental health \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nevaluations for the purpose of [DODI 6490.1 . . . and [DODI 6490.4]. \n(Emphasis supplied) (DODI 6490.4, Enc. 2, \u00a7 E2.1.6) \n  \nThere are the repeated presence of terms such as suicidal ideation, homicidal \nideation, and depression in the clinical records, but not one of the clinical records in \nevidence indicates that any psychological testing was administered. There is no mention \nof the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, 2nd revised version (MMPI-2), used \nfor measuring adult psychopathology; the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-\nSSRS) to gather lifetime history of suicidality as well as any recent suicidal ideation or \nbehavior; the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) to assess emotional and \npersonality functioning; the Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale - 24 (BASIS \u2013 24) \nto assess the outcome of mental health or substance abuse treatment from the client\u2019s \nperspective; the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory, 3rd Edition (MCMI-III) to measure 24 \npersonality disorders in assisting clinicians in psychiatric diagnoses, developing a \ntreatment approach, and guiding treatment decisions; the Patient Health Questionnaire \n(PHQ-2) to screen, diagnose, monitor, and measure the severity of depression; the \nPatient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to screen, diagnose, monitor, and measure the \nseverity of depression; the Screening for Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 2 (GAD - 2), to \nscreen generalized anxiety; or the Screening for Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7 (GAD \n- 7) to screen generalized anxiety.  \n \nMoreover, while there are several diagnoses, the clinicians failed to indicate why \nor how those impressions were specifically reached. Applicant repeatedly denied suicidal \nideations despite constant probing about his reported disorders. He felt that he was \nwrongfully suspected of having suicidal ideations or homicidal ideations, as well as what \nhe considered false allegations against him by his wife and her boyfriend, and he was \ndisappointed that the Air Force had failed him in summarily believing the worst about him, \nand disciplining him. At that point, he simply quit and started discussing the Italian mafia, \na television show, and some song lyrics. His position was seen as reluctance, sometimes \nreferred to as resistance, and was considered unacceptable, and it was not otherwise \nexamined or analyzed by the clinicians, although such an action is acknowledged in \npsychoanalysis.  \n \nSigmund Freud defined resistance as \u201cwhatever interrupts the progress of analytic \nwork,\u201d such as being late, missing a session, \u201cholding back\u201d your thoughts in the moment \n(i.e., refusing to speak about them) or avoiding a particular issue. In its most simple and \npractical sense, resistance results from fear. On the other hand, Jacques Lacan, a French \npsychoanalyst and psychiatrist, warned not to confuse resistance with defense and \nformulated the famous statement that \u201cthere is no other resistance to analysis than that \nof the analyst himself.\u201d In other words, if the psychotherapist makes interpretations or \ninterventions that are clinically inaccurate, the client will get defensive, and that will \ninterrupt the therapeutic work. In plain English, this means that a client will only explore \ntherapeutic material so far as is comfortable in the moment; the psychotherapist, \ntherefore, must always be aware of just how far the client is willing to go and not \u201cpush\u201d \nthe client beyond these temporary limits. Imprudent attempts to push a client can end up \npushing the client right out of psychotherapy, which seems to be the reason why Applicant \nchose not to fully participate in it. (http://www.guidetopsychology.com/btypes.htm, citing \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nSigmund Freud, The Interpretation of Dreams (Second Part), in Vol. V, The standard \nedition of the complete psychological works of Sigmund Freud (1953), at p. 517; Jacques \nLacan, \u201cThe Freudian thing, or the meaning of the return to Freud in psychoanalysis.\u201d In \n\u00c9crits: A selection, trans. Alan Sheridan (1977), at p. 129; Jacques Lacan, \u201cThe direction \nof the treatment and the principles of its power.\u201d In \u00c9crits: A selection, trans. Alan \nSheridan (1977), at p. 235.) \n \nAs noted above, Applicant\u2019s relationship with his wife eventually erupted into an \nugly divorce and continuing child custody battles involving the police, the courts, the \ncommand, and military medical personnel. His wife started filing actions against him \nshortly before she filed for divorce. First there were allegations that Applicant had \nthreatened her and their daughter as well as a report that Applicant had threatened his \nwife\u2019s boyfriend, both of which severely limited Applicant\u2019s access to his daughter, and \nresulted in the issuance of protective orders against Applicant, as well as his being \ndiagnosed for physical abuse of an adult. There are no statements from either Applicant\u2019s \nwife or her boyfriend in evidence to support any of those actions. The Military Protective \nOrder cites as the sole basis for the issuance of the order that Applicant\u2019s wife \u201cis \nconcerned for her safety and [Applicant has] shown behavior that could be interpreted as \nthreatening.\u201d (AE Y). Applicant was subsequently disciplined and reduced in grade for \nreportedly violating the no-contact orders, despite his assertions that her allegations were \nbaseless. Without substantially more information, there is nothing upon which to interpret \nthreatening behavior, or violations. Likewise, there is no information, statement, or police \nreport to support the basis for the issuance of no-contact orders, temporary injunctions, \nor the disciplinary punishment. \n \nDuring 2006 and 2007, there were a number of temporary injunctions for protection \nagainst domestic violence with minor children filed against Applicant (AE H; AE J; AE L), \nas well as an attempt to acquire child custody (AE I); and motions for extensions of \ninjunction from protection against domestic violence. (AE K; AE Q) Applicant had to file a \nmotion for contempt and imposition of sanctions against his wife in 2007, because she \nrefused to comply with his child visitation rights. (AE P) The Final Judgment of Divorce \nwas entered January 16, 2008. (AE G) Applicant\u2019s ex-wife filed three motions for civil \ncontempt against Applicant in 2012, but all of them were denied, including one for a late \npayment of $5.25 as part of a check that she refused to accept. (AE W) She also claimed \nthat Applicant had sexually abused their daughter in 2012, but that charge was \nsubsequently dropped. \n \nOn October 2, 2012, on January 23, 2013, and again on March 20, 2013, Applicant \nattended a Deprivation Hearing, based on a complaint filed on behalf of Applicant\u2019s ex-\nwife. During that hearing, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife testified that before their divorce, Applicant \npurchased a handgun and threatened to shoot her with it and take their daughter away. \nShe reported the threat and the military took his weapon away. When he did it a second \ntime, another handgun was taken from him, and under the local Baker Act \u2013 an existing \nlaw that provides for temporary institutionalization of individuals who meet certain criteria. \nIt can only be used by specific authorized persons, including judges, mental health \nprofessionals, law enforcement personnel, and doctors. More importantly, the law is \nlimited by the fact that those officials must have sound evidence suggesting that the \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nindividual might meet the Act\u2019s definition for mental illness. In addition, he must pose a \nrisk of harm to himself or others \u2013 or demonstrate self-neglect. It should be noted that the \nstatutory criteria require more than mere suspicion of mental illness or potential risk. The \nstatute specifically calls for \u201csubstantial\u201d evidence, which is much higher bar than simple \nsuspicion. As a result, people cannot be involuntarily institutionalized simply because \nthey\u2019re acting strangely, refuse to seek psychiatric examinations, or have occasional \nmood swings or outbursts.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife described their daughter as always crying before, during, and \nafter her interactions with Applicant. However, the guardian ad litem expressed that she \nhad no concerns about the child being around Applicant or his weapons. Nevertheless, \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife argued that Applicant should be disqualified from possessing a \nconcealed weapon because he had been in a mental hospital. (AE W) The matter was \nfinally dropped, and Applicant was, once again, granted full visitation rights. \n \nIn 2017, the DOD CAF referred Applicant for a psychological evaluation. He was \ninterviewed for an unspecified period and administered only one psychological test: the \nPAI, but the results of that test were deemed invalid. In a psychological report, dated \nNovember 21, 2017, that clinician noted that she had reviewed \u201cthe medical record,\u201d \nwithout identifying any of the specific documents, and she discounted several of \nApplicant\u2019s comments as being at odds with information that was in the unidentified \nmaterials furnished to her by the DOD CAF: that he has a history of hospitalization for \nsuicidal and homicidal ideation; that he had been discharged due to the results of a \ncommand directed evaluation and diagnosis of personality disorder; that a review of \nmedical records indicates scenarios involving threats to his ex-wife\u2019s boyfriend; that \nApplicant\u2019s denials regarding threats of violence to his ex-wife and her now-husband are \ninconsistent with the accounts of events in the records furnished; that Applicant\u2019s denials \nof any history of suicidal or homicidal ideation are refuted by the records to the contrary; \nthat he denied other events that are noted within the record; that he tends to portray \nhimself as being exceptionally free of common shortcomings to which most individuals \nwill admit; and that Applicant\u2019s comments regarding disputed information is considered to \nbe of questionable validity. (GE 3) The psychologist concluded: \n \nApplicant has a documented history of narcissistic personality disorder, but \ninterestingly also shows some of the atypical thinking (unusual beliefs, \nparanoia), odd speech, and social skill deficits (lack of close friends, social \nawkwardness) commonly seen in an individual with schizotypal personality \ndisorder. \n \nThe diagnosis in this case would render the patient in need of consistent \ntreatment (until symptoms remit, which is uncommon with diagnosis of this \nnature), but this has clearly not occurred at this point. My prognosis is poor, \ngiven the ingrained nature of his issues and poor likelihood for treatment \ncompliance. His psychological symptoms could certainly impede his \njudgment. . . Based upon his legal history, volatile mood and behaviors, and \nhis history of interpersonal conflicts, it appears that [Applicant] is likely to \nhave impaired reliability. (GE 3) \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n \nBecause of the lack of specificity in the psychological report, especially when it \ncomes to source documentation upon which Applicant\u2019s comments were not accepted, \nas well as to the source documentation or other information upon which the psychologist \nrelied to find the presence of unusual beliefs, paranoia, odd speech, and social skill \ndeficits (lack of close friends, social awkwardness), and the absence of psychological \ntesting, it is unclear if the psychologist complied with the requirements of DODI 6490.4, \nMental Health Evaluations of Members of the Military Services (March 4, 2013); DOD \nInstruction 6490.1, Mental Health Evaluations of Members of the Armed Forces (October \n1, 1997); or even the APA Practice Guidelines for the Psychiatric Evaluation of Adults \u2013 \n3rd Edition (2016). In this regard, while Applicant is not currently a member of the military \nservices, it remains unclear if the DODIs have been adopted for DOD CAF purposes with \nrespect to government contractors. Accordingly, the thoroughness and accuracy of the \nevaluation report remain open to question. \nWork Performance and Character References \n \n \nThe former officer-in charge of the unit where Applicant served between October \n2004 and July 2006, stated that Applicant displayed exceptional positive characteristics \nin duty performance, leadership qualities and in his personal life. His dedication to the \nmission was always exhibited through outstanding performance. He volunteered for \nseveral events. Off duty, Applicant attended church and played softball for his church \nteam. Applicant was one of his hardest-working, knowledgeable troops that he would not \nonly want working in his section, but one day running it. (AE B) \nThe former operations officer of the squadron considered Applicant to be a critical \nmember of the unit whose performance was never less than exceptional. Applicant\u2019s duty \nperformance, military bearing, and professionalism were of the highest level. Not only \nwas he skilled in his primary duties, but he continuously sought additional workload to \nease the burden on fellow colleagues. He would, without hesitation, bank on Applicant\u2019s \nability to accomplish any task presented to him.  (AE B) \nThe former superintendent of the maintenance operations flight described \nApplicant\u2019s professionalism, military bearing and duty performance to be of the highest \nlevel. He supported the squadron booster club by donating his time to help raise funds \nfor the squadron\u2019s holiday party and other activities, and was an avid supporter of the \nlocal community, helping to build homes for Habitat for Humanity. (AE B) \nCurrent coworkers, including the president of the local union, have described him \nin stressful and complicated situations requiring high levels of patience, intelligence, and \nunderstanding, and Applicant met every challenge, deadline, and goal presented and \ntackled every problem with grace and ease. Many of Applicant\u2019s solutions were insightful \nand practical, and he showed a remarkable capacity for breaking large issues into \nmanageable segments. Applicant is also a cooperative and attentive team player. His \nactions consistently inspired and motivated other employees in the office. Applicant was \ninstrumental in assisting members who are out of work, as well as assisting those affected \nby a hurricane. He has always been honest and forthcoming. (AE B)  \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nOne character witness met Applicant in 2002 when the witness was newly \nstationed at the same base. Applicant opened his home to the new arrival and invited him \nto the house for the 4th of July celebrations. He noted that Applicant was always receiving \nawards because he was a top airman.  Applicant was always willing to give his shirt off \nhis back for people. He never saw Applicant become angry or enraged. As time went on, \nthe witness and Applicant and his wife did many things together, and Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with his wife seemed normal. Things changed when Applicant\u2019s wife started \ndating another individual who was residing in their home. It was the witness\u2019s impression \nthat Applicant\u2019s wife would \u201ccry wolf\u201d and be vengeful. At one point, while the witness was \nresiding in Applicant\u2019s house, Applicant\u2019s wife lied when she said that the witness had \ncornered her in the kitchen \u2013 something that never happened \u2013 so he immediately moved \nout of the house. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s boyfriend kept threatening Applicant for years, saying \nthat he was going to \u201ckick his butt.\u201d As Applicant\u2019s marital situation became more \nantagonistic, it was the witness\u2019s impression that the unit leadership was supportive of \nApplicant, but the Command was simply trying to cover themselves by following protocol. \nThe witness has never seen Applicant display any suicidal or homicidal ideation. He \nbelieves Applicant is trustworthy and has integrity. (Tr. at 22-20) \nOne character witness has known Applicant since they were in the same military \nunit. After Applicant relocated, they met one day at a local store, and Applicant told him \nabout an employment opening, and they have been with the same employer since \nNovember 2010. Before joining the same organization, the witness served as a police \nofficer. The witness was aware of Applicant\u2019s marital situation, hearing about it from other \npeople, and seeing Applicant\u2019s reactions. There were threats, legal action, unnecessary \nlegal action, and going after money by the ex-wife and her now husband. He has never \nseen Applicant lose his temper or act irrationally. Applicant has come to his aid and helped \nmove the witness\u2019s mother. About 12 or 13 years ago, the Command issued a be-on-the \nlookout (BOLO) flyer on Applicant. Applicant\u2019s reputation as a coworker is spectacular. \n(Tr. at 34-47; AE B) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The standard that must be \nmet is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness are such that granting the person access to classified information is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, the administrative \njudge applies these guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. The concept recognizes that we should \nview a person by the totality of his or her acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. \nEach case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant \ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. \n \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  Furthermore, security clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. (Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the \nrecord. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nAt the outset, I note I had ample opportunity to evaluate the demeanor of Applicant, \nobserve his manner and deportment, appraise the way in which he responded to \nquestions, assess his candor or evasiveness, read his statements, and listen to his \ntestimony. It is my impression that his explanations regarding his psychological conditions \nissues are consistent and have the solid resonance of truth. \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, including those in the DOD CAF \ncase file, those submitted by Applicant, and his testimony, and the testimony of others, \nas well as an assessment of Applicant=s demeanor and credibility, and after application \nof all appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to the \nallegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set \nout in AG \u00b6 27: \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 28:  \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors;  \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and  \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nIn 2006, Applicant\u2019s wife and her boyfriend made allegations to the police and the \nCommand that Applicant had threatened to kill them and Applicant\u2019s daughter, as well as \nkill himself. No-contact orders were issued to Applicant by the Command; he was directed \nto undergo a mental health evaluation; it was determined that Applicant was at significant \nrisk of potential suicidal and/or homicidal action; it was later determined that he was a \nmoderate risk to self and/or others; he was reported to be in violation of the no-contact \norders; he was disciplined and reduced in grade; and he was diagnosed as a perpetrator \nof spouse abuse, as well as a narcissistic personality disorder. In 2012, Applicant\u2019s ex-\nwife accused him of sexually abusing their daughter. \nIn 2017, at the direction of the DOD CAF, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed \nclinical psychologist. She determined that Applicant has a documented history of \nnarcissistic personality disorder, but also shows some of the atypical thinking such as \nunusual beliefs, and paranoia, odd speech, and social skill deficits such as a lack of close \nfriends, and social awkwardness commonly seen in an individual with schizotypal \npersonality disorder. She added: \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \nthe diagnosis in this case would render the patient in need of consistent \ntreatment (until symptoms remit, which is uncommon with diagnosis of this \nnature), but this has clearly not occurred at this point. My prognosis is poor, \ngiven the ingrained nature of his issues and poor likelihood for treatment \ncompliance. His psychological symptoms could certainly impede his \njudgment. . . Based upon his legal history, volatile mood and behaviors, and \nhis history of interpersonal conflicts, it appears that [Applicant] is likely to \nhave impaired reliability. \n \nBased solely on the facts briefly referred to above, AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a), 28(b), and 28(c) \nhave been established. AG \u00b6 28(d) has not been established because, while there may \nbe evidence of a diagnosed psychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness, there is little, if any, evidence to reflect any failure \nto follow a prescribed treatment plan related to the diagnosed condition(s) other than \nApplicant\u2019s decision not to attend some recommended family counseling sessions over a \ndecade ago. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from psychological conditions under AG \u00b6 29:  \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n \n \nThe complete record reflects that before Applicant and his first wife went through \nmarital discord, and for a period thereafter, he had a stellar military record; he was highly \nthought of by his Command and his units; his superiors and coworkers praised his duty \nperformance, military bearing, professionalism, community-service activities; he received \nrecognition for his performance; and he had an excellent reputation for honesty, integrity, \nand trustworthiness. Character references saw no evidence of any suicidal or homicidal \nideations, and never saw Applicant lose his temper or act irrationally. Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \nreputation and background were summarily cast aside when allegations of misconduct \narose. \n \n \nDivorce and child custody disputes have been routinely known to become ugly and \nhostile, and the situation reported in this instance is not shocking or unusual, for it merely \nsuggests a planned road map to success by one litigant against the other. One shocking \nor unusual feature in this case is the robotic manner in which there does not seem to be \nany analysis or investigation by the police or Command authorities to determine the truth \nof the allegations, explore the possible motivations for the allegations, or consider \nApplicant\u2019s repeated denials regarding those allegations, especially when he had a \nsterling reputation for honesty, integrity, and trustworthiness. No one in authority ever \nexamined Applicant\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s allegations of an assault by an instructor while on a \nbusiness trip; the alleged incident in the kitchen when she claimed she was cornered by \na tenant; or her allegations of assault on their daughter in 2012. Perhaps they could have \nconnected the dots between those allegations and the ones against Applicant.  \n \n \nAs noted above, the only documented evidence of one of those allegations \nappears in the Military Protective Order which cites as the sole basis for the issuance of \nthe order that Applicant\u2019s wife \u201cis concerned for her safety and [Applicant has] shown \nbehavior that could be interpreted as threatening.\u201d The exact statement was not recorded; \nthere is no evidence that it was under oath; there is no evidence of an investigation into \nthe truth of the allegations; it is unclear what the specific concerns of the wife were; and \nit is also unclear who made the interpretation that what was reportedly said was \nthreatening. Despite unit reservations regarding the allegations, and Applicant\u2019s repeated \ndenials, the initial steps to destroying Applicant\u2019s military career had begun. The local \nBaker Act \u2013 something now commonly referred to as the Red Flag Law \u2013 was applied, \nwithout due process, forcing Applicant to turn in his weapons, based solely on his wife\u2019s \nallegations; he was disciplined and reduced in grade for reportedly violating the no-\ncontact orders, based on additional allegations by his wife; he was ordered to undergo a \ncommand directed mental health evaluation; and he was required to attend Family \nAdvocacy Program and LSSC sessions. \n \n \nFar more disturbing than the robotic manner in which certain actions were taken \nby the police and Command authorities, were the somewhat superficial and unexplained \nactions taken by the mental health providers within the military system, most of which \ncannot be considered mental health evaluations under DODI 6490.1, or DODI 6490.4. \nApplicant initially went through a number of interview sessions, generally consisting of \nbetween 35 and 50 minutes each, after which he was prescribed medications for \ndepression, anxiety, panic disorder, and insomnia.  \n \n \nOn November 29, 2006, and December 1, 2006, after being seen for merely 45 \nminutes, with no evidence of any psychological testing administered to Applicant, it was \ndetermined that he was \u201cat significant risk of potential suicidal and/or homicidal action.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s denials were disregarded because of \u201cincongruent corroborating information,\u201d \nnot otherwise identified or described. Additionally, the life skills element chief concluded \nthat Applicant \u201creflected delusions of persecution but no hallucinations.\u201d The specifics of \nthose delusions were not described or identified. It is interesting that, despite significant \n\n \n15 \n                                      \n \nrisk of potential suicidal and/or homicidal action, Applicant was not involuntarily \nhospitalized. Perhaps it was because those conditions were not as reported. \n \n \nOn February 26, 2007, again without being administered any psychological tests, \nbased on the \u201capparent discrepancy in reports and history,\u201d not otherwise identified or \ndescribed, he was found to be at moderate risk to self and/or others, and given a \ndiagnosis of physical abuse of adult. There is no documented basis for this diagnosis, \nand the factual sources leading to it are unknown. On March 23, 2007, the family \nadvocacy officer boot-strapped the earlier information to the file and altered the V61.12 \ndiagnosis to perpetrator of spouse abuse, without any explanation, and added an entirely \nnew diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder, claiming it meets criteria 1 (grandiose \nsense of self-importance), 2 (preoccupied with fantasies), 5 (sense of entitlement), 7 \n(lacks empathy), and 9 (shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes). The bases for \nthose findings were not described, and they appear to be at odds with descriptions of \nApplicant by his superiors and coworkers \u2013 information that no healthcare provider or \nCommand leadership ever sought to provide. Despite the comments made, Applicant was \nnot deemed to be suicidal or homicidal, and the risk remained moderate. He was \nscheduled to return in two weeks for a risk assessment. \n \n \nThere is a Mental Health Record made by the licensed clinical psychologist that \nthe record was being closed without Applicant again being seen. That record contains the \nfollowing statement: \u201cthe impact of the treatment of military was administratively \ndischarged from active duty service based on the results of the [Command Directed \nEvaluation] and diagnosis of personality disorder.\u201d That characterization is patently false, \nand without any basis in fact, and the source of the comment is not known. Nevertheless, \nit was subsequently included in a subsequent DOD CAF-directed mental health \nevaluation over a decade later, as well as an allegation in the SOR. \n \nAs noted above, in 2017, at the direction of the DOD CAF, Applicant was evaluated \nby a licensed clinical psychologist. It is not known whether she used the DSM-IV-TR or \nthe DSM-5 in making her evaluation. She determined that Applicant has a documented \nhistory of narcissistic personality disorder, but also shows some of the atypical thinking \nsuch as unusual beliefs, and paranoia, odd speech, and social skill deficits such as a lack \nof close friends, and social awkwardness commonly seen in an individual with schizotypal \npersonality disorder. She failed to describe the basis for her conclusions of atypical \nthinking, unusual beliefs, paranoia, odd speech, social skills deficits, lack of close friends, \nand social awkwardness, especially in light of his many supporters and friends. In the \nabsence of such information, her conclusions are considered baseless. Far more \ntroubling is her reliance on the \u201chistorical\u201d information \u2013 Applicant\u2019s negative legal history, \nvolatile mood and behaviors, and his history of interpersonal conflicts \u2013 furnished to her \nby the DOD CAF without further investigation.  \n \nSince the only negative information in evidence appears to be the complaints of \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife and her boyfriend during the period 2004 through 2008, and again in \n2012, it is unclear what that negative legal history (except for unverified allegations \nappearing in a past evaluation that he had bashed someone\u2019s head in at the age of 19, \nand the accusation by his ex-wife that he had sexually abused his daughter in 2012), \n\n \n16 \n                                      \n \nvolatile mood and behaviors, and his history of interpersonal conflicts, consists of. The \nclinician failed to consider any favorable information about Applicant, including his over-\na-decade without problems; the continuing actions by his ex-wife in making false \nallegations against him; the guardian ad litem\u2019s changed position regarding his \nrelationship with his daughter; his supportive wife, colleagues, and friends; and \nApplicant\u2019s repeated denials of suicidal or homicidal ideations. Instead, she merely \nbootstrapped her information to that of previous \u201cevaluations\u201d that also contained \nunverified or unsourced information. She did not explain why there is a poor likelihood for \ntreatment compliance, and did not explain why it is likely that Applicant will have impaired \nreliability. According to the DSM-IV-TR, \u201cmany highly successful individuals display \npersonality traits that might be considered narcissistic. Only when these traits are \ninflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment or \nsubjective distress do they constitute Narcissistic Personality Disorder.\u201d (DSM-IV-TR, at \n717) This clinician failed to justify her diagnosis and prognosis under either DSM-IV-TR \nor DSM-5. \n \nMeaningful due process and fundamental fairness require that individuals be \npresented with all the evidence used to support allegations against them. Merely \nfurnishing summaries of activities, impressions of third parties, characterizations of \ninformation without the documents supporting those characterizations, or conclusions \nbased on unspecified and unverified facts, is not sufficient, especially when the alleged \nevents occurred over a decade ago. Documents considered mental health evaluations, \nespecially those that cannot be considered as such by DODI 6490.1 and DODI 6490.4, \nare unacceptable.  \n \nThe existence of a psychological condition does not preclude the granting of a \nsecurity clearance. Some conditions are unrelated to security issues and others can be \nmitigated by ongoing treatment or other factors. Unfortunately, mental health evaluations \nthat contain unverified or inaccurate information, or only one side of the story, are far \nmore damaging because of the high level of deference generally given to clinicians and \ntheir opinions. In this instance, because of the lack of confidence in the quality, \ncompleteness, and accuracy of the most recent \u201cpsychological evaluation,\u201d I have given \nit less weight than I might have if: more thorough psychological tests had been \nadministered and scored; the errors in the report had been corrected; Applicant\u2019s denials \nhad been even minimally explored; the situation involving the continuing custody struggle \nhad been considered; and unidentified sources had been provided. Accordingly, while AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 29(a), 29(b), 29(c), and 29(d) do not apply, AG \u00b6 29(e) applies because I have \ndetermined that the duly qualified mental health professional\u2019s 2017 opinion, diagnosis, \nand prognosis are too riddled with errors and omissions to be of much value.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the appellant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n\n \n17 \n                                      \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966)) \n  \n \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. In 2006, \nApplicant\u2019s then-wife and her boyfriend made allegations to the police and the Command \nthat Applicant had threatened to kill them and Applicant\u2019s daughter, as well as kill himself. \nNo-contact orders were issued to Applicant by the Command; he was directed to undergo \na mental health evaluation; it was determined that Applicant was at significant risk of \npotential suicidal and/or homicidal action; it was later determined that he was a moderate \nrisk to self and/or others; he was reported to be in violation of the no-contact orders; he \nwas disciplined and reduced in grade; and he was diagnosed as a perpetrator of spouse \nabuse, as well as a narcissistic personality disorder. In 2012, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife accused \nhim of sexually abusing their daughter. A 2017 psychological evaluation, to which I have \ngiven minimum weight because of issues discussed above, described concerns regarding \nApplicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. \n \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nserving as a maintenance control lead with his current employer since February 2010. He \nis a 1996 high school graduate, with some college credits, but no degree. Applicant \nenlisted in the U.S. Air Force in October 2001, and he served on active duty until August \n2007, when he was honorably discharged. Before the marital and child custody issues \narose, Applicant had a stellar military record; he was highly thought of by his Command \nand his units; his superiors and coworkers praised his duty performance, military bearing, \nprofessionalism, and community-service activities; he received recognition for his \nperformance; and he had an excellent reputation for honesty, integrity, and \ntrustworthiness. He was granted a top secret clearance in 2003. His record with his \ncurrent employer is also one of stellar performance. Character references, including some \ninitially from his military service years as well as some with continuing long-term \nrelationships, have never seen any evidence of suicidal or homicidal ideations, and have \nnever seen Applicant lose his temper or act irrationally.  \n \n \nThe sole sources for the problems initially facing Applicant were his then-wife and \nher boyfriend, shortly before a divorce and custody battle erupted well over a decade ago. \n\n \n18 \n                                      \n \nThe environment in which the entire situation took place is extraordinarily significant: an \nugly divorce and continuing child custody battle. They were the ones alleging that \nApplicant made certain statements and threats, and took certain actions against them as \nwell as Applicant\u2019s daughter, that sparked the actions taken by the civil and military \nauthorities. They were the ones who essentially destroyed Applicant\u2019s military career, \nlimited his relationship with his daughter, and subsequently tried destroying his current \ncareer. Despite her history of false allegations against three individuals, including \nApplicant, the authorities accepted her allegations against Applicant, and they flatly \ndenied his side of the story. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife made a false allegation against one \ncharacter reference, claiming that he had cornered her in the kitchen of her residence, \nand she made another allegation, seemingly not otherwise followed-up upon regarding \nan instructor who reportedly assaulted her. At least one character witness also noted that \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s now-husband (the former boyfriend) kept threatening Applicant. \n \n \nMy comments regarding the quality, thoroughness, and accuracy of the \npsychological or mental health evaluations made, as well as the absence of significant \ndocumentation and other source material in evidence, remain as previously stated.  \nApplicant\u2019s past psychological conditions, to the extent that there were some, under the \ncircumstances no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his psychological conditions. \nSee SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.:  \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se   \n \n \n08/06/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \n \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to revoke his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. He was terminated from employment in February 2015 \ndue to intentional time mischarging. He explained that it was his common practice to \nwork more hours than the 40 hours he charged. His workplace misconduct is mitigated \nas an isolated incident that is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86 format) on April 30, 2015. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly \nknown as a security clearance application. Thereafter, on March 27, 2018, after \nreviewing the application and the information gathered during a background \ninvestigation, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort \nMeade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was \nunable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It \n\n \n2 \n \ndetailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guideline known as \nGuideline E for personal conduct. The SOR alleged the following two matters: (1) \nApplicant was terminated from his employment in about February 2015 due to \nintentional time mischarging; and (2) he falsified his April 2015 security clearance \napplication by omitting the February 2015 termination in response to a question about \nhis employment history.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 11, 2018. He admitted the SOR allegations \nwith explanations in which he denied intentionally lying on his security clearance \napplication. He requested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \nThereafter, Department Counsel made a timely request for a hearing. (Tr. 18-21; \nAppellate Exhibit I)   \n \nThe case was assigned to me on July 25, 2018. The hearing was conducted as \nscheduled on September 20, 2018. Department Counsel offered documentary exhibits, \nwhich were admitted without objections as Exhibits 1, 2, and 3, but Exhibit 4 was not \nadmitted. Applicant offered three letters of recommendation, which were admitted as \nExhibits A, B, and C. Other than Applicant, no witnesses were called.  \n \nExhibit 4 is a three-page letter, dated February 19, 2015, from Applicant\u2019s former \nemployer. (Tr. 49-56) The writer is identified as an assistant general counsel of the \ncompany. The letter is a summarized account of the investigative steps and findings \nthat led to Applicant\u2019s termination in February 2015. The letter was offered after \nDepartment Counsel completed their case-in-chief and during cross-examination of \nApplicant. The letter was not obtained during the course of Applicant\u2019s background \ninvestigation; it was obtained by Department Counsel about a week before the hearing; \nit was not provided to Applicant in advance of the hearing; and he saw the document for \nthe first time during the hearing. (Tr. 50-52)  \n \nApplicant objected, and Exhibit 4 was not admitted due to lack of authentication \nas required under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of Enclosure 3 to the Directive. (Tr. 52-56) Upon further \nreview of the exhibit, it is difficult to determine if the assistant general counsel had first-\nhand knowledge of the information he was relating in the document or if he was relying \non information provided by others in the company. In addition, admission of Exhibit 4, \nwithout an authenticating witness, would have deprived Applicant of the opportunity to \ncross-examine the person or persons who produced Exhibit 4 on information adverse to \nApplicant, contrary to Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 3(6) and \u00b6 4.3.3 of the Directive.  \n \nIn closing argument, Department Counsel stated they found Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony and explanation sufficiently credible and they were no longer concerned \nabout the falsification allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Tr. 76)  Accordingly, given Department \nCounsel\u2019s position, the falsification allegation is decided for Applicant, and it will not be \naddressed further herein. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on September 26, \n2018.    \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n  Findings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance \npreviously granted to him by the Defense Department. He is employed by a company \nworking in the defense industry as a satellite communications engineer. He has had his \ncurrent job since March 2018. His current employment contract is for about $170,000 \nannually. His formal education consists of a high school diploma and some college. His \nemployment history includes honorable service in the U.S. Army during 1990-1988. He \nserved for the first three years as a tanker (the armor branch), and the last five years in \nsatellite communications. He was granted a security clearance for the first time during \nhis military service. He has worked for a number of companies in the defense industry \nsince 1998. He has spent about 18 years working overseas in several countries in the \nMiddle East, including eight years in Afghanistan and four years in Iraq. (Tr. 69-71)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s February 2015 termination arises from the timeframe of December \n2014-January 2015, when he was working at a temporary duty location in the \ncontinental United States. He was employed with this company for less than a year, \nbeginning in August 2014 and ending with his termination in February 2015. Upon his \ntermination, the former employer\u2019s security office submitted an adverse information \nreport, which stated that an investigation conducted by the company\u2019s internal audit \noffice determined that Applicant had engaged in intentional time mischarging, and that \nApplicant was terminated as a result on February 6, 2015. (Exhibit 2) No further details \nof the incident were provided in the report.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s termination was reviewed during the course of his most recent \nbackground investigation. According to a report of investigation (ROI), Applicant was \ninterviewed in April 2016 and provided information about his previous termination. \n(Exhibit 3) The ROI states, among other things, that Applicant \u201cvolunteered that he was \nterminated from employment with [former employer] due to filling out his time card \nincorrectly by not claiming all hours that [he] worked. Applicant was physically working \n65-70 hours a week and was only claiming 40 hours per week on his time card.\u201d In other \nwords, Applicant was undercharging as opposed to overcharging his hours.   \n \nApplicant provided the same explanation during the hearing. (Tr. 28-31) He \nstated that he was accustomed to a workplace culture that expected an employee to put \nin extra hours. But he also acknowledged his practice was \u2018kind of cheating\u201d because it \ngave an inaccurate account of his time. (Tr. 29) He unequivocally denied overcharging \nby claiming more hours than actually worked. (Tr. 44, 47, and 60-61) He stated that \nduring the termination or exit interview his former employer told him the basis for \ntermination was undercharging hours, and they made the point it was just as bad or \nwrongful as overcharging hours. (Tr. 44)  \n \nApplicant presented three highly favorable letters of recommendation. A former \ndirect supervisor wrote that Applicant always displayed outstanding professionalism, \ngreat integrity, and teamwork. (Exhibit A) The former supervisor also wrote that \nApplicant had no incidents or violations in handling classified information over a three-\nyear period while working overseas, nor did Applicant have any timecard issues. \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant\u2019s current officer-in-charge, a chief warrant officer four in the U.S. Army, \ndescribed Applicant\u2019s duty performance as superb. (Exhibit B) His current project \nmanager and direct supervisor described Applicant as an expert in the field of satellite \ntechnologies and telecommunications. (Exhibit C) The supervisor also praised \nApplicant\u2019s work ethic and diligence in his timesheet recording and communication of \nwork performed. The supervisor concluded his letter by writing that Applicant is one of \nhis best employees. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E.3.1.15. \n\n \n5 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, personal conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about a person\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. The concern is stated fully in AG \u00b6 15. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all the available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (1) \nuntrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or government protected information; (2) any \ndisruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; (3) a pattern of \ndishonesty or rule violations; and (4) evidence of significant misuse of \ngovernment or other employer\u2019s time or resources; and   \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not case doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \n \nAs set forth in the findings of fact, Applicant was fired from his job in February \n2015 due to intentional time mischarging. He does not dispute this fact. He certainly \nused questionable judgment in mischarging his time during December 2014-January \n2015 timeframe. His mischarging was serious enough to justify termination. The \nmischarging also qualifies as workplace misconduct sufficient to raise a concern under \nthe personal conduct guideline. \n \n \nIn mitigation, Applicant explained that the incident stemmed from his practice of \nworking more hours than the 40 hours he charged on the timesheet. He has worked for \ntwo employers since the 2015 termination, and he has been diligent in timesheet \nrecording and communication of work performed. (Exhibits A and C) Moving forward to \nSeptember 2018 when the evidentiary record closed, the incident is now more than \nthree years old, and there is no evidence of recurrence of similar conduct since the \nFebruary 2015 termination. The passage of time without recurrence weighs in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. On balance, I am persuaded that Applicant\u2019s workplace misconduct is \nmitigated as an isolated incident that occurred during a longtime career working in the \n\n \n6 \n \ndefense industry, it is unlikely to recur, and it does not cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n    \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \nversa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline B, foreign influence, but \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 20, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations and Guideline B, foreign influence. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 21, 2018, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December 11, 2018. The Defense \n02/06/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on December 11, \n2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 17, 2019. The Government \noffered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. Applicant offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through \nK. There were no objections to any exhibits, and they were admitted into evidence.1 \nDOHA received the hearing transcript on January 28, 2019.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice and Procedural Matters \n \n \nDepartment Counsel withdrew SOR \u00b6 1.c. Department Counsel submitted HE II, a \nwritten request that I take administrative notice of certain facts about the Philippines. \nApplicant did not object, and I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in \nthe request that are supported by source documents from official U.S. Government \npublications.2  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. He denied the allegation \nin SOR \u00b6 2.a. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 51 years old. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 1988. He was \nmarried and divorced twice from 1997 to 2003. There were no children from the \nmarriages. He remarried in 2012 and has children, ages five years old and 21 months. \nHe has worked for the same federal contractor since 1988.3 \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2007 through \n2016 and owed past-due federal income taxes.4  \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in February 2015. He \ndisclosed that he failed to timely file his 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 federal income \ntax returns. He stated: \u201cI am currently working to file federal taxes for 2007.\u201d5 He repeated \nthis statement for each of the tax years he disclosed and stated he estimated owing $500 \nfor each year. He did not disclose he failed to timely file federal income tax returns for \n                                                          \n1 Hearing Exhibit I (HE) is a demonstrative exhibit provided by Government Counsel. \n \n2 Source documents are attached to Hearing Exhibit II. \n \n3 Tr. 21-24; GE 1. \n \n4 Tr. 25; GE 1, 2, 3; AE A through K. \n \n5 GE 1. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n2012, 2013 and 2014. He testified he could not recall why he failed to disclose the other \ntax years. At that time his 2015 federal income tax return was not yet due.6  \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in November 2015. He \ndisclosed that in September 2015 he filed his 2007 through 2011 federal income tax \nreturns. He explained that these tax returns were not timely filed because he was lazy \nand did not realize he owed money. He was unaware at that time of the total amount he \nowed, but stated that he would possibly set up a payment plan. He initially hired a \nprofessional tax consultant firm to help him, but it went bankrupt.7  \n \nApplicant testified that he mailed his 2007, 2008, and 2009 federal tax returns in \n2015 and he never heard back from the IRS and the returns were not processed. He said \nhe called the IRS frequently to find out the returns\u2019 status. 8 \n \n \nApplicant completed government interrogatories.9 In response to inquiries, he \nexplained that he failed to file his 2007 through 2011 federal income tax returns. He said \nhe did not realize at the time that he owed taxes. He stated: \u201cThere is not a real reason \nfor not filing other then I had been burning myself in my work.\u201d10 He stated he had met \nwith the IRS in December 2016 about negotiating a payment plan or settlement. There \nwas an error in his 2007 return so he was told it needed to be corrected and resubmitted. \nHe explained his plan was to hire a tax attorney to complete his taxes, resubmit his 2007 \nreturn and negotiate a settlement. He provided the first page of his 2008, 2009 and 2010 \nIRS 1040 forms that only included his income and no other information. They were \nstamped by the IRS on December 13, 2016.11 \n \n \nApplicant completed additional government interrogatories in April 2018. He \nexplained he submitted tax documents to the IRS three weeks prior to his government \ninterview, but the IRS had not received his submission. He resubmitted tax documents in \nperson at an IRS office. He said all of his tax documents were accepted except for tax \nyear 2007 because it was missing a document. He resubmitted it, and he said his 2007 \ntax return was being processed to determine his tax liability. Applicant provided the first \n                                                          \n6 Tr. 28-30; GE 1. I have not considered any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR for \ndisqualifying purposes. I may consider such information when making a credibility determination, in the \napplication of mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis.  \n \n7 GE 3. \n \n8 Tr. 32. \n \n9 Applicant dated his response to the Government\u2019s August 2016 interrogatories as October 11, 2016. \nHowever, in his narrative response he provided dates he made contact with the IRS as December 2016, \nwhich would have occurred after the date he signed his interrogatories.  \n \n10 GE 2. \n \n11 Tr. 34-35; GE 2. \n\n \n4 \n \n \npage of his 2007 IRS 1040 that was stamped on January 24, 2016. The second page \nshows that it was prepared on January 19, 2018, by a tax preparer.12  \n \n \nIRS transcripts confirmed that Applicant submitted a 2007 IRS 1040 form in \nJanuary 2016, and it was filed in January 2018. Substitute tax returns were prepared by \nthe IRS for tax year 2008 in May 2010 and for tax year 2009 in August 2011. Applicant \nsubmitted his federal income tax returns to the IRS for tax year 2010 in December 2016; \ntax years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 were all filed in January 2018. \nApplicant\u2019s annual income for tax years 2008 to 2016 ranged from $98,000 to $130,000. \nHe was not married in 2007 through 2011.13  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he was dedicated to his work and did not practice due \ndiligence in timely completing his federal income tax returns. He said he had been working \nwith a professional tax consultant firm in 2012, but it went bankrupt. He said after that he \nwas missing documents. He understood he had a duty to file his tax returns. He kept \ngetting busy and delayed filing his tax returns. He said he was unable to retrieve from the \nIRS tax transcripts for 2007 and 2008, because they were too old. He said the reason he \nfailed to timely file his 2011 through 2016 federal tax returns was because he was trying \nto get a tax number for his wife. He was told by the IRS that he was due refunds for certain \ntax years, and he should wait for all of the delinquent years to be processed. Applicant \ntestified that refunds he was entitled to for tax years 2012 through 2016, were applied to \nthe federal income taxes he owed for tax years 2006, 2007, and 2008. In May 2018, he \nwithdrew money from his pension plan, paid the penalty, and paid the federal income \ntaxes he owed for tax years 2009, 2010 and 2011. Applicant provided an IRS document \nthat shows he has a zero balance as of January 2019.14 \n \n \nApplicant was asked if he had timely filed his 2017 federal income tax return, which \nwas due on April 15, 2018. He did not. He stated he filed it about three weeks before his \nhearing. He did not file an extension. He did not have an explanation for his failure to \ntimely file his 2017 federal income tax return. He stated \u201cIt was a credit, I didn\u2019t owe\u201d. He \ntestified that he promised he would file his tax returns on time in the future.15  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law was born in the Philippines. She became a permanent \nresident of the United States in September 2015. She was sponsored by Applicant\u2019s \nwife\u2019s sister and her husband, who are U.S. citizens. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law has \nreturned to the Philippines for several months since acquiring her permanent resident \nstatus, but has not returned there since 2017. She works as a child care provider and is \n                                                          \n12 GE 3. \n \n13 Tr. 36-38; AE D through K. \n \n14 Tr. 25, 39-48; AE C.  \n \n15 Tr. 48-51. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nself-sufficient. Applicant and his wife do not provide her financial support. Applicant\u2019s \nmother-in-law has family that lives in the Philippines.16 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n                                                          \n16 Tr. 52-78; AE A, B. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2007 through \n2016. He owed a substantial tax debt that was past due. There is sufficient evidence to \nsupport the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for ten years. He owed a \nsignificant tax debt. He completed an SCA in February 2015 and disclosed some of the \ntax years he failed to file returns, but not all of them. After being put on notice about that \nhis failure to timely file tax returns was a security concern, he failed to timely file his 2016 \nand 2017 federal income tax return. Applicant owed federal income taxes for numerous \ntax years that were not paid until May 2018. There is insufficient evidence to conclude \nthat his behavior is unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s repeated failure to pay his federal taxes \nand file his federal income tax returns casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant attributed his failure to timely file his federal income tax returns to being \nlazy and working hard. He did not think he owed taxes. He also attributed his failure to \ntimely file during the later years to not having a tax number for his wife. These factors did \nnot impact Applicant\u2019s ability to comply with tax laws and obligations. These factors were \nnot beyond Applicant\u2019s control. Even if he could not obtain a tax number for his wife for \none year, it does not explain why this was not corrected in subsequent years. It also did \nnot prevent him from filing his tax returns. Applicant\u2019s eventual resolution of his delinquent \ntax filings and payment of his overdue taxes years after they were due does not show he \nacted responsibly. Even after he was put on notice about the security concerns, he did \nnot act responsibly. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant has filed his delinquent federal income tax returns and paid his past-due \nfederal taxes. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(g) apply. I cannot find that Applicant\u2019s eventual \npayment of his federal income taxes years after they were due and only after his security \nclearance became an issue constitutes a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) \ndoes not apply. \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresulted in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts \nand interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or \ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as \nwhether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive \ninformation or is it associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and the following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation. \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d required \nto raise this disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes \na risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under a \nforeign government or owning property in a foreign country. The totality of Applicant\u2019s \nfamily ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen of the Philippines and has been permanent \nresident of the United States since 2015. She was sponsored by Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law \nand brother-in-law. His mother-in-law is employed in the United States and is self-\nsufficient. I do not find there is a heightened risk or a potential for foreign influence. I find \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) do not apply. I find in Applicant\u2019s favor under the Guideline B security \nconcerns.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 51 years old. His mother-in-law is a citizen of the Philippines and a \npermanent resident of the United States since 2015. She lives in the U.S., is employed, \nand is self-sufficient. I did not find any disqualifying conditions applied and find in \nApplicant\u2019s favor under Guideline B, foreign influence.  \n \nApplicant has been employed by the same federal contractor since 1986. He failed \nto timely file his 2007 through 2016 federal income tax returns. Even after he was aware \nof the seriousness of his conduct in 2015, he failed to timely file his federal income tax \nreturns for 2016 and again in 2017. The fact that years later he finally completed his legal \nobligations does not show he exercises good judgment and is reliable. The DOHA Appeal \nBoard has held that:  \n \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 17 \n \n                                                          \n17 ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June 29, 2016). \n\n \n10 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of non-compliance with a fundamental legal obligation to timely \nfile and pay his federal income taxes raises serious security concerns. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.c:  \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Petcher, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant has made no progress toward resolving a home-equity credit line that was \ncharged off for $37,193 in February 2015 or on a line of credit that was charged off for \n$4,482 in October 2014. As of May 2018, he had made some payments toward a collection \ndebt, but more progress is needed in addressing his delinquencies. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 9, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n09/28/2018\n\n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 29, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn April 18, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. On April 24, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for May 18, 2018. With the agreement \nof the parties, I changed the start time of the hearing and issued an Amended Notice of \nHearing on May 10, 2018. \n \nAt the hearing, four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) were admitted. A March 7, 2018 \nletter forwarding the proposed GEs to Applicant and a list of the GEs were marked as \nhearing exhibits (HEs I-II) for the record but not admitted in evidence. Applicant testified at \nthe hearing, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received on June 6, 2018. \n \nI held the record open for one month for evidentiary documents from Applicant. On \nMay 25, 2018, Applicant submitted AEs A-F, which were accepted into the record without \nany objection from the Government but with some concern over the weight to be afforded \nextracts of credit reports because they do not fully reflect Applicant\u2019s financial status. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations and Answer \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of January 9, 2018, Applicant owed \ncharged-off debts of $37, 193 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $4,482 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); a $786 collection debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c); a $262 wireless telephone debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and three medical \ncollection debts totaling $419 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). When Applicant answered the SOR allegations, \nhe admitted the debts.1 He indicated that he was currently enrolled in repayment plans for \nthe collection debts. Concerning the charged-off debts held by a bank, he explained that he \nand his spouse recalled obtaining a ten-year home-equity loan with a corresponding line of \ncredit (SOR \u00b6 1.a) but the bank now holding the debt has indicated that the account \u201chad \nturned into a 30 year loan,\u201d which became six months in arrears pending his fraud claim. \nThe bank demanded that he pay the arrearage in full or obtain a restructuring of the loan. \nAfter his application for a loan modification was denied, the bank indicated it would \nproceed with foreclosure to close the account. Advised by a credit counseling service that a \nsecond mortgage would not cause him to lose his home, Applicant reapplied for a \nmodification that was denied. He denied receiving any correspondence about the debt \nsince April 2015 but indicated that he would pay off the debt on the sale of his home in \nwhich he has equity exceeding $120,000. (Answer.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 60 years old and a high school graduate. He has worked for his current \nemployer, a defense contractor, since March 2008. He has been at his present duty \n                                                 \n1 Applicant addressed each of the debts in his answer, but his paragraph designations do not match those of \nthe SOR of record. \n\n3 \n \nlocation since September 2011 and provides program management support. He previously \nworked for another defense contractor from 1983 to February 2008 and has held a \nclearance since September 1983. He was granted sensitive compartmented information \n(SCI) eligibility in 2003. (GEs 1, 2; Tr. 29-30.) He currently holds a secret clearance. (Tr. \n36.) \n \nApplicant and his spouse married in January 1985. They have one child, a son now \nage 33. Applicant has a 35-year-old daughter from a previous relationship while his spouse \nhas a 39-year-old daughter from her previous marriage. (GE 1; Tr. 34.) Applicant\u2019s spouse \nworked during their marriage until 2002, when Applicant became legal guardian to his \ngrandson, then an infant. (Tr. 34-35.) Applicant\u2019s spouse manages the finances in their \nhousehold. (Tr. 58.) \n \nIn September 2004, Applicant purchased a new home for his family. (GEs 1-2.) He \nobtained a 30-year mortgage for $219,900, to be repaid at $1,831 per month. Within a year \nor so, Applicant opened a secured line of credit (SOR \u00b6 1.a) to finish the basement.2 (GEs \n3-4; Tr. 22, 50.) Over the course of the next five years, he borrowed approximately \n$32,000. (Tr. 51, 68.) \n \nApplicant and his spouse\u2019s son was wounded while serving in Iraq in September \n2007. He was medically evacuated to a hospital in Europe before returning to his home in \nanother state. In February 2008, Applicant and his spouse relocated to their son\u2019s area to \nhelp him with his recovery. In March 2008, Applicant began working as a contractor for his \npresent employer on a U.S. military base at $83,000 a year, about $2,000 less than his \nprevious salary. His household expenses increased significantly. He and his spouse rented \na house at $1,200 a month in their new area while continuing to pay the mortgage on their \nprevious residence, which was occupied by Applicant\u2019s daughter and her two children. \nApplicant\u2019s daughter, who was a waitress, contributed \u201croughly $800\u201d a month, about half \nof the monthly mortgage payment on the home. (Tr. 20-21, 30-32.) Applicant\u2019s spouse \nmade the mortgage payments on time through July 2009. Applicant\u2019s loan was past due 30 \ndays when it was transferred shortly thereafter to a new loan servicer. The new loan \nservicer failed to withdraw the mortgage payment from their bank account, and their loan \nwas placed into a government program, which increased the balance of the loan to \n$231,520. (GEs 3-4; Tr. 22.) \n \nIn May 2011, Applicant\u2019s daughter vacated Applicant\u2019s house, and Applicant\u2019s \nspouse and grandson returned home in June 2011. (Tr. 32-33.) As of August 2011, \nApplicant and his spouse had an open line of credit for $5,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) as overdraft \nprotection for the home-equity line of credit in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Monthly payments on the \naccount were $143. (GE 3.) After a job opportunity at the same salary surfaced for his \nemployer in his current location, Applicant moved back home in September 2011. (Tr. 32-\n33.) \n \n                                                 \n2 Applicant testified that he obtained a home-equity line of credit in 2005 with a small community bank, and it \nwas later transferred to the bank identified in SOR \u00b6 1.a. (Tr. 50.) Available credit reports show an opening \ndate of August 2007 with the bank listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a. (GEs 3-4.) \n\n4 \n \nIn August 2013, Applicant\u2019s spouse was diagnosed with cancer and began incurring \nmedical bills that strained their finances. (Tr. 33-34.) While Applicant had health insurance, \nhe had a $9,000 deductible to cover any medical copayments. (Tr. 39-40.) Over the next \ntwo years, Applicant and his spouse paid $11,000 to $12,000 toward her medical \nexpenses. He also lost income because he was unable to travel during his spouse\u2019s \ntreatments. (Tr. 40.) \n \nAfter November 2013, Applicant and his spouse stopped paying on the home-equity \nloan in SOR \u00b6 1.a. When they were billed for two months of payments (approximately \n$886), Applicant contacted the bank holding the debt and was informed that the loan had \nbeen converted to a 30-year second mortgage and that he was in default. He had paid on \nthe secured line of credit for several years and disputed the terms claimed by the bank. \nOver the next five months, the balance continued to accrue because of nonpayment. \nApplicant assumed he was a victim of predatory lending. Applicant learned that the \nconversion to a 30-year loan was in the terms of his original contract. Not knowing how to \nproceed and unable to pay the full balance of the debt, Applicant contacted the bank. On \nits advice, he applied for a 30-year mortgage to address the delinquent secured line of \ncredit, only to be denied. When he indicated that he could not pay the full balance, he was \ntold that a lien would be placed against his home. In February 2015, the bank charged off \nthe account for $37,193 and placed a lien on his home. (GEs 3-4; Tr. 23, 52-56.) \n \nIn March 2014, Applicant and his spouse stopped paying on the line of credit \nobtained in July 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) that was held by the same bank as the secured home-\nequity loan. In October 2014, the bank charged off a balance of $4,482. (GEs 3-4.) \n \nApplicant missed one payment on his primary mortgage because of a lack of funds. \nHe then made regular payments on his mortgage, but his account was chronically 30 days \npast due in 2014 and 2015 because he could not afford to make a double payment. (GEs \n2-4.) \n \nIn July 2015, Applicant leased a 2015 model-year truck, taking on an $18,991 debt \nto be repaid at $486 per month. In December 2015, he obtained a $12,795 car loan for a \n2011 model-year small sport utility vehicle for his spouse. Monthly payments on the loan \nare $248. (GEs 3-4; Tr. 59, 65-66.) \n \nOn February 24, 2016, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Positions (SF 86). In response to financial record inquiries \nconcerning any delinquency involving routine accounts, Applicant indicated that he owed \n$35,000 in credit card and second mortgage debt because of medical bills. (GE 1.) \n \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on April 12, 2016, showed that, in addition to the \ncharged-off balances of $37,193 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $4,482 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) on the lines of \ncredit, medical debts of $150 from June 2014 (SOR \u00b61.e), $150 from March 2015 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.f), and $119 from April 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) were in collection. Applicant or his spouse was \nmaking payments on a closed credit card account with a $1,780 balance, on the auto lease \nwith a $15,096 balance and loan with a $12,590 balance, and on open credit card accounts \n\n5 \n \nwith balances of $5,250 and $142. (GE 3.) A more recent credit report of November 27, \n2017, revealed that a $786 consumer credit debt was placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.c) in \nNovember 2015. As of April 2017, a cellphone debt of $262 from September 2016 was in \ncollection (SOR \u00b6 1.d). A credit card opened in November 2003 with Applicant as an \nauthorized user was charged off for $1,827 in 2013 (not alleged). (GE 4.) \n \nIn May 2017, Applicant had a medical issue that required his hospitalization for a \nmonth. He was out of work until August 2017, and his short-term disability income was \n60% of his regular income. (Tr. 26-27.) Applicant incurred approximately $10,000 in out-of-\npocket medical expenses in addition to the income loss for being unable to travel for work. \n(Tr. 41.) \n \n \nOn August 16, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). He acknowledged that he could owe as much as \n$40,000 on the secured line of credit, which he actively disputed until 2015 on the basis \nthat it was a ten-year loan, not the 30-year loan claimed by the bank. He had not received \nany correspondence about the account since 2015 and had not paid anything toward the \ndebt. He expressed an intention to make payments on the account if he receives \ninformation on the account. Applicant volunteered that he missed two payments on a \nMasterCard account that was charged off for approximately $700 and could be in \ncollections. He did not know the current status of the account but would pay it if contacted \nby the creditor. When confronted with other adverse credit information on his record, \nApplicant indicated about the medical collection debt on his record that he could have \noverlooked some medical bills from his spouse\u2019s cancer treatments, but he did not recall \nany specifics. When asked about his late payments on his primary mortgage, Applicant \nrelated that after he missed one payment, he was always one month behind because he \ncould not make a double payment. However, he indicated that he brought the loan current \nin 2017. Applicant did not recognize the $1,827 delinquency on his credit record. As for the \n$4,482 charged-off credit line, Applicant explained that it was for overdraft protection of the \nsecured line of credit account, and that it was charged off. Applicant related that his current \nfinancial status was positive, and he did not anticipate any future financial issues. (GE 2.) \n \n \nAs of September 2017, Applicant was one month behind on his $1,711 monthly \npayment of his primary mortgage. (GE 4.) He fell behind last year because of his loss of \nincome, registration costs for both vehicles, and the expense of having to put new tires and \nbrakes on his truck. He has been consistently one month behind since then. (Tr. 60.)  A \ncredit card account with a current balance of $252 had been delinquent as recently as \nJune 2017. Applicant was making timely payments for his and his spouse\u2019s car loan \nbalances of $9,455 and $5,843. He was also making timely payments on his credit card \nwith a home improvement retailer, which had a balance of $4,339. (GE 4.) \n \n \nAs of May 2018, Applicant had made no payments on the charged-off line of credit \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) or its overdraft protection account (SOR \u00b6 1.b), which were closed with \nreported outstanding balances of $37,193 and $4,482. (AE C.) He testified that he intends \nto repay those debts when he sells his home and that he has no choice in that regard. (Tr. \n23-24, 56.) Applicant testified that he received a 1099 form from the bank in 2017, but he \n\n6 \n \n\u201ccould not trace it\u201d because the amount does not correspond to information that he has \nabout the account. (Tr. 57-58.)  He reported the amount as income on his tax return and \nincurred a federal tax underpayment of $1,100. He was expecting a state tax refund of \n$1,300 that he planned to use to satisfy his federal tax liability. (Tr. 61.) As for consumer \ncredit card accounts, Applicant stated that five collection entities are currently taking \nbetween $40 and $60 a month from his checking account.3  (Tr. 24, 44.) Applicant believed \nthat one of his debts (SOR \u00b6 1.c) was being actively collected at $37 a month. After he \nreceived the SOR, he contacted the creditor holding the debt and made a payment in late \nJanuary 2018, which reduced the balance to $742. (AE B; Tr. 43.) He did not realize until \nMay 2018 that he failed to authorize recurring payment. He corrected the issue to repay the \ndebt at $37 a month from May 2018 through December 2019. (AEs A, D.) Applicant \nbelieves that the medical accounts and the wireless phone debt are paid \u201cas noted by the \nabsence of these accounts in the collections section\u201d on his credit report. He testified that, \nin November 2017, he made repayment arrangements with an entity now collecting the \nwireless phone debt, and that he is repaying the debt at $60 a month from his account with \na credit union. (Tr. 46-47.) Information from Credit Karma indicates the wireless phone \ncollection account (SOR \u00b6 1.d) has been closed with an outstanding balance of $200 as of \nlate May 2018. (AE C.) There is no documentation confirming payments toward the \nmedical collection debts, although Applicant stated that he began making $40 monthly \npayments toward the debts after he received the SOR. (Tr. 48.) With regard to the timing of \nhis debt repayments, Applicant stated: \n \nI didn\u2019t have any more money available. I realized the importance of the \nimpact of some of these bills. I wasn\u2019t ignoring them. I was paying other bills. \nI didn\u2019t want anything else to get onto the credit report. I decided to pay \nthem. (Tr. 49.) \n \n \nApplicant testified to his belief that the $119 medical collection debt (SOR 1.g) has \nbeen paid (Tr. 49), although he provided no corroborating documentation. Since January \n2018, he and his spouse have less than $100 in discretionary income each month. (Tr. 58.) \nHe had $2,500 to $3,000 in his checking account as of mid-May 2018 because he had just \nbeen paid. (Tr. 62.) \n \n \nApplicant and his spouse have been raising his grandson (age 15 as of May 2018) \nsince infancy. Applicant has expenses for his grandson\u2019s driving school, competitive \narchery training, and high school activities, in addition to necessities such as food and \nclothing. Applicant\u2019s spouse is currently unemployed and has not worked since 2002. (Tr. \n25, 34.) She finished her cancer treatment in 2016. (Tr. 26.) Applicant\u2019s current salary is \n$93,000 a year. (Tr. 37.) Since 2014 or 2015, he has had retirement income of $1,300 a \nmonth from his previous job. He applied for the disbursement when his spouse was under \nmedical treatment. (Tr. 63.) He has accumulated $7,000 in a 401(k) with his current \nemployer. Applicant\u2019s spouse has $12,000 in a retirement account. (Tr. 64.) Before his own \nmedical problem in May 2017, he traveled for work and had per diem income that \naugmented his salary by $10,000 a year on average. Applicant expects to resume traveling \n                                                 \n3 Applicant had been repaying some debts not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 43-44.) \n\n7 \n \nfor work in the near future. (Tr. 37-39.) He described his financial situation as \u201cthe worst it\u2019s \nbeen in 30 years, but it\u2019s getting better.\u201d (Tr. 64-65.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n\n8 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant is not required to be debt free, but he is required to manage his finances \nin a way to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. Debts that have been charged off or \nplaced for collection raise financial considerations security concerns. Applicant became \ndelinquent on a secured line of credit account and an associated overdraft protection \naccount while his spouse was undergoing treatment for a serious illness diagnosed in \nAugust 2013. He had no success in restructuring the debt or obtaining a new loan to \naddress the delinquency, and balances of $37,193 and $4,482 were respectively charged \noff in February 2015 and October 2014. A $786 credit card delinquency was placed for \ncollection in November 2015 due to nonpayment since February 2014. A wireless \ntelephone debt of $262, and three medical debts totaling $419 were placed for collection. \nDisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d apply. \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the evidence of financial delinquency. One or \nmore of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply: \n\n9 \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. With the possible exception of the wireless services \ndebt, which had some activity on the account in September 2016, the debts became past \ndue three to four years ago. The delinquencies were not recently incurred. However, they \nhad not been resolved as of the issuance of the SOR in January 2018. The Appeal Board \nrecently affirmed that unresolved debts are a continuing course of conduct. See ISCR \nCase No. 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-08799 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2017)). \n \nApplicant has a credible case for some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). Between 2008 \nand 2011, Applicant and his spouse continued to pay the mortgage on their home while \nrenting separate housing near their son, who had been injured in Iraq. Applicant\u2019s \ndaughter, who moved into the home while they were away, could only afford half the \nmonthly mortgage obligation. Their monthly housing expense went from $1,600 to $2,000 \n(half the mortgage plus their rent of $1,200). Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s serious illness, \ndiagnosed in August 2013, was an unforeseen circumstance that further compromised the \nfamily\u2019s finances. Over the next two years, Applicant and his spouse paid $11,000 to \n$12,000 toward her medical expenses. Applicant lost income of approximately $10,000 on \naverage a year because he was unable to travel during his spouse\u2019s treatments. The \nsecured line of credit, the overdraft protection account, and the $150 medical debts \nbecame delinquent during that time.  More recently, Applicant had a medical problem in \nMay 2017 that led to a loss of 40% in income over the short term and additional medical \nexpenses. It continues to have an impact in that he has been unable to travel for work. \n\n10 \n \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside of his control, I have to consider whether Applicant acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with his financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-\n11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. \nMay 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether Applicant maintained \ncontact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts \ncurrent. Applicant has had retirement income of $1,300 per month for the past two years. It \nis difficult to find that Applicant acted fully responsibly toward his creditors when he did \nlittle, if anything, to address his delinquencies in 2016 and 2017. Applicant submits that he \nwas paying other debts, but the evidence also shows that he took on car payments totaling \n$734 per month in 2015 while collection debts went unpaid. Applicant did not recognize the \nmedical debts when confronted about them during his subject interview, but he knew that \nhe had at least one delinquent credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.c) that he believed was in \ncollections for $700. He ignored the debt until it was clear that it became an issue for his \nsecurity clearance eligibility. \n \nAGs \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) have minimal applicability. Applicant presented \ndocumentation showing that he has a repayment plan established for the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.c showing a payment of $37 on the same day as his security clearance hearing. He \nindicates that he also made a payment in late January 2018, and available credit reports \nshow some reduction in the balance from $786 in November 2017 to $742 in May 2018. \nApplicant submits that the medical and wireless phone debts in collection have been paid \nbecause they are not listed in the collections section on his May 2018 credit report. The \nAppeal Board stated in ISCR Case No. 16-01338, decided on July 13, 2018: \n \nAs we have previously stated, a credit report, in and of itself, may not be \nsufficient to meet an applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion as to mitigation, \ninsofar as it provides little evidence regarding the underlying circumstances \nof the debt. Moreover, the fact that a debt no longer appears on a credit \nreport does not establish a meaningful, independent evidence as to the \ndisposition of the debt. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. \nAug. 25, 2015). For example, debts may fall off credit reports merely due to \nthe passage of time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 6 (App. Bd. Oct \n26, 2006). \n \nApplicant presented only part of his May 2018 credit report. Even so, it shows that \nthe wireless phone account, now closed, has a $200 balance. The medical debts are not \nlisted. He testified that he made $40 monthly payments toward the $300 in medical \ncollection debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f) after he received the SOR, but he presented no \npayment records. He made no progress toward resolving the $37,193 and $4,483 charged-\noff debts. Applicant asserts an intention to repay the debts when he sells his home \nbecause the bank has a lien against his property. The Appeal Board has consistently held \nthat a promise to pay a debt in the future is not a substitute for a track record of paying \ndebts in a timely manner. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-05390 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, \n2010). While Applicant testified that he received a 1099 form for $9,999 from the creditor in \n\n11 \n \n2017, and that he reported it on his income tax returns, the form itself is not in evidence, \nand he could not explain it. Neither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to the charged-off \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) was not established. Applicant asserted that he paid on the account in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a for several years before he fell behind. He disputed the terms of the account in \nthat the bank converted it to a mortgage loan, but he learned that it was allowed under the \nterms of the contract. \n \nApplicant is not required to pay off every one of his past-due debts before he can be \ngranted security clearance eligibility. However, some concerns persist about his financial \nstability. His home mortgage was past due 30 days in March 2017 before his medical issue \nin May 2017. His short-term disability in the summer of 2017 explains why he was past due \n30 days on his mortgage in August 2017, but he was again 30 days past due on his \nmortgage from January 2018 to May 2018. He had vehicle expenses in late 2017 that may \nnot have been discretionary and caused some financial strain. His retirement income of \n$1,300 is more than ample to cover his car payments. He did not adequately explain or \ndocument why he has been unable to catch up on his mortgage payments in 2018 when \nhe is earning $93,000 in base salary with a defense contractor. More progress is needed \ntoward resolving the past-due debts to mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). It is not a proceeding designed to \ncollect debts. At the same time, it is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an \napplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or \nrenewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990). Applicant obtained a secured line of credit without fully understanding the terms of \nthe contract, but this does not excuse him from his contractual liability. Based on the \nevidence presented, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility at this time. \n\n12 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective after June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 2, 2018.  He requested that his case be \ndecided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing.  (Item 2.)  On \nAugust 2, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A \ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing 11 Items, was mailed \nto Applicant on August 3, 2018, and received by him on August 23, 2018.  The FORM \nnotified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant failed to respond to the FORM.  Applicant did not object to Items 1 through 11, \nand they are also admitted into evidence.  Hereinafter, they are referenced as \nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 11.   \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 36 years old.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a \nProtective Security Officer.  He is seeking to retain a security clearance in connection \nwith his employment.  Applicant began working for his current employer in September \n2015.   \n \nGuideline G \u2013 Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has engaged in excessive alcohol \nconsumption, which often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure \nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline.  \n(Government Exhibit 4.)  He has a history of alcohol abuse that began in about 2001 at \nthe age of 20, when he joined the Army.  His alcohol abuse has continued over the past \nfourteen years, until at least 2017.  He has been arrested for Driving While Intoxicated \n(DWI) on three occasions.  In 2001, Applicant was arrested in North Carolina and \ncharged with Driving While Intoxicated.  Applicant was stopped at a DWI check point \nand found to be intoxicated with a blood alcohol content of .18%.  (Government Exhibit \n6.)  The charges were eventually dropped due to the fact that Applicant was serving in \nthe military and had moved out of the state.  Applicant was arrested in January 2008 in \nWashington D.C., and was charged with Driving While Intoxicated and Speeding.  \nApplicant was pulled over while driving for going 80 mph in a 35 mph zone.  Prior to \ndriving, Applicant has been drinking at a bar.  Applicant was also found to be \nintoxicated. In July 2008, he was convicted of Driving While Intoxicated and placed on \none years of supervised probation.  In 2009, while still on probation for his 2008 offense, \nApplicant was arrested in Virginia and charged with Driving While Intoxicated 2nd \nOffense within five years.  Applicant was pulled over on his way home from a party \nbecause he was driving 90 mph.  He refused a breathalyzer and was arrested and \ncharged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI), Reckless Driving, and Refusal.  \nApplicant was convicted of DUI and Reckless Driving.  He was sentenced to 180 days \nin jail with 160 days suspended.  About this same time, he was also charged in \nMaryland with Violation of Probation from his 2008 DWI case and required to service \napproximately 20 days in jail in Maryland.  (Government Exhibits 8 and 10.)       \n \n \nSince 2009, Applicant has worked as a Security Guard.  In 2015, Applicant was \nterminated from his employment as a Security Guard for misconduct \u2013 being under the \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \ninfluence of alcohol at work.  (Government Exhibit 9.)  Applicant admits that he blacked \nout and was delusional on the day in question, although he attributes his condition to \nhigh blood sugar.  Applicant was reported to his supervisor that Applicant was drunk at \nwork.  The following day, Applicant returned to work and was asked to resign.  Applicant \nrefused to resign because he claims that the allegations against him were false.  \nInstead, he sought representation by a union representative.  (Government Exhibit 4.)  \nAt the conclusion of the investigation, Applicant was terminated. \n \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has engaged in conduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations which can raise questions about his reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), dated May 10, 2016.  (Government Exhibit 5.)  Section 22, regarding police \nrecords, asked him if he had ever been convicted in any court of the United States of a \ncrime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year for that crime, and \nincarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than 1 year?  Had he ever been \ncharged with any felony offense?  Had he ever been convicted of an offense involving \ndomestic violence or a crime of violence against your child dependent, cohabitant, \nspouse, former spouse, or someone with whom he shares a child in common?  Had he \never been charged with an offense involving firearms or explosives?  Had he ever been \ncharged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs?  Applicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d.  This \nwas a false answer. Applicant failed to Iist any of his arrests set forth in the SOR \nsubparagraphs 1.b., 1.c., and 1.d., discussed above.    \n \n \nSection 13A of the same application, regarding employment activities, asked \nabout his reason for leaving prior employment.  (Government Exhibit 5.)  Applicant \nwrote that he was terminated: accused of being inattentive on post.  This was also a \nfalse answer.  Applicant failed to list that he was terminated for being under the \ninfluence of alcohol at work.  In addition, the arrests discussed above also show poor \npersonal conduct, poor judgment, and unreliability. \n \n \nApplicant states that he failed to disclose his alcohol-related arrests in his 2016 \nE-QIP because he misread the relevant question and thought he was only required to \ndisclose incidents that occurred within seven years of the date of this e-QIP submission.  \n(Government Exhibit 4.)  With regard to his employment termination, Applicant states \nthat he thought the termination letter that he signed indicated that he was being \nterminated for being in attentive on duty.  (Government Exhibit 4.)  This argument holds \nno merit.  First, Applicant does not provide any documentation in support of this claim.  \nSecond, Applicant was well aware of his alleged intoxication at work by the fact that he \nchallenged the claim against him and forced an investigation into the matter.  His \nargument is not credible.  Applicant clearly falsified information on his security clearance  \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \napplication in May 2016, by failing to disclose any of his alcohol-related arrests and by \nproviding a false reason for his employment termination in 2015.  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable \nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an \napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \n \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The disqualifying conditions raised by the evidence are: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an \nintoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; and \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n  \n \nThe evidence shows that Applicant\u2019s three arrests, charges and convictions for \nDriving While intoxicated as well as his termination from employment show poor \njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness.  These incidents raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(b), and 22(c).   \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security \nconcerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern  of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear  and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations.  \n  \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable here.  Applicant failed to \nintroduce sufficient evidence of rehabilitation.  Although his last alcohol-related arrest \noccurred in 2009, he was terminated from his employment for being intoxicated as \nrecently as 2015.  Given the extensive nature of his drinking problem, more time without \ndrinking is needed to show the Government that he will not return to his old habits.  \u00b6 32 \ndoes not provide full mitigation. \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or \nprovide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative \nor adjudicative processes.   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any      \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form   \nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or \naward fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a while, supports a whole-person assessment of \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \n \nFrom the evidence provided, Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his arrest \nhistory and real reason he was terminated from his prior employment on his security \nclearance application.  The fact that he did not list these facts in response to questions \non his on his security clearance application indicates behavior that shows questionable \njudgment, unreliability, and untrustworthiness.     \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline G and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis.  At this time, there is \nno strong evidence in the record to show that the Applicant is now sober or will remain \nsober for any sustained period.  He has failed to present sufficient evidence of \nrehabilitation to overcome his heavy burden to mitigate his history of alcohol abuse and \npersonal conduct.  Overall, the record evidence raises doubts about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:              \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:              \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:              \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:                      Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:                      Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:                      Against Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCERVI, Gregg A., Administrative Judge \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines K (Handling \nProtected Information) and M (Use of Information Technology). Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on November 23, 2015. \nOn February 12, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines K and M.1 \nApplicant responded to the SOR on March 11, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 18, 2018. The \n1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n02/26/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on August 1, 2018, \nand the hearing was convened on August 30, 2018. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n4 were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and Applicant Exhibits \n(AE) A through D were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on September 10, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old system administrator, senior software engineer, and \ninformation systems security officer for a defense contractor, employed since 2008. \nApplicant married in 1980 and has two adult children. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n1991. He testified that he has held a DOD top secret security clearance for nearly 30 \nyears. \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline K (Handling Protected Information), that \nApplicant committed security violations in 2015 by not properly securing classified \ninformation; and in 2016 by improperly using his system administrator logins and \npasswords, in violation of his privileged user agreement. The SOR also alleges that in \n2017, his employer relieved him of his information system security officer and system \nadministrator duties and access to system accounts following several inspection items \nfrom 2016 to 2017 that showed repeated failures to comply with system security \nrequirements, policies, and procedures. The incidents described in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c \nwere cross-alleged under Guideline M (Use of Information Technology). In his Answer to \nthe SOR, Applicant admitted the two incidents in 2015 and 2016, but denied the 2017 \nallegation and the cross-allegation under Guideline M. The Government\u2019s evidence is \nsufficient to establish the SOR allegations. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant failed to properly secure classified information. \nApplicant was appointed the information systems security officer (ISSO) by his employer \nin January 2015 after the previous ISSO retired. Applicant was not fully familiar with his \nduties and responsibilities, and relied on the security team supporting him, \u201con the job \ntraining,\u201d and the supervision of the information systems security manager (ISSM). \nHistorical audit computer logs were backed up on rewritable compact discs (CD) that were \nmarked with the appropriate security classification, since the information was being \nwritten from a classified system. The CDs were kept in plastic sleeves in a portfolio binder, \nmarked with classification markings, and secured. Applicant\u2019s assistant ISSO (AISSO) \nwas required to create the CDs for a historical record, until the company transferred all of \nthe logs to external hard drives. The CDs were phased out, and another new AISSO was \ntasked to ensure the destruction of the old CDs. Applicant and his assistant emptied all \nof the CDs from their plastic sleeves in the binder, and sent the \u201cempty\u201d portfolio binder \nto a supply room to be reused. The supply room was in an access-controlled area, but \nnot a classified controlled area. The binder was later discovered by an employee with one \nCD still in a sleeve. Applicant claims the CD did not have any classified information on it, \nbut it was marked \u201cclassified\u201d because the data came from a classified computer system. \nApplicant was cited for a security violation, but there was no evidence of loss, compromise \n\n \n3 \n \nor suspected compromise of classified information found. Applicant took responsibility for \nthe mistake, was given remedial training, and never repeated this security violation again. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant improperly used his system administrator logins and \npasswords, and failed to follow user privileges and information assurance procedures. \nShortly after assuming the ISSO position, Applicant was tasked to work on an information \nsystem (IS) with which he was previously unfamiliar. He was read into the program, and \nentered the particular lab in 2015, where he first saw a completely assembled IS system. \nHe noted that the IS had not been certified, however it was already located in a special \nsecured area. Applicant was tasked to certify it by the security official for the program. At \nthe time, common practice was to allow the ISSO to log into the system using root \ncredentials, but that practice was later stopped. Applicant met with the security staff for \nthe program and explained what he needed to do to certify the IS, and Applicant \nrequested that the security department permit another system administrator (SA) who \ndeveloped the IS, to assist him. The SA was briefed by the program security officer and \npermitted to enter the space. Applicant later learned that the security official was not \nauthorized to give the SA both a general user and a privileged user briefing at once. One \nof the briefings should have been done by another security office within the company, but \nApplicant noted it was often done by the same person. According to Applicant, once the \noversight was discovered, the SA received the proper authorization \u201cwithin five minutes,\u201d \nand believed his actions were authorized and the most efficient method to accomplish the \ntask.  \n \nApplicant was also alleged to have continued to use the root account for logins \nafter the system had been certified, and that he failed to document the logins using the \nroot account for tracking and auditing purposes. Applicant explained that using the root \ncredentials was the only way to solve the problems with the IS, and that the security \ndepartment should have made logs available to be used to document occasions where \nthe root certification was used. However, Applicant took responsibility for not logging the \nuses properly, and testified that logins were in fact traceable, even without the logs. As a \nresult of the security violation, Applicant was denied access to particular programs \noperated by that military branch. No evidence of loss, compromise, or suspected \ncompromise of classified information was found. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant was relieved of his ISSO duties and access to \nsecure areas in October 2017, after self-inspections disclosed repeated failures to comply \nwith the information system configuration and operational security requirements, policies, \nand procedures. In particular, the Government\u2019s evidence shows various non-compliance \nissues with users on the system, user briefings, seal logs, incomplete permissions and \nauditing settings, poor maintenance log retention, laptop CD/DVD drive and removable \nmedia controls not configured properly, and no system warning banner displayed. In \naddition, Applicant did not correct the deficiencies within the two-week period provided. \n \nApplicant explained that he was responsible for keeping track of 200 user \nauthorizations for 18 systems. There were discussions and changes to the user \nauthorization procedures and forms during this period, and that the system in question \n\n \n4 \n \nwas housed at a military base under a mobile deployment plan to allow it to be operated \nin the field. At the same time the system was returned to Applicant\u2019s facility for audits, \npatching, and updates after a longer-than-usual period outside the facility, a self-\ninspection was conducted. Applicant supported the self-inspection and was interested in \nseeing the results so that he could make the corrections and return the system back to \nthe field. Applicant argued that the ISSM agreed with the field engineers to permit them \nto create user accounts and were responsible for the system while it was outside \nApplicant\u2019s facility. Applicant did not have physical access to the system or oversight while \nit was in the field, and the engineers improperly created new user accounts for personnel \nthat needed access while the system was deployed.  \n \nApplicant sent his ASSOs to the meeting to discuss the self-inspection findings \nbecause of a conflict, and later learned that his ASSOs did not make the simple \ncorrections to fix the deficiencies. Applicant\u2019s access was denied before he could inspect \nthe system on his own, and was not fully apprised of the deficiencies after the self-\ninspection. After being denied access, Applicant spent the next two weeks instructing his \nASSOs on how to correct the deficiencies. Applicant admits he should have been more \nforceful in demanding the list of findings of the self-inspection and more proactive in \naddressing the problems, but relied on others to do the work. Applicant agrees that he \nwas responsible for supervising his ASSOs in completing the work required, but notes \nthat security rules changed after the system was certified for deployment. He disagreed \nwith some of the findings regarding hard drives, and asserted that the ISSM shared \nresponsibility for the system, certified it for mobile deployment, and should have worked \nwith him to correct deficiencies once they were discovered, rather than deny him access. \nHe also acknowledged that he was aware of one previous user agreement deficiency \nbefore the 2017 findings, but not the other previous deficiencies noted in the self-\ninspection report. No compromise of classified information or counter-intelligence \nimplications were found as a result of the incidents discussed above. \n \nApplicant emphatically denies any intention to violate security rules or procedures \nduring any of the incidents listed in the SOR. He had never had a security violation in the \npast, despite nearly 30 years with a top secret security clearance. He believes the large \nvolume of work and poor training and directions from his manager led to the eventual \nsecurity violations. Applicant submitted a detailed narrative response to the allegations, \na 2016 security training certification, a certificate of recognition from his company, and \nother documents in support of his testimony. His testimony was comprehensive, \nstraightforward, and sincere, while always maintaining his professionalism. \n \nApplicant\u2019s former information systems security risk manager and former ISSM at \nthe company provided a signed, sworn statement of support for Applicant, and claimed \nthat three unnamed employees within the information security office targeted Applicant \nand other employees to interpret the rules to find security infractions in order to cause \nthem to lose their security clearance and job. He noted that once an infraction was found, \nthe employee had very little recourse in defense. He also noted that Applicant was \ntrustworthy, and called him an asset to the community that cares about protecting \nclassified information and a proud supporter of the warfighter. No corroborating evidence \n\n \n5 \n \nof inappropriate behavior of security personnel at the company was presented at the \nhearing, but Applicant quoted the writer\u2019s claim in his Answer to the SOR. \n \nAnother coworker attested to Applicant\u2019s good judgment, stating he would never \nknowingly violate security regulations or procedures, and noted Applicant was \nconscientious, stable, caring, and trustworthy. A director of security for another defense \ncontractor who has known Applicant since 1987 when they were friends and coworkers, \nwrote of Applicant\u2019s \u201cgreat integrity.\u201d A current engineer at Applicant\u2019s company wrote of \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, good judgment, stability, and responsibility. He notes situations \nwhere Applicant steadfastly followed security rules to maintain security compliance \nregardless of user complaints or inconvenience. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \n\n \n6 \n \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline K: Handling Protected Information \nAG \u00b6 33 expresses the handling protected information security concern: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other sensitive \ngovernment information, and proprietary information-raises doubt about an \nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \n \nRelevant conditions that could raise a security concern under AG \u00b6 34 and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n(b) collecting or storing protected information in any unauthorized location; \n \n(c) loading, drafting, editing, storing, transmitting, or otherwise handling \nprotected information, including images, on any unauthorized equipment or \nmedium; \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or sensitive \ninformation; and \n \n(h) negligence or lax security practices that persist despite counseling by \nmanagement. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nThe evidence presented is sufficient to raise the security concerns described \nabove. \n \nGuideline K includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nincidents regarding handling protected information. Relevant conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns under AG \u00b6 35 include: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; \n \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or \nunclear instructions; and \n \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \n \n \nThe security violations from 2015 to 2017 described in the SOR were adequately \naddressed and in some cases, plausibly contested by Applicant. He has held a security \nclearance for nearly 30 years without incident before these incidents occurred. There is \nsome evidence that he was appointed ISSO without sufficient training or direction. He \nacknowledged the 2015 and 2016 incidents, and took responsibility for not adequately \nsupervising his assistants in response to the 2017 self-inspection report. He noted that \nhe should have been more proactive and aggressive in ensuring he understood the \ndeficiencies and addressed them in a timely manner. However, Applicant generally \ndenies responsibility for the 2017 deficiencies found on a system that was outside his \ncontrol for an extended period of time, and operated under an agreement between his \nmanager and the company engineers. \n \nRegardless of the actual security violations imputed to Applicant by reason of his \ndirect action or supervisory responsibilities, the evidence does not suggest a pattern of \nrules violations outside of isolated incidents. There was no compromise of classified \ninformation, and the counter-intelligence review did not reveal a concern. There is \nadequate evidence to suggest that Applicant attempted to perform his duties as assigned, \nbut the direction and training were insufficient to prevent the security incidents from \noccurring. Disputes over subject matter knowledge or work performance do not \nnecessarily implicate security concerns. Applicant did not hide any incidents, and \naccepted responsibility for his role and willingly participated in retraining when offered. \nBased on his limited experience as an ISSO, he is now more attuned to the potential \npitfalls while performing similar tasks. Applicant is strongly supported by his former ISSM \n\n \n8 \n \nand co-workers who attest to his trustworthiness and security consciences. AG \u00b6\u00b6 35(a), \n(b), (c), and (d) apply. \n \nGuideline M: Use of Information Technology Systems \n \n \nAG \u00b6 39 expresses the security concern pertaining to use of information \ntechnology systems: \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. \n \nRelevant conditions that could raise a security concern under AG \u00b6 40 and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n(g) negligence or lax security practices in handling information technology \nthat persists despite counseling by management. \n \nThe evidence presented is minimally sufficient to raise the security concern \ndescribed above, and a similar security concern is included under AG \u00b6 34 (Guideline K). \nThe findings of fact, discussion, reasoning, and mitigation applicable under Guideline K, \napply equally to the concern raised under Guideline M, and are incorporated herein. \nTherefore, no additional discussion of Guideline M concerns is required. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines K and M, in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s long history of employment and security eligibility. I am convinced that the \nsecurity incidents identified in the SOR were unintentional, isolated incidents. No \ncompromise of classified information was found. Based on the testimony and \ndocumentary evidence, I am convinced that these incident are behind him and similar \nviolations are unlikely to recur. I have no doubts about Applicant\u2019s judgment, honesty, \nand trustworthiness. \n \n\n \n9 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n  Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n   \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n  Subparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n   _______________________ \nGregg A.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of January 16, 2018, Applicant was past due $14,588 on a mortgage in foreclosure status with a $109,401 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that he owed charged-off credit card balances of $11,984 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and $8,070 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). When he responded to the SOR in March 2018, Applicant admitted the debts, which he attributed to loss of a job and an economic downturn in the information technology sector in his previous locale, which made it difficult for him to find a job at an income needed to cover all his financial obligations. He indicated that the mortgage delinquency was settled without a final judgment of foreclosure. Applicant explained that he had no success in negotiating a settlement of the credit card debts. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 46-year-old information technology network engineer. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science awarded in June 1996, and a master\u2019s degree in business administration awarded in December 2000. He began working for his current employer, a defense contractor, in September 2016. (GEs 1-2.) Applicant and his ex-wife married in March 1998 and purchased a home. They had a daughter in 2001. In April 2004, they moved to a new locale. They bought a home, obtaining a mortgage loan for $60,000. They began having marital difficulties, and decided to separate in 2006. (GE 1; Tr. 40-41.)

Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant defaulted on a mortgage loan and on two credit-card accounts. The \nmortgage was released after he abandoned the property. He made no payments on \n$20,054 in charged-off credit-card delinquencies because they are no longer legally \ncollectible. Concerns about his financial judgment persist. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 16, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD \nCAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n12/17/2018\n\n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on March 1, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On July \n18, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. On August 6, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for September 18, 2018. \n \nAt the hearing, five Government exhibits (GEs 1-5) were admitted. A March 28, \n2018 letter forwarding the proposed GEs to Applicant was marked as a hearing exhibit (HE \n1) for the record but not admitted in evidence. Six Applicant exhibits (AEs A-F) were \nadmitted in evidence. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on \nSeptember 27, 2018. \n \nI held the record open, initially for six weeks, for post-hearing documentation from \nApplicant. On October 29, 2018, Applicant submitted a letter from an attorney (AE G), and \nrequested a three-week extension to submit more evidence. On November 5, 2018, \nDepartment Counsel expressed no objection to AE G, but opposed an additional extension \non the basis that Applicant had made little attempt in the time allotted to contact his \ncreditors. I admitted AE G into the record and extended the deadline to November 26, \n2018. On November 8, 2017, Applicant submitted comments by email, which I accepted \ninto the record as AE H without any response from the Government. On November 26, \n2018, Applicant submitted an email with a billing statement from his attorney, which was \nmarked as AE I and entered into evidence, the Government having no objections. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of January 16, 2018, Applicant was \npast due $14,588 on a mortgage in foreclosure status with a $109,401 balance (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a), and that he owed charged-off credit card balances of $11,984 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and \n$8,070 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). When he responded to the SOR in March 2018, Applicant admitted \nthe debts, which he attributed to loss of a job and an economic downturn in the information \ntechnology sector in his previous locale, which made it difficult for him to find a job at an \nincome needed to cover all his financial obligations. He indicated that the mortgage \ndelinquency was settled without a final judgment of foreclosure. Applicant explained that he \nhad no success in negotiating a settlement of the credit card debts. After considering the \npleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old information technology network engineer. He has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in computer science awarded in June 1996, and a master\u2019s degree in \nbusiness administration awarded in December 2000. He began working for his current \nemployer, a defense contractor, in September 2016. (GEs 1-2.) \n \nApplicant and his ex-wife married in March 1998 and purchased a home. They had \na daughter in 2001. In April 2004, they moved to a new locale. They bought a home, \nobtaining a mortgage loan for $60,000. They began having marital difficulties, and decided \nto separate in 2006. (GE 1; Tr. 40-41.) They sold their marital home for approximately what \nthey owed on the mortgage. They also sold a parcel of land to settle some debts. In August \n\n3 \n \n2006, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife purchased a home for herself and their daughter. She paid for \nthe home in part with an $88,400 mortgage loan on which Applicant was also liable. The \nmortgage payments were $768 a month. Applicant resided with his ex-wife and his \ndaughter until February 2007, when he purchased a residence for himself with a mortgage \nloan of $101,200, on which his ex-wife was also liable (SOR \u00b6 1.a). His mortgage loan \npayments were approximately $916 monthly. They jointly obtained a $25,300 home-equity \nloan, to be repaid at $103 monthly. Applicant was employed as an information technology \nmanager at the time. (Answer; GEs 1-5; AE F; Tr. 40-42, 45-46.) \n \nApplicant and his ex-wife were able to maintain the mortgage payments on their \nrespective residences for a few years. In March 2009, Applicant left his job of six years \nafter his employer hired someone else to maintain a program that Applicant had \nupgraded.1  Applicant started his own computer business, but his self-employment income \nwas not sufficient to cover all of his bills. He relied on credit cards, retirement savings, and \nfinancial assistance from his father, to pay his living expenses, mortgage, and car payment. \nHe obtained a car loan of $13,982 in July 2007 that he repaid at $277 a month until it was \nfully satisfied in January 2012. (Answer; GEs 1-2; Tr. 42, 47.) \n \nIn July 2012, Applicant and his ex-wife became delinquent on the mortgage loan \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) and on the home-equity loan for his then residence. Applicant consulted with a \nrealtor in late September 2012 for help with the paperwork \u201cto get out from under the \nhouse.\u201d Applicant moved out of the house in November 2012 (Tr. 47-48) and prepared \npaperwork to deed the property in lieu of foreclosure, which the lender rejected in April \n2013. (AE E.) The lender wanted to do a short sale, but rejected an offer of $50,000 for the \nproperty. (Tr. 43.) When the mortgage account became past due for $14,588, the lender \ninitiated foreclosure proceedings. (GEs 1-5.) \n \nIn February 2013, Applicant obtained part-time employment with a home-\nimprovement retailer. (GE 1; Tr. 43.) His credit-card account in SOR \u00b6 1.b was closed in \nMarch 2013 for nonpayment since December 19, 2012. A credit line obtained in February \n2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) was likewise closed in March 2013 for nonpayment after December 19, \n2012. As of August 2016, the balances of the charged-off accounts were $11,984 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b) and $8,070 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Another credit-card account, which had a credit limit of \n$7,200 but a high credit of $12,369, was placed for collection after no payments were \nmade after February 2013. Applicant settled the debt for less than its full balance by \nJanuary 2014. (GE 3.) \n \n \nWith his divorce not yet finalized, Applicant relocated to his present area in August \n2013 for a full-time position with the home-improvement retailer. He took on a second job \nwith another retailer for a short time, and was able to pay his bills but not get ahead. (GE 1; \nAE E; Tr. 43-44.) On October 10, 2013, the lender released the mortgage on his previous \nresidence, and on October 31, 2013, issued a 1099-A Form, Acquisition of Abandonment \n                                                 \n1 Applicant indicated on his August 2016 security clearance application that he left his job for \u201chealth reasons.\u201d \n(GE 1.) When he responded to the SOR, he indicated that he lost his job after the employer hired someone at \na much lower salary to maintain the system Applicant upgraded. (Answer.) He provided no documentation \nshowing that he was laid off.  \n\n4 \n \nof Secured Property.2 At the time, Applicant and his ex-wife owed a principal balance of \n$91,282 on their mortgage loan, and the property was valued at $105,570. (AE F; 42-44, \n48.) Applicant\u2019s understanding was that he and his ex-wife no longer had any obligation on \nthe loan or on the home-equity loan. (Tr. 49.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s gross income for tax purposes was $31,005 in 2014, $30,696 in 2015, \nand $21,609 in 2016. (AE B.) He collected worker\u2019s compensation in 2016 after injuring his \nknee on the job, which was not taxable. (Tr. 44-45.) \n \n \nOn August 2, 2016, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) to work for his current employer. In \nresponse to the delinquency involving routine accounts, Applicant listed the delinquent \nmortgage, which he indicated was resolved in October 2013 through return of the property. \nHe also listed the defaulted home-equity line of credit as resolved in October 2013. \nApplicant listed the charged-off credit card for $11,984 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and indicated that he \nhad not taken any actions to resolve it because of a lack of income. He disclosed the \ndefaulted credit account for $8,070 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), but stated in part: \u201cChecking\u2014I received a \n\u2018gains\u2019 tax form for a write off but still shows on credit report\u2014will need to call and correct \nthem showing that I owe money.\u201d (GE 1.) In September 2016, Applicant began working for \nhis current employer at an annual salary of $80,000. (Tr. 57.) \n \n \nOn September 28, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant explained that he signed over the \ndeed in lieu of foreclosure to resolve the defaulted mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and related \nhome-equity loans on the property. He indicated that he could not maintain the loan \npayments because of low-paying jobs and insufficient income while self-employed. He \nasserted that he was still in negotiations with his creditors to settle his $11,984 and $8,020 \ncredit-card delinquencies. He had settled a $12,369 credit-card collection debt for $2,000. \nApplicant volunteered that he began working part time for the home-improvement retailer in \nearly September 2017 in addition to maintaining his full-time job with a defense contractor.3 \n(GE 2.) \n                                                 \n2 As the borrower, Applicant was instructed on the 1099-A that if he abandoned the property, he may have \nincome from the discharge of indebtedness in the amount of the unpaid balance of his cancelled debt. (AE F.) \nThe market value of the property as of October 2013 exceeded the principal loan balance by $14,288.34, but \nApplicant and his ex-wife were $14,588 past-due on the loan at the time it was released. There is no evidence \nthat the lender has pursued Applicant for any deficiency, even though the debt was still on his credit record as \nof March 2018. (GE 5.) For tax purposes, abandonment is treated differently from foreclosure. Generally, \nabandonment is not treated as a sale or exchange of the property while a foreclosure is treated as a sale or \nexchange. If the amount realized from an abandonment is more than an individual\u2019s adjusted basis, it amounts \nto a gain, if less, then it is a loss. See IRS Publication 544.  If property is abandoned that secures a debt for \nwhich one is personally liable (recourse debt) and the debt is cancelled, the individual realizes ordinary income \nequal to the canceled debt. That income must be reported on an individual\u2019s tax return unless one of the \nexceptions or exclusions applies. See IRS Publication 4681. There is no evidence that the mortgage holder \nissued a 1099-C cancelling the debt. As to whether Applicant reported release of responsibility for the debt as \nincome on his tax returns for 2013, Applicant testified that an accountant handled his and his then wife\u2019s \nincome tax returns, which were filed separately. He indicated that he did not receive a copy of his return and \ncould provide no information in that regard. (Tr. 62-63.) \n  \n3Applicant testified at his September 2018 hearing that he has held the part-time job for four or five months. \n\n5 \n \n  \nIn November 2017, Equifax reported the delinquent mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.a) as \n$14,588 past due as of November 2014. The defaulted credit cards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c) \nwere reported as unpaid charge-offs. (GE 4.) In January 2018, the DOD CAF issued an \nSOR to Applicant because of the mortgage and two credit-card delinquencies. In response \nto the SOR, Applicant indicated that the mortgage was settled without a foreclosure, but \nthat he had been unable \u201cto get any recourse\u201d regarding the credit-card debts. (Answer.) \nAs of March 2018, the mortgage was on his credit record as a \u201cforeclosure\u201d and past due \nfor $14,588. No payments had been made toward the $11,984 and $8,070 charged-off \ncredit delinquencies. Applicant was making payments on terms acceptable to his creditor \non a credit card with a $1,000 limit opened in January 2017. (GE 5.) The card is self-\nfunded in that Applicant deposits $1,000 and can charge against his balance. (Tr. 58.) \n \n \nApplicant purchased a legal plan through his part-time job with the home-\nimprovement retailer, and in approximately July 2018, he consulted with an attorney, \nprimarily about routine legal services. (Tr. 54.) Applicant advised the attorney that he had \ntwo old credit-card accounts that he last used six years ago and were closed in 2013. The \nattorney advised him to look into the applicable state statute of limitations regarding debt \ncollection. According to Applicant, the attorney stated that if it was close to the date barring \nlegal collection, he would suggest \u201cjust let it ride.\u201d (Tr. 29-30.) Applicant already knew that \nthe state in which he incurred his credit debts has a three-year statute of limitations for \ncredit-card debts. (Tr. 56.) He learned that the state has a five-year statute of limitations on \nwritten contracts, and that the state in which he has resided since August 2013 was more \nfavorable to creditors in that it has a six-year statute of limitations for all financial contracts. \n(AEs D, G; Tr. 56.) Applicant considered the credit-card delinquencies \u201coff the books and \noff [his] plate.\u201d Thinking he had a slim chance of obtaining the security clearance needed to \nkeep his job, he made no effort to resolve his delinquent debts as of September 2018. (AE \nD; Tr. 49-50, 56.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current annual income from his defense-contractor job is approximately \n$80,105. (Tr. 44-45, 51, 57.) He had $3,635 in combined checking account deposits as of \nSeptember 2018, but his rent check had not yet cleared. (Tr. 26.) He had $13,272 in his \nsavings accounts. (AE C.) Applicant has been building his savings for emergency \nexpenses because of his difficulty getting consumer credit. (Tr. 51-52.) He averaged \n$2,195 in monthly bill expenses from April 2018 to September 2018, which included rent at \n$1,435 per month but excluded food, personal care items, and other miscellaneous \nexpenses. (AE B.) Applicant pays $100 in child support per month and has his daughter on \nhis health insurance. (Tr. 52.) Applicant recently purchased a motorcycle for $700 cash that \nhe uses on occasion to keep down the mileage on his 2007 model-year vehicle, which has \n160,000 miles on the engine. (Tr. 53.) \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant admitted that he did not want to reach out to his creditors to \nresolve the credit-card delinquencies because it would \u201crestart the time clock\u201d on the debts \nif he was going to be denied security clearance eligibility because of the defaulted \nmortgage. (Tr. 30.) He expressed a willingness to contact his creditors and attempt good-\n                                                                                                                                                             \n(Tr. 57.) He discrepantly gave a start date of September 9, 2017, for his part-time employment during his \nsubject interview in late September 2017. (GE 2.) The discrepancy was not clarified. \n\n6 \n \nfaith settlements. I held the record open for over two months for Applicant to present \nevidence of settlement efforts. Applicant presented a letter from his attorney who rendered \nhis professional opinion that Applicant\u2019s debts are no longer legally collectible because the \nlaws of the state where the debts were incurred are likely controlling, and it has been more \nthan three years since Applicant\u2019s last payment on the credit accounts. Regarding the \ndefaulted mortgage, the attorney indicated that the five-year statute of limitations for written \ncontracts has expired because Applicant defaulted on the loan before the October 31, \n2013 date of abandonment of the property. (AE G.) The attorney billed Applicant $1,091 for \nhis services providing advice and his legal opinion on the debt matters. (AE I.) \n \n \nOn November 8, 2018, Applicant explained that he would have resolved his past-\ndue credit-card debts two years ago if he had not been told by a co-worker that he would \nbe disqualified from having a security clearance granted if he had a bankruptcy or a \nforeclosure on his record. Applicant requested that he be granted three months to address \nhis credit issues, and that, if he fails to do so, Department Counsel could appeal a \nfavorable grant. (AE H.) I held the record open to November 26, 2018, for proof of any \nefforts to resolve the SOR debts. On November 26, 2018, Applicant responded that he \nused the time to contact his creditors, but he had not been able to resolve the issues. He \nadmitted that he is \u201cconflicted\u201d about resolving the debts because they are so close to \ndropping from his credit record, but that to get a clearance and work the issue in a short \ntime as a requirement for continued employment would be the only option to \u201caccept the \npunishment of having 7 more years of bad debt.\u201d (AE I.)  \n  \n \nApplicant provides engineering support for a U.S. military program on a military \nbase. The program manager has been able to rely on him \u201cto be polite, inquisitive, \nprofessional and a team player in any area of [their] work.\u201d Applicant has been \u201cpunctual, \ndedicated and passionate about his work.\u201d (AE A.) \n \n \nApplicant also provided character reference letters from personal associates and \nfriends. Applicant has been active in his church. He has demonstrated honesty and \nreliability in his dealings with his pastor. A longtime friend also attested to Applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness. A former co-worker and small business partner indicated that Applicant \nhas always upheld the strictest of moral standards. Applicant was described as \u201cefficient, \ndetail-oriented, and extremely competent\u201d by a former colleague. They met in 1999 while \nperforming contract work for a defense contractor. Applicant has been \u201ca go-to resource\u201d \nfor him on more than one occasion when he needed help on projects. He has known \nApplicant to \u201clead by example when it came to ensuring the safety and security of \ninformation and people both professionally and personally.\u201d (AE A.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \n\n7 \n \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \n\n8 \n \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the available credit reports establish the delinquencies \nalleged in the SOR. In 2012, Applicant and his ex-wife defaulted on a mortgage loan for his \nthen residence. Applicant made no payments on the credit cards in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c \nafter December 2012, and his accounts were closed in March 2013 because of \nnonpayment. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply. Moreover, AG \u00b6 19(b), \u201cunwillingness to \nsatisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so,\u201d is implicated. Applicant chose to ignore the \ncredit-card delinquencies even after obtaining his present job at a salary of $80,000 a year \nbecause collection was legally barred in the state in which he incurred the debts. \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply. One or \nmore of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n\n9 \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nAlthough the delinquencies were incurred more than five years ago, AG \u00b6 20(a) is \nnot mitigating of his years of disregard of his legitimate indebtedness. He has made no \npayments toward the debts, even though they continue to adversely affect his credit. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has some applicability in that the debts were caused by \nunderemployment. Whether he resigned voluntarily from his job in March 2009 for health \nreasons, was laid off, or forced out when his employer hired someone else to manage the \nsystem he had upgraded, Applicant was unable to find work in the information technology \nsector for the income needed to meet all his financial obligations. As a self-employed \ncomputer engineer, he had no control over the market for his services. Even though his \ndebts may be attributed to conditions beyond his control, Applicant must also demonstrate \nthat he acted responsibly under the circumstances to address his delinquent debts. \nRegarding the delinquent mortgage, he offered to deed the property in lieu of foreclosure \nand tried a short sale before the lender deemed the property abandoned and released the \nmortgage. Applicant and his spouse were $14,588 past due on their loan at the time. He \nwas released from the mortgage in October 2013, although there is no indication that his \ndebt was cancelled. Even giving him some time to stabilize his finances after he began his \ndefense-contractor employment in September 2016, he did not demonstrate an adherence \nto his financial obligations by ignoring known credit card delinquencies because they were \nno longer legally collectible in the state where the debts were incurred. \n \nNeither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) has been shown to fully apply. There is no \nevidence that Applicant is being pursued for any debt on the mortgage loan. However, \nabandonment of a financial obligation is not a good-faith effort to resolve a debt. Regarding \nthe statute of limitations, the Appeal Board recently reaffirmed its long-held position about \ndebts that are no longer legally collectible, as follows: \n \nThe security significance of long delinquent debts is not diminished merely \nbecause the debts have become legally unenforceable owing to the passage \nof time. Security clearance decisions are not controlled or limited by any \nstatute of limitation, and reliance on the non-collectability of a debt does not \nconstitute a good-faith effort to resolve that debt within the meaning of the \nDirective. A security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at \ncollecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts. Rather a security clearance \nadjudication is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness to make a decision about the applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility. Accordingly, even if a delinquent debt is legally \nunenforceable . . . , the federal government is entitled to consider the facts \n\n10 \n \nand circumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and failing \nto satisfy the debt in a timely manner. \n \nISCR Case No. 17-01473 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2018) (quoting ISCR Case No. 10-03656 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 19, 2011)). \n \nApplicant was on notice as of his September 2017 interview that his delinquent \ndebts were of concern to the DOD. He indicated at that time that he was still under \nnegotiations to settle his delinquent credit-card accounts. He now admits that he did not \nintend to resolve them because the statute of limitations had run. Even before he consulted \nwith an attorney in July 2018, he did not see a reason to address his delinquent debts, \nthinking that he had a slim chance of obtaining a security clearance. While it may be \nfinancially advantageous for Applicant to wait for the debts to drop from his credit report, it \ncasts doubt on his judgment and reliability with regard to complying with security rules and \nregulations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation has stabilized in that he is able to meet all of his \ncurrent financial obligations. He has managed to accumulate approximately $13,272 in \nsavings, which would indicate that he has some funds available to make payments toward \nhis delinquent debts. After his hearing, Applicant requested that he be granted a security \nclearance conditionally for two to three months to give him time to address his debts, and if \nhe fails to do so, the Government can then appeal the favorable grant. I have considered \nthe exceptions in Appendix C of the Directive4 and decline to apply them, particularly in this \ncase where Applicant was given more than two months after his hearing to show that he is \ncurrently engaged in any debt-resolution efforts or repayment plans. While he may now be \nwilling to accept \u201cthe punishment of having 7 more years of bad debt,\u201d it is not enough to \nwarrant an exception. The Appeal Board has consistently held that a promise to pay a debt \nin the future is not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner. See \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 09-05390 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2010). Applicant has not mitigated \nthe financial considerations security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant has been a productive and dedicated employee for a defense contractor. \nHis government customer has been able to rely on him for engineering support. Yet, it is \nwell settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \n                                                 \n4 Appendix C of Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4 grants DOHA administrative judges the \ndiscretionary authority to grant initial or continued eligibility for a security clearance despite the presence of an \nissue(s) that can be partially but not completely mitigated with the provision of additional security measures. \n\n11 \n \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). For the reasons \nnoted, I cannot find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant \nsecurity-clearance eligibility at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it not is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINTZELMAN, Caroline E., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the drug involvement and substance abuse and \npersonal conduct, and criminal conduct security concerns. National security eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  \n \nHistory of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 30, 2016. On \nMarch 20, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse, Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct. Applicant \nanswered the SOR on April 26, 2018 (Answer), and requested a decision on the record \nwithout a hearing.  \n \nOn June 25, 2018, a complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), \ncontaining seven Items, was mailed to Applicant. The FORM notified Applicant that he \nhad an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. Applicant did not respond to the \nFORM. Items 1 through 7 are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on \nOctober 29, 2018.  \n \n  12/13/2018\n\n \n \n2\nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 27 years old, single, and has no children. He received a high school \ndiploma in June 2010, and he has attended some college courses. He has worked for a \ndefense contractor since June 2016, and this is his first security clearance application. \n \n Applicant started using and purchasing marijuana in 2010, when he was \napproximately 18 years old. He has admitted to using and purchasing marijuana until at \nleast May 2016. \n \nIn September 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of an \nillegal substance with the intent to distribute. He disclosed this arrest in his June 2016 \nSCA. The charges were ultimately dismissed. (Item 4 at 15-16) \n \nThe arresting officers noted that they saw a passenger in Applicant\u2019s car pass him \na joint of marijuana, and Applicant admitted that he used marijuana while operating his \nvehicle. They detected a strong odor of marijuana when they approached Applicant\u2019s car. \nThe officers found several discarded marijuana roaches, a burning marijuana joint, \nmultiple baggies of marijuana, and other drug-related paraphernalia in Applicant\u2019s car. \nThe two other individuals in the car were also arrested, and one admitted to the arresting \nofficers that he had recently been arrested for selling marijuana. (Item 6)  \n \nIn his PSI, Applicant claimed two individuals paid him to give them a ride in his car. \nWhen the police searched his car they found a bag of marijuana, it did not belong to him, \nbut he was aware it was in his vehicle. The charges against Applicant were dropped after \nthe presiding judge determined that the search and seizure during the arrest was illegal. \n(Item 4 at 15-16) \n \nApplicant did not disclose his history of using and purchasing marijuana in his June \n2016 SCA. (Item 3 at 35) During his September 2017 PSI, Applicant told the government \ninvestigator that he purchased and smoked three to five joints of marijuana a week from \nSeptember 2010 until May 2016. He did not list this information on his SCA, because he \nwas concerned he would lose his job. Additionally, he told the investigator that he does \nnot intend to use marijuana in the future. (Item 4 at 16-17) \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d1 As Commander in Chief, the \nPresident has the authority to \u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security \nand to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation.\u201d2 The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n2 Egan at 527. \n \n\n \n \n3\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d3 \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAdverse clearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and \nshall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d4 Thus, \na decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met \nthe strict guidelines the President and the Security Executive Agent have established for \nissuing national security eligibility. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.5 \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than \na scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d6 The guidelines presume a nexus or rational \nconnection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an \napplicant\u2019s security suitability.7 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.8 An applicant has the burden of proving a potential mitigating condition, and the \nburden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.9 \n                                                          \n3 Executive Order (EO) 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \n4 EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n5 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n \n6 See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n7  See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n8 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n9 ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n\n \n \n4\n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d10 \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d11 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, but because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \n \nApplicant admitted he purchased and used marijuana two to three times a week \nfor almost six years. The record evidence raised both disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe burden shifted to Appellant to rebut or prove mitigation of the resulting security \nconcerns. AG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n                                                          \n \n10 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n11 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see also AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \n\n \n \n5\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nGiven Applicant\u2019s frequency of marijuana use, his period of abstinence is \ninsufficient to mitigate his lengthy history of use. He told the government investigator that \nhe no longer associates with the people with whom he used marijuana, but there is limited \ncorroborating evidence that Applicant has changed his lifestyle and behavior. Mitigation \nwas not established under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b). \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n\n \n \n6\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nIn this case, Appellant admitted that he intentionally falsified his SCA. The \nevidence established the above disqualifying condition. \nAG \u00b6 17 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nApplicant failed to disclose derogatory information regarding use of marijuana in \nhis SCA. Over a year later, he admitted during his PSI that he did not disclose his drug \nuse because he was afraid his history would affect his ability to hold his job. The \ngovernment relies upon applicants to be honest and forthright during the security \napplication process. Applicant was not honest regarding his extensive period of marijuana \nuse. There is no evidence that he made proactive efforts to disclose this derogatory \ninformation to his employer in the fifteen months between his completion of the SCA and \nhis PSI. Mitigation was not established under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(c).    \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct  \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n \nAppellant\u2019s drug-related 2012 arrest establishes the above disqualifying condition.  \n\n \n \n7\n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised in this \ncase. The following two are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nIt has been over six years since Applicant\u2019s 2012 arrest.

Thompson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n02/19/2019\n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \nBased on a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. Applicant did not present sufficient information and \ndocuments to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 13, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to retain a security clearance required for a position \nwith a contractor for a government agency. After reviewing the background \ninvestigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) could not make the affirmative findings \nrequired to grant a security clearance. DOD issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), dated January 23, 2018, detailing security concerns for financial considerations \nunder Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order E.O.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective in the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n\n  2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 5, 2018. She admitted the six allegations \nof delinquent debt, but contested the amount of the debt in SOR 1.d. Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on March 23, 2018, and I was assigned the case on \nJuly 19, 2018. DOD issued a notice of hearing on September 21, 2018, for a hearing on \nOctober 25, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The Government\u2019s two exhibits \n(GX 1-2) were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified, and \nintroduced three exhibits (AX A-C) that were admitted into the record without objection. I \nleft the record open for Applicant to submit additional documents. Applicant timely \nsubmitted four additional documents that I marked and admitted into the record as AX D \nthrough G. Department Counsel had no objection to the admission of the documents. \n(GX 3, e-mail, dated November 16, 2018) I received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nNovember 2, 2018, and the record closed on November 16, 2018, on receipt of the \npost-hearing documents.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. Applicant is 36 years old. She graduated from high school in \n2000, and has completed studies for and received a real estate agent\u2019s license. She \nmarried in August 2007, and she and her husband had twins together. Her husband has \na child from a previous relationship. Her husband became disabled in 2010. He cannot \nwork and receives disability. Applicant and her husband do not live together, and he \ndoes not contribute on a recurrent basis to Applicant for family support.  \n \nApplicant has been an executive assistant for a government agency since 2002. \nShe received her first security clearance in 2002. Her monthly net pay is $3,600, with \nmonthly expenses of approximately $3,300, leave her approximately $300 monthly in \ndiscretionary income. (Tr. 13-21, 33-35; GX 1, E-QIP, dated March 13, 2017) \n \nThe SOR lists, and a credit report (GX 2, dated June 29, 2017) confirms the \nfollowing delinquent debts for Applicant: an automobile loan charged-off for $10,578 \n(SOR 1.a); another automobile loan in collection for $7,166 (SOR 1.b); a telephone \nservice debt in collection for $1,182 (SOR 1.c); a charged-off account for furniture for \n$1,057 (SOR 1.d); a utility debt in collection for $1,495 (SOR 1.e); and a communication \nservice debt in collection for $800 (SOR 1.f). The total amount of the delinquent debt is \napproximately $21,000.  \n \nApplicant stated that her financial problems started in 2010 when her husband \ncould not work because of a disability from a kidney transplant. Even though she was \nno longer responsible for support of her husband, she lost his income. She had twins in \n2010, becoming a single mother responsible for totally supporting her children on one \nincome. She did not have sufficient income to keep current with her bills. (Tr. 17-21) \n \nApplicant testified that she had been making the car payments associated with \nthe debt at SOR 1.a. She missed a few payments and the amount of the payments, \ninterest, and penalties were added to the end of her loan. She stated she did not know \n\n  3 \n \nthat the missed payments were accruing both penalties and interest. The balance of the \ndebt listed in the SOR includes the amount of the missed payments and the additional \nfees. The creditor requested full payment, but Applicant did not have the funds for the \nrequested payment. The creditor repossessed the car. Applicant does not believe she \nreceived credit for the value of the repossessed car. However, she did not provide any \ndocuments to verify any contact with the creditor establishing the reasons for the debt.  \n \nApplicant received a settlement offer of payment of $3,700 by March 2019. \nApplicant stated her intention to pay the settlement, but she did has not provided any \ndocumentation to establish that she made any payments towards the settlement \nagreement. (Tr. 21-25; AX A, Letter, dated October 5, 2018) \n \nThe debt at SOR 1.b is for a vehicle that Applicant cosigned for her husband. At \nthe time that he purchased the vehicle, her husband was working and he could afford \nthe vehicle. After purchasing the car, he required a kidney transplant and could no \nlonger work, and he could not afford to make payments on the vehicle. The creditor \nwanted full payment of the debt. Since Applicant only had one income, she could not \nafford to make the payments. Applicant reached a payment arrangement with the \ncreditor in October 2018 for payment of $100 per month on the debt. Applicant provided \na receipt for the one payment she made in October 2018. She stated her intention to \ncontinue to make payments. However, she has not provided any documents to verify \nshe that she has continued to make the payments. (Tr. 25-27) \n \nThe debt at SOR 1.c is for television-cable service. Most of the debt is for \nequipment that Applicant claims was returned. Applicant does not have a receipt to \nshow that she returned the equipment. However, Applicant\u2019s latest bill from the \ncompany received on November 16, 2018, is for $76.44. There is no listing in the bill for \nequipment. This indicates that the cost of the equipment has been paid or Applicant \nreceived credit for the equipment she returned. This debt is resolved for Applicant. (Tr. \n27-29; AX D, Bill, dated November 16, 2018) \n \nThe debt in collection at SOR 1.d is for furniture. Applicant claims to have made \npayments on the debt at the furniture store. She does not have a receipt for the \npayments, and she disputes the amount of the debt. She claims the debt is only \n$542.43 because of the payments she claims were made. She stated that she intends \nto pay the debt in monthly payments. She has not provided information to verify she has \ncontinued to make the payments. (Tr. 29)  \n \nApplicant has not made any payment on the utility debt at SOR 1.e. She plans to \nresolve the debt before the end of 2018. She did not provide any documents concerning \nany payments made on the debt. (Tr. 29-30) \n \nThe debt at SOR 1.f is for television-cable service that Applicant had at a \nprevious location. She believes the debt was paid, but she does not have a receipt. \nApplicant now has cable service with the same provider. Her latest bill shows that her \n\n  4 \n \npayments are current and that her current bill of $388.77 is a normal bill. This debt is \nresolved for Applicant. (Tr. 30-31; AX E, bill, dated November 1, 2018)  \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. She is current with her state and \nfederal taxes. She has no other debts than those listed on the SOR. (Tr. 31-32)  \n \nApplicant provided two letters of recommendation. Her present government \nsupervisor noted that Applicant has worked for her since 2009. Applicant\u2019s work has \nbeen consistent and without error. Her duties require a high level of confidentiality and \nfinancial oversight. She is entrusted with sensitive personnel information. Her supervisor \nis aware of Applicant\u2019s personal and family challenges. Applicant is not extravagant but \nis someone that is aiding a husband with a lifetime medical challenge. (AX F, Letter, \ndated November 5, 2018) \n \nThe second letter is from Applicant\u2019s immediate program manager and corporate \nsupervisor. He has known Applicant for four years. Applicant handles herself with \nprofessionalism, respect, and loyalty to the government client. She has proven herself \nworthy of having access to classified information. (AX G, Letter, dated October 31, \n2018).  \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n  5 \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations: \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations \nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. An individual \nwho is financially irresponsible, may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in \nhis obligations to protect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in \none aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects \nof life. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18).  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his or her creditors is a private matter until evidence \nis uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to meet financial obligations. \nAbsent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a \nhistory of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk inconsistent \nwith the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is required to manage his or her \nfinances in such a way as to meet financial obligations.  \n \nAdverse information in credit reports can normally meet the substantial evidence \nstandard to establish financial delinquency. A Credit report confirms the delinquent \ndebts listed in the SOR. This information is sufficient to raise security concerns under \nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19: \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts,  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and   \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nOnce the Government has established the adverse financial issue, the Applicant \nhas the responsibility to refute or mitigate the issue. Based on the information provided \n\n  6 \n \nby Applicant, I considered the following Financial Consideration Mitigating Conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible sources, such as a non-profit credit counselling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n \n(d) the individual has initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nThe mitigating conditions apply only in part and not to all the debts. Applicant\u2019s \ndebts are recent, numerous and not resolved. Applicant did not provide information \nconcerning financial counseling or participation in any debt-relief programs. Applicant\u2019s \ndebts may have been partially caused by her husband\u2019s illness that prevents him from \nworking and providing support to the family. Her husband is on disability and does not \nlive with her. She is raising their two children by herself. His condition and her lack of \nsupport from him is and will be recurring.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband\u2019s disability is a condition beyond her control, but her failure \nto pay her debts under her financial circumstances casts doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. She has not established that she acted responsibly \ntowards her debts under the circumstances. She has discretionary funds each month to \nuse for debt payments, but she has not provided information to show she is using the \nfunds to pay debts. She has car-loan debt that is not resolved because she failed to \nstay current with car payments when due. She did not provide documents to show she \nis making payments on another car loan that she cosigned. While she established that \ntwo communication service debts are current, she has not provided sufficient \ndocumentation to establish and verify that she paid utility and furniture debts. In other \n\n  7 \n \nwords, she has not established that she took reasonable and adequate action to resolve \nher debts when she had sufficient income. \n \n \nGood faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty and obligation. Applicant is not required to be debt-free \nnor must her plan require paying off all debts immediately or simultaneously. All that is \nrequired is that Applicant act responsibly given her circumstances. Applicant must \nestablish that she has a reasonable plan to resolve financial problems, and that she has \ntaken significant action to implement that plan. Applicant\u2019s plan must show a systematic \nmethod of handling debts, and Applicant must establish a meaningful track record of \ndebt payment. A promise to pay delinquent debts is not a substitute for a track record of \npaying debts in a timely manner and acting in a financially responsible manner.  \n \nApplicant did not provide information to establish that she resolved the debts \nalleged in the SOR except for the communication debts listed at SOR 1.c, and 1.f. \nApplicant did not present any information to establish that she has a plan indicating how \nshe will pay or resolve the remaining debts. Applicant has been gainfully employed \nsince at least 2009. Her income is significant and she seems to have sufficient income \nto make progress in resolving her delinquent debts. She has not presented any \nevidence of a budget and the state of her finances.  \n \nApplicant did not establish that she acted reasonably under the circumstances. \nExcept for the communication debts, Applicant presented no evidence of debt payments \nor resolution of other debts. She did not develop or present plans to pay her remaining \ndelinquent debts. She did not provide documentation to show continued payments of \nher debts or correspondence with creditors to establish she is in contact with them, \ncopies of debt disputes, evidence of attempts to negotiate payment plans, or other \nevidence of progress or resolution. There is no clear evidence that her debt problems \nhave been resolved, so her finances are not under control. There is insufficient \nevidence to establish why Applicant was unable to make greater progress resolving her \ndebts.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s ability to resolve her financial problems seem to be within her means \nand control. Since she did not present a plan to resolve her financial problems or make \nan effort to pay or resolve her delinquent debts, she has not established a good-faith \neffort to pay her debts. Her lack of reasonable and responsible actions towards her \nfinances is a strong indication that she will not protect and safeguard classified or \nsensitive information. Applicant did not present sufficient information to mitigate financial \nsecurity concerns. \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n\n  8 \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the letters of \nrecommendation from Applicant\u2019s supervisors. However, Applicant did not present \nsufficient and adequate evidence to establish that she took reasonable and responsible \naction to resolve her financial obligations. Applicant did not demonstrate appropriate \nmanagement of her finances and did not show a record of action to resolve financial \nissues. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts concerning \nApplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. She has not established her \nsuitability for access to classified information. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her financial situation. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d \u2013 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n\n  9 \n \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 54-year-old program lead/project manager who has served in the same capacity for over three-and-a-half years. She has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in project management, as well as a master\u2019s degree in project management and information technology. She also earned a second master\u2019s degree in cyber forensics. She is single and has no children. There is no evidence of formal financial counseling. From October 1985 to November 1989, Applicant served on active duty in the United States military. After a period of time as a reservist, she returned to active duty in early 1992, where she remained until retirement at the level of E-7 in November 2008. From that time until March 2013, she was employed by a defense contractor. From March 2013 until May 2014, Applicant was unemployed before accepting a brief temporary position in order to generate income. She was then intermittently unemployed from August 2014 to September 2015. Unemployed from October 2015 until December 2015, she accepted her present position at the end of 2015.

The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. \n \nIn a response notarized on November 13, 2018, Applicant admitted all \nallegations. She also requested a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) administrative judge. I was assigned the case on March 7, 2019.  \n \nOn June 5, 2018, a notice was issued setting the hearing for June 12, 2019. \nApplicant waived her right to 15 days notice and chose to proceed on the available date. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered five exhibits (Exs.), \nnoted as Exs. 1-5, and Applicant presented 12 documents, marked as Exs. A-L. With no \nobjections, all exhibits were accepted into the record. Applicant was granted through \nJune 24, 2019, to submit any additional materials. The transcript (Tr.) was received on \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nJune 25, 2019. After a request for an extension of time was granted, a final file of \nmaterials was offered by Applicant and admitted without objection as Exs. M-T on July \n9, 2019. The record was then closed. Based on the testimony, materials, and record as \na whole, I find Applicant mitigated security concerns. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old program lead/project manager who has served in the \nsame capacity for over three-and-a-half years. She has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nproject management, as well as a master\u2019s degree in project management and \ninformation technology. She also earned a second master\u2019s degree in cyber forensics. \nShe is single and has no children. There is no evidence of formal financial counseling. \n \n \nFrom October 1985 to November 1989, Applicant served on active duty in the \nUnited States military. After a period of time as a reservist, she returned to active duty in \nearly 1992, where she remained until retirement at the level of E-7 in November 2008. \nFrom that time until March 2013, she was employed by a defense contractor. From \nMarch 2013 until May 2014, Applicant was unemployed before accepting a brief \ntemporary position in order to generate income. She was then intermittently \nunemployed from August 2014 to September 2015. Unemployed from October 2015 \nuntil December 2015, she accepted her present position at the end of 2015.  (Tr. 57)  \n \n \nAt issue are six delinquent debts, five of which are related to federal or state \ntaxes. In both types of obligations, tax liabilities were acquired which Applicant had \ninsufficient income or resources to pay. (Tr. 34) Her federal tax issues are reflected in \nthe SOR at allegations 1.a ($11,554 November 2015 tax lien for tax year 2014 taxes \nowed), 1.b ($2,788 for related sums owed for tax year 2013), and 1.c ($10,598 for \nunpaid tax from tax year 2014).  \n \nApplicant began corresponding with the Government concerning her federal tax \nissues in 2015. (Tr. 51, 53) Other strides were made in 2016 and in 2017 to address her \nfederal tax obligations and work out a settlement or reduction. By August 2018, she \nstarted making arrangements to commence a comprehensive repayment agreement \nwith the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (Tr. 49, 51) The IRS dallied in arranging a \nrepayment terms. Applicant had no objection to the delays because she \u201cknew that if \n[she] started paying [the debt balance] back, the chances of them  offering any type of \nforgiveness of the early withdrawal fees, penalties, interest, and so on was nil, once \n[she] started paying.\u201d (Tr. 50, 53) Consequently, she did not push the issue because \nshe hoped her liability would be reduced to just the taxes originally owed. \n \nIn May 2019, she tried to contact the IRS by telephone \u201cto determine the status \n[of the debt] because she had not seen any correspondence\u201d in recent months \nconveying any information except the IRS needed more time to evaluate her situation. \n(Tr. 50) She then discovered that the case had been closed with no action by the IRS to \nreduce the amount owed, and that the matter had been transferred to collections. (Tr. \n50) Consequently, payment of $200 on an installment agreement with the IRS was \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nmade toward her 2013 tax balance on May 21, 2019, followed by another payment in \nearly June 2019. (Ex. C at 5)  \n \nApplicant showed all taxes owed for 2013 (1.b) have been paid and, at this point, \nshe has a credit of $420.22 on that account. (Ex. M at 2) However, a related lien (1.b) \n\u201cwill not be released now until ALL back taxes, penalties, and interest have been paid.\u201d \n(emphasis in the original) (Ex. J) As for the tax liabilities owed for tax year 2014 (1.c), its \nremaining balance, which includes accrued penalties and interest, is in repayment as \nper the payment plan implemented in May 2019 and referenced above. (Ex. M) \n \nApplicant also owed her state sums at SOR allegations 1.d ($3,766 for a tax lien \ndated March 2015) and 1.e ($3,598 for unpaid state taxes). She provided \ndocumentation showing that the lien at 1.d has been satisfied and released. (Ex. Q) She \nalso showed that a repayment plan on the debt noted at 1.e was initially implemented \naround September 2017, then a payment schedule was initiated. A new arrangement \nwas then established in August 2018. (Exs. R-S) Applicant showed she is currently in \ngood standing on that plan. (Ex. S) As of July 3, 2019, Applicant owed a balance of \nabout $812. (Ex. T) Applicant also provided a copy of a July 3, 2019, check dated July \n3, 2019, and made out for the sum of approximately $213 to be sent to her state \ncomptroller toward that balance. (Ex. T)  \n \n In addition, Applicant has a sixth delinquent debt at issue. It is for $232,919 and \nis related to student loans obtained between 2009 and 2017 (1.f). At the time of the \nOctober 4, 2018, SOR, they were noted as being in forbearance until approximately \nOctober 2018. Applicant finished her education in 2017. Payments were deferred during \nher enrollment. She then had them in forbearance due to her circumstances. (Tr. 55) \nApplicant showed that the related loans were subsequently taken out of forbearance \nand have been in timely repayment. (Ex. E at 14-24) She currently pays approximately \n$644 a month on the total balance due.  \n \nAt present, Applicant is generating sufficient income to meet her regular \nobligations while making strides on her tax and student loan obligations. She has a \nmonthly net remainder of about $940, which she puts into savings or into her budgeting \nfor future payments. (Tr. 59) She bought a new car in 2017 in order to replace an older \nmodel and secure safer travel for the approximately 94,000 miles she puts on her \nvehicle per year commuting. She uses credit cards less, and otherwise tends to \neconomize. Applicant recently sold a horse which had health issues, thus yielding her \nsavings from veterinary and other care. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \nnecessarily include consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nhas numerous delinquent debts. This is sufficient to invoke financial considerations \ndisqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do \nso;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations, and  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \nLacking disputes or evidence of financial counseling, three conditions could mitigate the \nfinance related security concerns posed here:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances, and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial distress began with a period of unemployment lasting from \nMarch 2013 to May 2014. She subsequently experienced other, shorter, periods of \nunemployment before starting her current work. The evidence shows her tax issues first \narose in tax year 2013. It also shows that she began working with federal and state tax \nauthorities by 2014. While she may have tarried as the IRS protracted reviewing her \nmaterials, a position she admits was designed to keep the possibility of reduced \npenalties open, it was not the result of inaction or obfuscation on her part. Ultimately, \nwhen she discovered the IRS had referred her case for collection, she assured \npayments were ready for deposit. Meanwhile, she satisfied her state tax obligation and \nis finishing her payment on the minor balance remaining for related fees. Meanwhile, \nshe kept her student loans in forbearance, as appropriate, until time for them to be \nsubject to payment. She proved that she has been and is presently in timely repayment \non her student loan debt. This is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(d).  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I \nam also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nApplicant is a 54-year-old program lead/project manager who has served in the \nsame capacity for over three years. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree and two master\u2019s \ndegrees related to her work specialty. Single and with no children, Applicant retired from \nthe U.S. military in 2008. When her first civilian position ended in 2013, she endured a \nlengthy period of unemployment, followed by a multiple periods of employment and \nunemployment, until beginning her present position at the end of 2015. \n \nThe evidence shows that while Applicant may have tarried in addressing her \nfederal and state tax issues, she did not delay in contacting them or working with them. \nIndeed, she admits she did not press the protracted efforts of the IRS in hopes that the \ndelay would yield some reduction in the amount she owed. All this occurred before the \nSOR was issued. Once advised her federal tax bill had been referred for collection, she \ndirectly started making payments on that debt. Evidence of her first two months of \npayments to the IRS, plus evidence of her success addressing her state tax balance \nand student loans, were apparent by the time of her hearing.  \n \nToday, Applicant\u2019s tax year 2013 balance is paid, and she is making regular \npayments to satisfy her much-reduced balance owed to the IRS. Her state tax liability is \nalso reduced to less than $1,000 and in repayment.  Her student loans are in timely \nrepayment. With economizing, she now has a considerable monthly net remainder to \nassure her ability to meet her monthly obligations. While financial counseling would \ngreatly benefit her given the fact she still uses credit cards, it is clear she has her \nfinances under control. Consequently, I find Applicant has mitigated financial \nconsiderations security concerns.  \n \n   Formal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n                       \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

Applicants for ADP positions are entitled to the procedural \nprotections in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination is made. \n(Under Secretary of Defense\u2019s Memorandum for the Director, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals, dated November 19, 2004)  \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nA public trust position decision resolves whether it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to sensitive \ninformation. The Government must prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts \nalleged in the SOR. If it does, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. The applicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant \nor continue his or her access to sensitive information.  \n \nPersons with access to sensitive information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling \ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness of those who must protect national security as their own. The \u201cclearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security\u201d standard requires that \u201cany doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). An eligibility for a public trust position decision \nis not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. It is merely an indication \nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established \nfor issuing access to sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this guideline \nis that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts and both Federal and state tax-related \nliens. This is sufficient to invoke financial considerations disqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do \nso;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax a required.  \n \nFive conditions could mitigate the finance related security concerns posed:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAs a threshold issue, it is noted that Applicant\u2019s second husband had business \nproblems that seem to have adversely affected Applicant\u2019s finances. It is also noted that \nmultiple debts were incurred because Applicant lacked medical insurance. However, \ninsufficient information and documentary evidence was introduced to show she acted \nresponsibly at the time the debts were incurred. At best, AG \u00b6 20(b) applies in part \nregarding the creation of the debts at issue.  \n \nThere is documentary evidence reflecting attempts to address those debts over a \nthree-year period. Between 2016 and 2018, Applicant addressed in varying degrees the \ndelinquent debts at 1.a, 1.b, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j., 1.m, and 1.p. She also instituted a repayment \nplan for the state lien obligations noted at 1.c-1.d. The rest, including about $35,000 in \nunaddressed federal tax liens, either remain unpaid or lack documentary evidence \nreflecting effort on the part of Applicant. Applicant\u2019s current financial condition is unclear, \nbut it is shown that the IRS determined Applicant is presently unable to make payments \non her tax balance. Further, there is no documentary evidence reflecting she has received \nfinancial counseling. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to surmise that Applicant is \nadhering to a holistic debt resolution or financial rehabilitation plan, has her debts \ncurrently under control, or has the present ability to do more to address her delinquent \nobligations. At best, I find AG \u00b6 20(d) applies in part. Lacking evidence of financial \ncounseling or that Applicant is adhering to an organized plan for addressing the debts at \nissue, none of the other conditions apply.  \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nadjudicative process factors listed in the AG. Under AG \u00b6 2(a), the need to utilize a \u201cwhole-\nperson\u201d evaluation is set forth. I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I incorporated \nmy comments under the guideline at issue in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old administrative assistant and consultant. She is the \nmarried mother of four adult children and two adult stepchildren. At issue are 16 \ndelinquent debts totaling $80,377. Of that sum, Applicant has shown progress or payment \non nearly half of the debts in the past three years. State tax obligations in the amount of \nabout $52,000 from about a decade ago are now in repayment with highly reasonable \nmonthly payments of less than $500.  \n \nWhat remains worrisome is how Applicant is to proceed with the rest of her \ndelinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s present finances and ability to make payment toward old \ndebts is unclear. Her delinquent obligations include a debt to the IRS for over $40,000 \nupon which the IRS states she cannot at presently pay. Applicant failed to describe her \nmethodology or approach for addressing her debts in the past, and no strategy is \nexpressed for resolving her remaining outstanding accounts in the future. This process \ndoes not expect an applicant to satisfy or address all of her obligations; indeed, \nApplicant\u2019s demonstrated progress is commended. What is needed, however, is some \ndescription of a coherent and appropriate plan to address the remaining debts at issue \ngoing forward. Without such a scheme, her likelihood of success cannot be surmised. In \nlight of the foregoing, I find that Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.g: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs1.h-1.j: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k-1.l: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.n-1.o: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \n \n \n \n \n \n        Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

(e-\nQIP)  On April 23, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases after June \n8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 22, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on April \n30, 2019.  The case was reassigned to me on June 18, 2019.  The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on May 6, 2019, and the hearing was \nconvened as scheduled on June 24, 2019. The Government offered nine exhibits, \n\n \n2 \n \nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 9, which were admitted without objection. \nThe Applicant offered fourteen exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through N, \nwhich were admitted without objection.  Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record \nremained open until close of business on July 1, 2019, to allow the Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional supporting documentation.  Applicant submitted one \nPost-Hearing Exhibit, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A, which was \nadmitted without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 8, \n2019. \n \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 31 years old.  He is unmarried.  He has a Bachelor\u2019s degree.  He \nholds the position of Custodial Clean Room Attendant with a defense contractor.  He \nseeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense \nindustry.  He has never held a security clearance before.  \n \nParagraph 1 Guideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations   The Government alleges that the \nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of \nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to six separate creditors totaling \napproximately $15,000 in debts, and $12,000 in traffic fines owed to a state for a total of \n$27,000.  In his Answer, Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR.  \nCredit reports of the Applicant dated September 22, 2016; December 1, 2018; and \nOctober 11, 2018, reflect that each of these debts were owing at one point.  \n(Government Exhibits 3, 4 and 5.)       \n \n \nApplicant admits that he made many poor decisions, financial and other wise, as \na teenager and young adult.  He hung around the wrong group of people and got \nhimself into a lot of trouble with the law.  In 2009, when he was charged with Burglary, \nhe went to jail for two days and realized that he needed to change his life before it was \ntoo late.  Since then Applicant has been working to improve himself and to show \nresponsibility and good judgment.   \n \n \nApplicant lives with his parents.  He pays rent of $600 monthly to his parents.  He \nalso makes his car payments of $335 each month on time, his cell phone bill of $120 a \nmonth, and pays his insurance on a regular basis.  Applicant explained that his financial \nproblems began when, as a full-time student, he was in a motorcycle accident and had \nthree broken bones.  He was taken to the emergency room with no medical insurance.  \nHe was billed accordingly.  Applicant was unaware that he could have qualified for \nemergency care or Medi-Cal.  As a result of this accident, Applicant fell behind on \nseveral of the debts listed in the SOR.   \n \n \nIn July 2017, Applicant began working for his current employer.  He enjoys his \nwork and is well liked.  He currently bring home between $3,000 and $3,200 a month.  \nSince 2017, he has been working diligently to resolve his delinquent debt.  He borrowed \n\n \n3 \n \nsome money from his mother to resolve his delinquent medical debts and has already \nrepaid her with his refunds from his income tax returns. \n \n \nThe following delinquent debts listed in the SOR became owing and are now paid \noff in full, or are being paid in regular systematic monthly payments. \n \n1.a. Applicant was indebted to a creditor for an account placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $2,477.  This was for his bail bond.  Applicant has paid the debt \noff in full. (Tr. pp. 38-39 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H.)             \n \n1.b.  Applicant was indebted to a creditor for a medical account that was placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $90.  This was a medical bill from the \nmotorcycle accident.  Applicant has paid the debt off in full.  (Tr. p. 39 and Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit I.) \n \n1.c.   Applicant was indebted to a creditor for a medical account placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $4,771.  This was a medical bill from the motorcycle \naccident.  Applicant has paid the debt off in full.  (Tr. p. 40 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J.)          \n \n1.d.  Applicant was indebted to a creditor for a medical account that was placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $5,260.  This was a medical bill form the \nmotorcycle accident.  Applicant has paid the debt off in full.  (Tr. p. 40 and Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit K.) \n \n1.e.  Applicant was indebted to a state for traffic fines assessed against him in 2014 for \nan account that was placed for collection in the approximate amount of $1,260.  This \nwas for unpaid traffic tickets and interest.  Applicant has paid the debt off in full.  (Tr. p. \n41 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit M.)           \n \n1.f.  Applicant was indebted to a state for traffic fines assessed against him in 2017 in \nthe approximate amount of $878.  This was for unpaid traffic tickets and interest.  \nApplicant has paid the debt off in full.  (Tr. p. 41 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit M.)   \n             \nParagraph 2 Guideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct   The Government alleges that the \nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal activity that creates \ndoubt about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \n \n \nApplicant also engaged in a litany of criminal activity over the past fifteen years.  \nHe has no excuses for this misconduct.  He was simply immature and irresponsible.  \n(Government Exhibits 6, 7 and 8.)  \n \n2.a.  In June 2001, Applicant was charged with Drunk in Public.  Applicant denies this \nincident.  He was only in junior high school at the time.  (Tr. pp. 44 - 45.)  This allegation \nis found for the Applicant.   \n \n2.b.  In December 2002, Applicant was charged with Speeding and Driving While on a \nSuspended License.  Applicant denies this incident.  Applicant was not old enough at \n\n \n4 \n \nthis time to possess a driver\u2019s license.  (Tr. p. 45.)  This allegation is found for the \nApplicant.   \n \n2.c.  In about November 2005, Applicant was charged with Driving While on a \nSuspended License.  Applicant denies the incident.  He did not receive a Driver\u2019s \nLicense until he was eighteen years old in 2010.  (Tr. p. 46)  This allegation is found for \nthe Applicant. \n \n2.d.  In about June 2006, Applicant was charged with Possession of Marijuana.  \nApplicant admits the incident.  Applicant admits that he was cruising in a car with some \nfriends when he had marijuana in his possession.  He was pulled over by the police and \ncited.  (Tr. p. 47-48.)    \n \n2.e.  In about June 2009, Applicant was charged with Speeding, Failure to Appear and \nFailure to Pay.  Applicant admits that he was speeding and he did not have the money \nto pay the fines.  (Tr. p. 49.)   \n \n2.f.  In about September 2009, Applicant was charged with Speeding and Possession of \nMarijuana.  Applicant does not remember the specifics but admits that during this time \nin his life he engaged in such conduct.  (Tr. p. 50.)   \n \n2.g.  In about October 2009, Applicant was charged with Burglary, Selling Marijuana, \nand Driving Without a License.  Applicant explained that when he was arrested he had \n$600 in his pocket because he had just been paid at work where he cleaned carpets.  \nHe was arrested for burglary because he and his friends were breaking into cars.  As a \nresult of this offense, Applicant served two days in jail.  (Tr. pp. 51-54.)           \n \n2.h.  In about June 2012, Applicant was charged with Speeding.  Applicant explained \nthat he was driving 90 miles an hour, about 10 miles over the speed limit, when he was \npulled over.  His driver\u2019s license was suspended.  (Tr. p. 55.)   \n \n21.i.  In about September 2012, Applicant was charged with Speeding and Driving on a \nSuspended License.  At the time, Applicant was going to school and working and chose \nto drive on a suspended license.  (Tr. pp. 55-57.)     \n \n2.j.  In about October 2013, Applicant was charged with Driving Without a License.  \nApplicant stated that he lost his license due to the number of speeding violations he \nhad.  He currently has a valid driver\u2019s license.  He has not had a traffic violation of any \nsort for the past five years.  (Tr. pp. 58.)   \n \n2.k.  In about January 2014, Applicant was charged with Driving with a Suspended \nLicense and Driving an Unregistered Vehicle.  Applicant believes that he was initially \npulled over for having dark tint on his front seat windows and cited.  (Tr. pp. 59-60)     \n \n2.l.  In April 2017, Applicant was charged with Failure to Provide a Child Restraint, \nFailure to Appear.  Applicant denies this allegation as he states that this has never \noccurred.  (Tr. p. 60.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant credibly expressed that since 2014 his life has changed for the better.  \nHe has really grown up and moved forward in a positive direction by adhering to rules \nand regulations and overall being a more responsible individual. \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n6 \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information.  Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.  An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;    \n \n(b)  unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do do; and    \n \n \n(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has experienced financial hardship due to an unexpected motorcycle \naccident where he needed emergency medical care and had no insurance.  He was \nalso financially irresponsible.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n \n \nFour Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved  or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nSince June 2017, Applicant has been working hard to pay off his delinquent debt.  \nHe has paid off all of the debt listed in the SOR.  Applicant clearly understands the \nresponsibilities that come along with possessing a security clearance.  He has \ndemonstrated financial responsibility by resolving his delinquent indebtedness.  He has \nacted maturely, reasonably and responsibly, and has demonstrated good judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness.  The Financial Considerations concern has been \nmitigated.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to , a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n \nApplicant engaged in a number of criminal activities as a young adult that \nresulted in him being charged, convicted, fined and even sentenced to jail.  The \naforementioned disqualifying conditions have been established.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFour Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant has been a nuisance for many years.  He simply disregarded many of \nthe laws of our society.  He did whatever he wanted to do at the time without regard for \nthe consequences.  This shows extreme poor judgment.  Until he spent time in jail, he \ndid not absorb the seriousness of his actions.  His experience in jail in 2009, whatever it \nwas, made a dramatic impact on him, and helped him to want to be a better person and \nlive a better life.  Although he continued to violate some traffic laws after that, he did not \nengage in any other criminal activity.  Five years has now passed without a violation of \nthe law in any form or fashion.  Applicant understands that if he is to possess a security \nclearance he must demonstrate that he is a mature individual who consistently follows \nall rules and regulations.  Applicant looks to be a changed man.  At this time, he has \ndemonstrated sufficient evidence of rehabilitation.  AG \u00b6 32(a) and (d) are applicable \nand provide full mitigation.  In the event that Applicant makes poor decisions in the \nfuture and deviates from this positive path, his security clearance will be in immediate \njeopardy. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n9 \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and J in my whole-person analysis.  Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nFinancial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.: through 1.f.:  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J : \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.: through 1.l  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) assigned the case to another administrative judge on August 3, 2018, \nand reassigned it me on October 3, 2018. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October \n18, 2018, setting the hearing for November 7, 2018. Department Counsel offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 into evidence. All exhibits were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified but did not offer any exhibits. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on November 16, 2018.

His admissions are incorporated into these findings. \n \n \nApplicant is 27 years old and recently engaged. After graduating from high school \nin 2009, he enlisted in the U.S. Army. He served on active duty for four years and in the \nArmy Reserve for one year, until 2014, when he was honorably discharged as an E-4. \nWhile serving, he deployed to the Middle East from July 2012 to April 2013. He received \na Purple Heart, a Good Conduct Medal, and an Army Commendation Medal during his \nservice. He was granted a Top Secret security clearance in 2009 after entering the Army. \nAfter leaving the Army, he attended college fulltime from 2013 to 2014. (Tr. 15-18, 21, 23)  \n \n \nAfter college, Applicant worked in private industry. In May 2015, he started his \ncurrent position with a defense contractor. His performance evaluations have been good \nand resulted in merit pay increases. His fianc\u00e9 is aware of this proceeding and the \nunderlying security concerns. (Tr. 18-20) \n \n \nIn April 2015, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). In it, he \ndisclosed that he had used marijuana and cocaine. (GE 2) During an investigative \ninterview in October 2016, he discussed more fully his illegal drug use. While testifying \nhe stated that he used marijuana less than five times prior to joining the Army in 2009. \nWhile on active duty, he used marijuana once in September 2012 after he was injured \nand lost two friends in combat. (Tr. 21-23; GE 4)  \n \n \nAfter leaving military service, Applicant started working as an electrician for a \nprivate company for about 18 months. Between November 2014 and January 2015, he \nused marijuana about 15 times and then stopped. (Tr. 22) \n \n \nApplicant used cocaine for the first time in May 2012 while he was in Italy and prior \nto deployment. He was with other soldiers at the time. He then used cocaine between five \nand ten times while deployed to the Middle East. He was a machine gunner and ingested \nit to stay awake during long combat missions. He obtained the drugs from a local citizen. \n(Tr. 25-26) \n \n \nWhile in the Middle East, Applicant also purchased and used anabolic steroids for \none month. He has not used any other illegal substances and has no intention to use \nthem in the future. (Tr. 30, 43) \n \n \nApplicant denied that he used cocaine after submitting his April 2015 SCA, \nalthough he stated that he had during his interview. He said that he was confused about \ndates of his usage, but was certain that he did not use illegal substances months before \nstarting his current job in April 2015. (Tr. 29-29) \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nApplicant has changed his life since leaving military service. He is engaged and \npurchased a home. He no longer associates with people who use drugs. He spends time \nwith his family and is involved in community outreach programs. He has never tested \npositive for drugs. (Tr. 30-31) \n \n \nApplicant explained that he also used cocaine to help medicate his post-traumatic \nstress disorder (PTSD) that he began suffering during service. After returning to the \nUnited States from his deployment, he saw a therapist once in 2013. In 2014, he started \nattending a group for veterans who have PTSD that met on his college campus. He went \nto the group weekly for two months. He stopped when he left college. In February 2016, \nhe started seeing a psychiatrist who prescribed an antidepressant for PTSD. He took the \nmedication for about eight months and then stopped. In October 2017, he saw his primary \ncare physician who recommended that he resume taking an antidepressant, which he \nhas been doing. He also stays in contact with a person he met at the group therapy \nmeetings for support. (Tr. 32-40)   \n \n \nApplicant submitted two letters of recommendation. Applicant\u2019s former \nCommander for two years wrote that Applicant \u201cwas an exceptional performer . . . a great \nteammate, and served his country honorably.\u201d (AE A) Based on his observation of \nApplicant during combat, he has no reservations about Applicant\u2019s ability to handle \nsensitive information. (AE A) A soldier, who served with Applicant, stated that Applicant \n\u201cwas a charismatic, dependable, and hard worker, even when faced with adverse \ncondition.\u201d (AE B) \n \n \nApplicant provided performance evaluations from 2016 and 2017. They document \nhis successful work, potential, and good attitude. (AE C, D, E, F) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which were effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(c) describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 says that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concern involving drug involvement and substance \nmisuse as follows: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \n\n \n \n \n \n5\ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 sets out conditions that could raise a security concern. Three may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \nApplicant admitted that he illegally purchased and used marijuana, cocaine, and \nanabolic steroids periodically from October 2007 to January 2015. Some of that time, he \nheld a security clearance. The evidence established the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nConditions that could mitigate drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns are provided in AG \u00b6 26. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \n \nThe last time Applicant used an illegal substance, marijuana, was in January 2015, \nprior to submitting his April 2015 SCA. He used marijuana once while he was deployed \nto a combat zone after being injured and losing friends. He also used cocaine and \nanabolic steroids during the deployment from 2012 to 2013. He used cocaine to stay \nawake while on missions. His last usage occurred over three years ago and does not cast \n\n \n \n \n \n6\ndoubt on his current trustworthiness. The evidence establishes mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n26(a).  \n \nApplicant acknowledged his past drug involvement and substance misuse. In early \n2016, he received treatment and medication for PTSD, an underlying cause of his drug \nuse. Since October 2017, he has been under the care of his primary care physician for \nhis medical issues and has continued to take appropriate medication, as prescribed. He \nno longer associates with people who use illegal drugs and has changed his priorities. He \nemphasized that he has no intention to use illegal drugs in the future, but he did not sign \na statement confirming his intention. The evidence establishes partial mitigation under \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b)(1) and (2), but not under AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nAfter observing Applicant\u2019s demeanor and listening to his testimony, I found him \ncandid and honest. He disclosed his illegal drug use in his 2015 SCA. While not \ncondoning his previous drug abuse, he explained that a significant portion of it occurred \nwhile deployed to a combat zone. He is now engaged and purchased a house. He is \naddressing his PTSD. He understands the ramifications that future drug misuse could \nhave on his employment. Given these factors, letters of recommendation from two \nindividuals with whom he served, and the fact that he voluntarily stopped using all illegal \ndrugs in January 2015, I do not believe that he will engage in similar conduct in the future. \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nOverall, the record no longer raises doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n     Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \n     For Applicant \n \n \n      \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to continue Applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 68 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1973, and a master\u2019s degree in 1978. He married in 1973 and adopted two children, now adults, from his wife\u2019s previous marriage. They also have an adult child from their union. One of his adult children has special needs. Applicant served in the U.S. Army for 22 years in the Air Defense Artillery, including multiple overseas deployments. He retired in 1996 at the rank of lieutenant colonel. Immediately after his retirement, he was employed by a DOD contractor. He has worked for this DOD contractor for nearly 23 years. He currently possesses a DOD security clearance. Applicant has received several certificates, letters of appreciation, and favorable employee evaluations during the course of his employment. (Tr. 21-25; GE 1; AE H, AE I, AE J) SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that in February 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with four counts of felony theft for stealing luggage from the local airport between November 2013 and February 2014. Applicant admitted this allegation in his response to the SOR. During the hearing, Applicant admitted his arrest but denied stealing any bags. He mistakenly took a bag in the local airport on the day of his arrest, but it was never his intent to steal it.

His criminal conduct casts doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. National security eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied.  \n \n \n \n \n \n Statement of the Case \n \n \nOn April 20, 2015, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). \nOn August 20, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guidelines J and E. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.    \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 29, 2018. He admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a, but \nhe failed to admit or deny SOR \u00b6 2.a, which was a cross-reference to SOR \u00b6 1.a. I have \n\n \n2 \n \n \ninterpreted this omission as a denial by Applicant. He requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. On December 31, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for January 16, 2019. \nOn January 4, 2019, the case was assigned to me. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibit (GE) 1-7, \nwhich I admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibit \n(AE) A-J, which I entered into evidence without objection. (Tr. 26-32) Applicant testified, \nand I held the record open until February 16, 2019, in the event either party wanted to \nsubmit additional documentation. On February 3, 2019, Applicant provided two \nadditional documents. I admitted AE K and L into evidence without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 25, 2019, and the record was closed on \nFebruary 16, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following \nfindings of fact:  Applicant is 68 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1973, and \na master\u2019s degree in 1978. He married in 1973 and adopted two children, now adults, \nfrom his wife\u2019s previous marriage. They also have an adult child from their union. One of \nhis adult children has special needs. Applicant served in the U.S. Army for 22 years in \nthe Air Defense Artillery, including multiple overseas deployments. He retired in 1996 at \nthe rank of lieutenant colonel. Immediately after his retirement, he was employed by a \nDOD contractor. He has worked for this DOD contractor for nearly 23 years. He \ncurrently possesses a DOD security clearance. Applicant has received several \ncertificates, letters of appreciation, and favorable employee evaluations during the \ncourse of his employment. (Tr. 21-25; GE 1; AE H, AE I, AE J) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that in February 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith four counts of felony theft for stealing luggage from the local airport between \nNovember 2013 and February 2014. Applicant admitted this allegation in his response \nto the SOR. During the hearing, Applicant admitted his arrest but denied stealing any \nbags. He mistakenly took a bag in the local airport on the day of his arrest, but it was \nnever his intent to steal it. He claimed the other three pieces of stolen luggage he was \ncharged with did not involve him. (Tr. 26) \n \nIn December 2015, Applicant participated in a background interview with an \nauthorized DOD investigator. When questioned about his February 4, 2014 arrest, \nApplicant stated that he flew into the local airport of State A for a work assignment. He \ntook his two checked bags from the luggage carousel and left the airport. He soon \nrealized he forgot to retrieve a carry-on bag that he was unable to fit in the overhead \ncompartment when he boarded the airplane. He stated this bag had been checked with \nthe airplane\u2019s cargo. He did not receive a claim tag for this bag. Applicant called the \nairline to see if his bag was at the airport. The airline had difficulties tracking his bag \nsince he did not check it in at the airline counter and the bag was never tagged with a \nclaim tag. (Emphasis added) A couple days later the airline called him to report several \n\n \n3 \n \n \nunclaimed bags had arrived and requested Applicant to come to the airport to see if one \nof the bags belonged to him. (Tr. 48; GE 2)  \n \nDuring the background interview, Applicant told the investigator that he arrived at \nthe airport at approximately 6:00 p.m. He came in from the outside door near the \nluggage area and found what he thought was his bag and walked away. He was \nstopped by the police and questioned about the bag in his possession. He told the \nofficer it was his bag, but after further examination, it was determined to be another \nindividual\u2019s bag. He is legally blind in his right eye and believed this contributed to him \npicking up the wrong bag. He was taken by the police to a holding room for questioning. \nApplicant had flown into this airport on countless occasions for his employer. Police \nreviewed security tapes and matched him with three other earlier incidents where \nluggage had been stolen from the airport. In addition, police noted that on each of these \noccasions, the suspected thief had come from the outside door to the luggage area with \na luggage cart instead of coming directly from the flight arrival gate. The police obtained \na search warrant of his hotel room, but they did not find any incriminating evidence. \nDespite the search warrant result and Applicant\u2019s explanations, the police charged him \nwith four felony counts of theft. (GE 2) \n \nApplicant hired a local attorney. He did not want to plead guilty to the charges as \nhe was \u201cin no way involved in the theft of luggage.\u201d His attorney advised him that if he \ndid go to trial, Applicant would have to pay him an additional $10,0001 in legal fees, and \nhe also indicated the case could drag out for two years or longer. The state\u2019s attorney \noffered a plea bargain. The agreement included conditions that Applicant pay the airline \nrestitution in the approximate amount of $3,000, and perform 24 hours of community \nservice. After he fulfilled the terms of the agreement, the court would place the charges \non the Stet docket. If Applicant did not accept the plea bargain, the DA would proceed \nwith the criminal trial. Since Applicant claimed this was the most cost-effective and \nexpedient way to handle the situation, he accepted the plea bargain and fulfilled the \nspecified conditions. (Tr. 38, 58; GE 2) \n \nThe police records showed the airline reported a suitcase was stolen on \nNovember 17, 2013. The detective reviewed video footage of the luggage area which \nshowed a white male removing the bag and leaving the terminal. Another theft occurred \non November 19, 2013. The same white male was witnessed on the video footage, \nabout 50 years old, wearing dark colored shoes, light jeans, and a dark colored waist \nlength jacket, taking a blue suitcase that was reported as stolen. The surveillance \nfootage showed that on both occasions, the male suspect did not walk to the baggage \nclaim from the airline gate. Instead, the male suspect entered the baggage claim area \nfrom the outside door with a luggage cart to retrieve the suitcases. The police placed a \nbulletin of the male suspect\u2019s photo for the airline employees to call police if he was \nseen in the baggage area. There were no thefts of luggage reported from November 21, \n2013 through February 1, 2014. (GE 5) \n \n                                                          \n1 Applicant later said he had paid $7,000 for his attorney, and if he went to trial, he would have to pay an \nadditional $13,000-$15,000. (Tr. 58) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nOn approximately February 2, 2014, an airline representative notified a police \ndetective that a bag was stolen from the baggage carousel. The surveillance video \nshowed the same male suspect that was posted on the November 2013 bulletin. On this \ndate, he was wearing a dark blue peacoat and blue jeans. On February 4, 2014, an \nairline employee called a police detective to report that the male suspect from the \nbulletin was back at the baggage area, wearing a blue coat and blue jeans. At \napproximately 2:00 p.m., the detective located the male suspect in the hourly garage, \nwith a luggage cart that had a black Samsonite roller suitcase, without a claim tag. The \nmale suspect told the detective that he flew in yesterday and had returned to the airport \nto claim his lost bag. (Tr. 52; GE 5) \n \nWhile the detective was talking with Applicant, a phone call came in that a \npassenger could not locate his black roller suitcase, and he told the airline his name \ncard was located on the outside of the bag. The detective inspected the roller suitcase \nthat was on Applicant\u2019s luggage cart which showed the victim\u2019s name card on the \noutside of the bag. The police found the victim\u2019s airline claim tag in a trash can inside \nthe hourly garage. Applicant was apprehended by the police for questioning. After \nreviewing Applicant\u2019s travel itinerary, the police discovered Applicant had been in State \nA during the two incidents of luggage theft in November 2014, and the earlier incident of \nluggage theft on February 2, 2014. Applicant was charged with four felony counts of \ntheft. (Tr. 52; GE 5)  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant was asked about the circumstances which led to his \narrest. On February 2, 2014, Applicant carried his bag, filled with books, when he \nboarded the airplane. It would not fit in the overhead compartment, and the airline \nattendant checked his bag without placing an airline claim tag on it. When he exited the \nairplane, Applicant assumed his bag would be in the aisle, but it was not there. He \nasked the flight attendant about the checked bag, and he was informed that his bag \nwould be located at the baggage claim. He also explained that he never carries his bags \nfor two reasons: (1) he has a bad back, and on the day of his arrest, (2) his lost carry-on \nbag was filled with books, so it was heavy.2 Applicant found his two checked suitcases, \nbut his carry-on bag was not there. He reported his bag missing to the airline and \nprovided his phone number. Since his bag had not been tagged, the airline could not \ntrack it. He was told that his bag may arrive on a later flight, and they would give him a \ncall. On the day of his arrest, he claimed he received a call from the airline letting him \nknow his bag may be there, but they did not know for certain since his bag was not \ntagged. (Emphasis added) (Tr. 26-30, 32, 35) \n \n  \nApplicant believed he was identified on the video footage near the baggage claim \non dates he did not fly on the airline, which also included some of the dates the \nsuitcases were stolen, because he had visited the USO in the airport to acquire free \ndrinks, snacks, and he enjoyed talking with families. He did not provide any USO sign-in \nsheets to corroborate his claim. On the day of his arrest, Applicant admitted he had \n                                                          \n2 Although Applicant carried his heavy bag filled with books when he boarded the airplane on February 2, \n2014. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nremoved the airline tag from the suitcase. Applicant described himself as being a little \nobsessive.  Whenever he retrieves his suitcase, he immediately rips off all of the tags \nand throws them away. This always has been his consistent habit when traveling. \nApplicant did not provide any witness statements to corroborate his claim. (Tr. 39-41, \n53, 60-61) \n \nApplicant\u2019s salary with his current employer is approximately $260,000. He was \nasked why, with his significant income, he would not pay the additional money to his \nattorney to fight the felony theft charges that were filed against him. Applicant claimed \nthat his income in 2014 was significantly lower, about $140,000 to $150,000. (Emphasis \nadded) When questioned about this substantial difference in salary from the same \nemployer, Applicant said it was due to him not receiving bonuses in 2014. He then \nstated that his decision to accept the plea bargain was not fully financially based. He \nalso consulted with his lawyer, family, and after management\u2019s assertion that his \nacceptance of the plea bargain would not hurt him in any way, he took the deal. I \nrequested Applicant provide a copy of his filed 2014 tax return while the record was held \nopen for 30 days. The requested 2014 tax return was provided on February 3, 2019. It \nshowed, in part, that Applicant\u2019s annual income was $233,424, plus taking into account \nhis annual pensions and annuities of $52,817, he had a combined total income of \n$287,466 for 2014. (Emphasis added) (Tr. 63-66; AE K, AE L) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J; Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31, and the following is \npotentially applicable: \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n \nIn February 2014, Appellant was arrested on four felony counts of theft. He \naccepted a plea bargain and paid approximately $3,000 restitution to the airline, and \nperformed 24 hours of community service. The court placed the charges on the Stet \ndocket. The charges were not dismissed for lack of evidence. If Applicant had not \nfulfilled the conditions of the plea bargain, the DA made it clear they would continue with \nprosecution of the case against him. The above disqualifying condition applies. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nAppellant\u2019s charges of felony theft were based on two thefts of luggage in late \nNovember 2013 and two thefts in February 2014. After the two thefts in November, the \npolice made a bulletin with the male suspect\u2019s picture taken from the surveillance \nfootage. The police asked the airline employees to call police if the suspect was seen in \nthe airport. A diligent airline employee saw the male suspect from the bulletin photo and \nimmediately called the police. The suspect spotted near the baggage claim area turned \nout to be Applicant. He had entered from the outside door with a luggage cart to retrieve \na bag, just as the suspect did in the three earlier thefts. While returning to his car, \nApplicant removed the tags from the suitcase and threw them into the trash can. \nApplicant claimed it was a fluke that he was in possession of another individual\u2019s bag at \nthe time the detective stopped to question him. \n \n \nApplicant did not provide truthful information when he was questioned about his \n2014 income. He claimed he made approximately $145,000 due to him not receiving \nemployment bonuses that year. A copy of his 2014 tax return showed that his income \nwas almost double the amount he reported. It is important to note, however, that \nApplicant consistently reported that his lost carry-on bag did not have an airline tracking \ntag on it. The day he arrived at the airport to look for his lost bag, Applicant took a \nsuitcase that had an airline tracking tag on it. The tag should have put him on notice that \nthis was not his bag, or at the very least, he should have taken a closer examination of \nthe bag since a name card was located on the outside of the suitcase. Applicant did not \nwork with an airline representative to claim his lost carry-on bag.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s travel itinerary showed he was in the area when the three earlier \nthefts occurred. The video footage also showed him in the airport on days he was not \ntraveling on an airplane. Applicant claimed he would go to the airport\u2019s USO for free \ndrinks and snacks. When Applicant was stopped by the detective after an airline \nemployee recognized the suspect from the bulletin, Applicant just happened to be in \n\n \n8 \n \n \npossession of a suitcase that was reported missing. I find this an unlikely coincidence. \nApplicant\u2019s explanations are not credible or corroborated. His criminal conduct casts \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. His failure to accept \nresponsibility or express any remorse for his misconduct demonstrates that he has not \nbeen successfully rehabilitated. The above mitigating conditions do not apply. \n  \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative \nor adjudicative processes. \u2026 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable under the established facts in \nthis case: \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. \nSuch conduct includes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct was addressed under that specific guideline. The \nsame issue was cross-alleged under the personal conduct guideline. No specific \npersonal conduct allegations were raised beyond what was raised under the appropriate \nguideline. I have previously addressed the issue under Guideline J.  \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such \nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n (d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \n\n \n9 \n \n \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nApplicant has consistently denied that he stole suitcases from an airport when he \nwas on travel for his employer. Having determined that his explanations were not \ncredible or corroborated, the evidence supports he engaged in criminal conduct, and his \npersonal conduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and overall good \njudgment. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \n  \n \n \n \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. This SOR highlights serious offenses that provide \ninsight to a person\u2019s character and integrity. Applicant has not accepted responsibility \nfor his misconduct, nor has he expressed any remorse for his deceit. I conclude that \nApplicant has not mitigated security concerns raised by his criminal conduct and \npersonal conduct. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n      AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n       \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n      AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n       \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                \n \n \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the four financial allegations contained in the SOR. He denied the personal conduct allegation. He provided some explanations. (Item 2) Applicant is 44 years old, married, and has three children, ages 22, 19, and 1 . He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1996. In July 2016, he began a position with a defense contractor and works overseas. Prior to this position, he owned a martial arts business for many years and periodically worked for other companies. (Item 3) In February 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). Under Section 26: Financial Record, which inquired into his financial history, he did not disclose any financial delinquencies, tax liens, or automobile repossessions. (Item 3) During an October 2017 background interview with a government investigator, he was confronted with information about two tax liens, an automobile repossession, and a 2008 bankruptcy. Applicant stated that he failed to list the 2014 tax lien due to an oversight. He told the investigator he did not intend to mislead the Government about the information. He said his wife, a lawyer, manages their finances, implying that he is not involved in them.

He did not disclose \nrequired financial information in his security clearance application. He failed to mitigate \nthe resulting financial and personal conduct security concerns. National security eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 22, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \n03/11/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 1, 2018, and requested that his \ncase be decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing \n(Answer). On June 21, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing eight Items, \nwas mailed to Applicant and received by him on July 8, 2018. The FORM notified \nApplicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant did not submit \nany additional information, refutation, or objections to the Government\u2019s evidence. Items \n1 through 8 are admitted into evidence. DOHA assigned the case to me on February 14, \n2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the four financial allegations contained in the SOR. He denied \nthe personal conduct allegation. He provided some explanations. (Item 2) \n \n \nApplicant is 44 years old, married, and has three children, ages 22, 19, and 1 . He \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1996. In July 2016, he began a position with a defense \ncontractor and works overseas. Prior to this position, he owned a martial arts business \nfor many years and periodically worked for other companies. (Item 3) \n \n \nIn February 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). \nUnder Section 26: Financial Record, which inquired into his financial history, he did not \ndisclose any financial delinquencies, tax liens, or automobile repossessions. (Item 3) \nDuring an October 2017 background interview with a government investigator, he was \nconfronted with information about two tax liens, an automobile repossession, and a 2008 \nbankruptcy. Applicant stated that he failed to list the 2014 tax lien due to an oversight. He \ntold the investigator he did not intend to mislead the Government about the information. \nHe said his wife, a lawyer, manages their finances, implying that he is not involved in \nthem. He said he was not required to disclose the 2008 bankruptcy because it was outside \nthe time limit of the question. Although the automobile repossession account was not \ncharged off until May 2016, which was after he submitted his SCA, the related delinquent \nloan payments and resulting deficiency debt occurred earlier. He did not disclose the \nrepossession or the underlying debt on his SCA, or assert that it first arose after February \n2016. He acknowledged to the investigator that he did not disclose this repossession. In \nhis Answer, he said he did disclose it because he did not know that he owed any money \non the automobile after the car was returned. (Items 1, 2, 8)  \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBRs) from December 2017 and May 2016, public \nrecords, Applicant\u2019s 2008 bankruptcy documents, and his admissions, the SOR alleged \nfour financial security concerns. The status of each allegation is as follows: \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) In 2013, Applicant entered into a car lease. Toward the end of 2015 \nhe stopped making payments on the lease and it was repossessed. This $8,716 \nautomobile repossession debt was charged off in May 2016. Applicant stated he was \ntrying to negotiate a settlement. (Items 2, 4, 8) It is unresolved. \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) In 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a $29,236 income \ntax lien against Applicant for unpaid taxes related to a business he owned.1 He said his \nwife secured payment of this debt with the IRS through a home equity loan. It will be paid \nby the future sale of the house, unless he and his wife pay it sooner. He did not explain \nor justify his failure to timely pay the taxes involved, or submit any documentation from \nthe IRS corroborating the status of this debt or the settlement agreement. (Item 2) It is \nunresolved. \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c) In November 2017, Applicant\u2019s home state filed an income tax lien \nagainst him for $3,629. Applicant said his wife negotiated the same settlement noted \nabove with the state taxing agency. He did not submit documentation from the state \ncorroborating his assertion, or explain why he failed to pay the taxes when due. (Items 2, \n6) It is unresolved. \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d) In March 2008, Applicant and his wife filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \nThe bankruptcy petition listed outstanding income taxes owed to the IRS for years 2004, \n2005, and 2006, and state income taxes owed for those years. It also listed outstanding \nstudent loans. The total liability owed for unpaid state and Federal taxes, and student \nloans was listed as $194,206. Their unsecured nonpriority claims totaled $127,857, and \nincluded numerous medical debts, personal loans, credit cards, and professional fees. \nTheir personal and real assets totaled $577,031; and their liabilities totaled $893,643. The \nbankruptcy was discharged in June 2008. The final amount of debt discharged is unclear, \nbut delinquent tax and student loan debts are not usually eligible. (Item 7) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged in \u00b6 2.a that Applicant deliberately falsified information in his SCA \nbecause he failed to disclose the charged-off automobile repossession debt and the \nunpaid Federal tax lien filed in 2014. As noted above, Applicant said the 2014 tax \nomission was an oversight and not intentional. He said he did not report this repossession \nbecause he was unaware that he owed money on the lease.  \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant said his finances are more stable now and he continues \nto pay down his remaining debts. He said the monthly family income now exceeds their \nmonthly expenses. He stated that 10 years ago, he experienced financial difficulties \nbecause of the real estate market downturn and he was a sole business owner, raising \nthree young children. (Item 2) \n \n \n \n                                            \n1 The tax years are not in the record; however, Applicant listed his self-employment from 2010 to 2015 in \nhis SCA. (Item 3) \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused by or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 sets out disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns. Four are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has a long history of not meeting financial obligations, as confirmed by \na 2008 Chapter 7 bankruptcy in which he included a significant amount of debt. Since the \ndischarge of debt in 2008, he has continued to accumulate more debt as documented by \nsubsequent outstanding Federal and state income taxes and an automobile \nrepossession. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of \nthe security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 sets out five conditions that could potentially mitigate \nfinancial security concerns in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems that is ongoing and casts doubt on \nhis reliability and good judgement. His indebtedness is unresolved. There is insufficient \nevidence to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant did not provide a credible \nexplanation for failing to pay outstanding taxes or resolve the repossession debt. While \nhis wife may manage their finances, he remains responsible for the alleged SOR debts. \nHe failed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b), as there is insufficient proof that the \nSOR-alleged debts arose from circumstances beyond his control or that he acted \nresponsibly in addressing them. In fact, the evidence is to the contrary, as the IRS and \nstate filed liens in order to obtain payments. There is no evidence that Applicant received \ncredit counseling, or that his finances are under control. He did not submit evidence that \nhe initiated a good-faith effort to resolve the automobile repossession or document that \nhe has settlement arrangements with the IRS and state revenue agency. He did not \nestablish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (c), (d), or (g).  \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the security concerns relating to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. One may be potentially disqualifying: \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nThe evidence established insecurity concerns under AG \u00b6 16(a). Applicant failed \nto disclose required financial information. He provided no persuasive explanation or \nevidence for his failure to disclose the 2014 Federal tax lien and the vehicle loan \ndelinquency/repossession, in his February 2016 SCA. Considering his past financial \nproblems and the large amount of debt he accumulated since the 2008 bankruptcy, it is \nnot credible that he failed to disclose any derogatory information due to oversight or \nbecause he did not think he was required to report the repossession, on the basis he did \nnot know he owed money on the broken lease. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Five are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant did not provide evidence that would support mitigation under any of the \nforegoing conditions.  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n AG \u00b6 2(c) requires the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old man who has worked for a defense contractor since July \n2016. According to a 2008 Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, his financial delinquencies date \nback to 2004, when he did not timely pay Federal and state income taxes. In 2008, he \ndischarged a large amount of debt. Nonetheless, his financial delinquencies continued \naccumulating into 2017, when his home state filed a tax lien. He has not established a \ntrack record of responsibly managing his finances, given his long history of non-\ncompliance with fundamental legal obligations to pay taxes and resolve other debts. The \nrecord evidence leaves me with serious doubts about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand suitability for a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under the Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct guidelines.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n  \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n          Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \n   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n             Paragraph 2, Guideline E: \n \n \n      AGAINST APPLICANT \n\n \n \n \n \n9\n \n \n \n Subparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \n   Against Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On February 12, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 7, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2018.  The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on November 30, 2018, and \nthe hearing was convened as scheduled on December 6, 2018. The Government \noffered four exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 4, which were \nadmitted without objection. The Applicant offered nine exhibits at the hearing, referred \nto as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through I, which were admitted without objection.  Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf. The record remained open until close of business on \nDecember 20, 2018, to allow the Applicant the opportunity to submit additional \nsupporting documentation.  Applicant submitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit, referred to as \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A, which was admitted without objection.  DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 17, 2018. \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 68 years old. He is married with two children.  He has a Master\u2019s \ndegree in computer resource management.  He is employed with a defense contractor \nas a Lear Jet Pilot.  Applicant started working for his current employer in December \n2016, and is now reapplying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.  \n \nAfter completing his Bachelor\u2019s degree, Applicant was commissioned in the U.S. \nNavy in 1973.  Following a twenty year stellar Navy career, where Applicant served \nhonorably as a pilot, he retired in 1993.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.)  Throughout his military \ncareer, he held a security clearance without incident.  He then went back to school to \nobtain his Master\u2019s degree.   \n \nIn March 1995, Applicant went to work with Federal Express where he worked as \na flight engineer for four years, and then a co-pilot and pilot for sixteen years.  His job \nrequired him to have a security clearance and a Special Background Investigation, as \nhe carried weapons in the cockpit, and every six months had to requalify with the \nweapon.  Every two years he had to go through two days of hand to hand combat \nfighting in the cockpit in close quarters.  (Tr. p. 27.)  After retiring from Federal Express \nin 2015, Applicant has not had a clearance.  Applicant had no history of financial \nproblems during his Navy career or while working for Federal Express.  Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems began when he hired an attorney to assist him in obtaining two loan \nmodifications.       \n \n \n \nThe SOR identified two delinquent mortgage accounts on two separate homes \ntotaling in excess of one million dollars.  Applicant admits both allegations under this \nguideline.  Credit Reports of Applicant dated April 6, 2017; and February 1, 2018, \nconfirm the indebtedness listed in the SOR.  (Government Exhibits 3 and 4.)   \n \nApplicant explained that he had two houses, a primary residence in California, \nand a summer house in Montana.  Since both homes had variable interest rate loans, \nhis plan was to refinance the loans to get fixed rates once he retired from Federal \nExpress.  It about June 2015 Applicant received a letter from an attorney in a Real \nEstate Law Firm soliciting business, indicating that he could assist the Applicant in \nobtaining a mortgage refinance.  The cost to represent the Applicant with both \nproperties was $5,000 up front, and $1,500 monthly until the matters were concluded.  \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant hired the attorney, paid the initial fee of $5,000, and then paid the $1,500 fee \nfor twenty months, before learning that he had been swindled.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  \nThis was in December 2016, when Applicant learned that his primary residence was \nbeing foreclosed upon.  While Applicant thought that the attorney was working with the \nbank to get his mortgages refinanced, Applicant\u2019s Montana home was foreclosed upon \nand his primary residence in the process of being foreclosed upon and the attorney he \nhad hired was being disbarred for malpractice.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B, C, D and E.)  \nDuring the twenty months that Applicant was making payments to the attorney of $1,500 \nmonthly, Applicant continued to make his mortgage payments until the attorney told him \nto get at least two payments behind.  Eventually, Applicant stopped making the \npayments when the bank no longer accepted the payments because the house was in \nforeclosure.  It turns out that for some of 2916 and about all of 2017, Applicant did not \nmake his mortgage payments on his primary residence.  His attorney prepared and filed \na lawsuit on behalf of the Applicant against the bank for predatory lending.  When the \nattorney was disbarred, another law firm from Seattle took over the affairs from \nApplicant\u2019s attorney\u2019s real estate law firm.  The lawsuit was dismissed by the court in \nNovember 2018. \n \nSometime in 2018, Applicant hired a new attorney who recommended filing for \nChapter 13 bankruptcy to stop the Applicant\u2019s primary residence from being foreclosed \nupon.  Applicant testified that his current attorney is still trying to get his primary \nresidence refinanced with the bank.  However, since February 2018, Applicant has been \nmaking his mortgage payments of $2,901 each month to the bank.  In June 2018, he \nfiled for Chapter 13 bankruptcy and is following the monthly payment plan set up by the \nbankruptcy trustee in the amount of $4,440.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F, and Post Hearing \nExhibit A.)       \n \nThe following debts were alleged on the SOR:  \n \n1(a) A delinquent mortgage account owed to a bank with a total balance of \n$314,555.00 was past due in the amount of $71,432 and in foreclosure status.  \nApplicant explained that this was the debt owed on the Montana summer home.  It was \nforeclosed upon in February 2018 and sold in April 2018.  The house sold for $238,000 \nfor the property.  Applicant believes he owed $248,000 on the loan at the time of the \nsale.  (Tr. p. 51 - 52.)  Applicant states that the sale of the house settled the amount he \nowed on the loan.  Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A, indicates that there is no \noutstanding debt, as deficiency judgments are not allowed in Montana.       \n \n1(b) A delinquent mortgage account owed to a bank with a total balance of \n$724,222.00 was past due in the amount of $103,122.00.  Applicant\u2019s new attorney is \ncurrently in negotiations with the bank to obtain a loan modification.  As mentioned \nabove, Applicant has filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy to stop the foreclosure on his \nprimary residence.  Applicant is under the five year plan with the court, requiring him to \npay $4,440 monthly that goes toward his bills and mortgage arrearage.  Applicant \ntestified that after taxes, with his retirement as well as his current salary, he brings \nhome about $159,000 annually.  He stated that he can comfortably continue to make \nthese payments without difficulty.  Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A provides copies of \n\n \n4 \n \nchecks paid to the bankruptcy trustee each month from July 2018 through November \n2018 in the amount of $4,440. \n \n \nApplicant has received a number of awards and accolades during his career with \nthe Navy, his employment with Federal Express, and his current employer.  (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits G, H, and I.)   \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant became delinquently indebted when he hired the wrong attorney to \nhelp him obtain loan modifications for his properties.  Instead of being helpful, the \nattorney led him down the wrong path.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a)  the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n6 \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nCircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control started his financial problems.    \nApplicant was a victim of a crooked attorney, who squandered Applicant\u2019s money, and \ndid not properly represent his best interests.  As a result, the attorney was disbarred.  \nApplicant lost his summer home, and is currently involved in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nfor the next four years in order to keep his primary residence.  There is nothing else in \nthe record that leads one to believe that Applicant is not forthcoming or that he has \nbeen unreasonable and irresponsible.  In fact, from Applicant\u2019s experience, it can be \ngleaned that he clearly understands the responsibilities required in holding a security \nclearance.  He knows that he must live within his means at all times, and pay his bills in \na timely manner.  So far, he has acted reasonably and responsibly with respect to his \ndebts.  Much of his situation was not his fault, but can be attributed to the fact that he \ntrusted his attorney.  Accordingly, it is found that his debts are now under control.  \nFurthermore, Applicant has demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely.  \nThere are clear indications that his financial problems are being resolved.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n7 \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  Applicant honorably served our country on \nactive duty for twenty years and held a security clearance without incident.  Following \nthat he worked for Federal Express for another twenty years, held a security clearance \nand again had no problems.  Since obtaining a more competent attorney, following his \nadvice, Applicant has been making his mortgage payments, and following the \nbankruptcy trustee\u2019s payment plan according to the Chapter 13.  Applicant has shown \ngood judgment and reliability and demonstrated that he is financially responsible.          \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Between 2012 and \n2016, Applicant accumulated delinquent debt. Although she has resolved some of her \ndelinquent debt, she still owes over $30,000 in delinquent accounts, which mostly \nconsists of outstanding federal and state income taxes. Applicant has failed to \ndemonstrate that her finances are under control. Clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 26, 2018, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the financial considerations guideline. This action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, implemented on June 8, \n2017.   \n \nDOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be \nsubmitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge for \n\n \n2 \n \na determination whether to revoke her security clearance. Applicant timely answered \nthe SOR and requested a hearing. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1). At the hearing, convened \non February 27, 2019, I admitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9, without \nobjection. (Tr. 15, 17). Applicant did not offer any documents. The record remained \nopen until April 19, 2019. Applicant timely submitted  Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, which is \nadmitted without objection. (HE 2). DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 11, \n2019.  \n \nOn June 20, 2019, Applicant contacted Department Counsel to provide updated \ninformation about her employment. Although Department Counsel did not object to \nreopening the record for the consideration of new information, neither party presented \ngood cause for doing so. Accordingly, this decision is based on the record as it stands.  \n(HE III.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 46, has worked as a project manager for federal contracting \ncompanies since 1999. She has been in her current position since May 2018. Applicant \nhas previously held public trust eligibility and a security clearance issued by other \nfederal agencies. She completed her most recent security clearance application in \nSeptember 2014, disclosing four delinquent accounts and one account she was \ndisputing with a creditor. The ensuing investigation revealed additional delinquent \naccounts. The SOR alleges that Applicant owes $97,705 in delinquent debt, including \n$3,496 and $31,841 in outstanding state and federal income taxes, respectively. (GE 1 \n\u2013 7; Tr. 23-24). \n  \n \nApplicant blames her financial problems on a series of events between 2012 and \n2018. First, she experienced three periods of unemployment, totaling seven months. \nSecond, Applicant was involved in a serious motorcycle accident in March 2015 that \nresulted in months of recovery during which she collected disability income at a fraction \nof her pay. In March 2016, she lost her job earning $184,000. When she returned to \nwork in May 2016, she did so earning $120,000. Although, her income has increased \nover the years, she has not been able to secure a position at the pay she earned in \n2016. In addition, Applicant serves as the financial pillar of her family. She is often \ncalled upon to help family members with unexpected expenses, as was the case in \n2015, when she paid the burial and related expenses for two family members. Divorced \nin 2002, Applicant raised her two children, now adults, on her own without the benefit of \nchild support. She continues to provide financial support to one of her children and her \nparents, totaling $1,500 each month. (GE 1; Tr. 25-28, 30-32, 57-58, 60). \n \nIn her March 2018 answer to the SOR, Applicant provided documentation that  in \nFebruary 2018, she resolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \u2013 1.i, and 1.l \u2013 1.m, \ntotaling $3,350. She also established that she rehabilitated her mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.a, \n$21,175), to current status, explaining that she refinanced the loan and added the past-\ndue amount to the principal balance of the loan. However, at the hearing, Applicant \nadmitted that she was one month behind on the refinanced mortgage loan.  Applicant \nalso credibility testified that she was unable to find the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n \n\n \n3 \n \n($322). The delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.c, 1.j \u2013 1.k, and 1.o, totaling \nalmost $73,000, remain unresolved. (Answer; Tr. 17-22, 34-37, 40-42, 44-46). \n \nApplicant incurred the largest debt, SOR \u00b6 1.b for $27,401, when she was \nmedically evacuated by helicopter under emergent circumstances to a hospital after her \nMarch 2015 motorcycle accident. Her insurance carrier declined to cover the related \ncharges because the helicopter transport service, which Applicant did not choose, was \nout of network. Applicant claims that she has been making $150 payments each month \nsince November 2018. She did not provide any corroborating evidence of these \npayments. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is the deficiency balance on an automobile \nloan Applicant co-signed for her son. Applicant claims that the outstanding balance is \n$6,000, not $10,000 as alleged. She did not provide documentation to corroborate this \ninformation. (Tr. 37-40).  \n \nThe SOR debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k, and 1.o are related to outstanding \nstate and federal income taxes. Applicant blames her tax problems on the actions of the \ntax preparer she used at the time. In 2012, Applicant started her own business. She did \nnot understand the tax requirements of being self-employed. Relying on her tax \npreparer\u2019s advice, Applicant did not pay income taxes as she earned income, resulting \nin a $31,842 federal income tax obligation that she could not afford to pay. (Tr. 68-69). \n \n Applicant testified that she began mailing payments toward the 2012 federal tax \ndebt in November 2017 and that the  IRS entered into an installment agreement with \nher in February 2018. She agreed to pay $300 per month. In October 2018, the IRS \ncancelled the agreement for nonpayment. Applicant explained that she made her \nmonthly payments as required, but sent them to the wrong address. The IRS returned \nthe payments to her. After the hearing, Applicant negotiated a new installment \nagreement with the IRS, in which she agrees to pay $315 for 71 months to resolve her \ntax liability. According to documentation provided by Applicant\u2019s state tax authority, she \nowes $2,449 in unpaid state taxes. In December 2017, she established a monthly \npayment plan of $115. She did not provide a history of payments for her outstanding tax \nliabilities or documentation confirming the new installment agreement with the IRS. \n(Answer; AE A; Tr. 43, 48-50, 67).  \n \nThe record shows that Applicant failed to file her 2012 through 2014 federal \nincome tax returns on time. According to the tax transcripts, she did not file for \nextensions. The 2012 and 2013 returns were filed in August 2014. She filed her 2014 \nfederal income tax return in May 2015. In December 2017, Applicant received a letter \nfrom the IRS indicating that no returns were filed for the 2015 and 2016 tax years. It is \nunclear from the record when the returns were filed, but she did not owe any additional \ntax liabilities for either year. At hearing, Applicant testified that she had yet to file her \nfederal and state income tax returns for 2017. She filed the outstanding state and \nfederal income tax returns when she filed her 2018 returns in April 2019. She received \nrefunds for both years, which will be applied to her outstanding tax balances. (Answer; \nGE 2; AE A; Tr. 42-44, 47). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant currently earns $150,000. She also does occasional odd jobs to earn \nadditional money. In 2017, she sought financial counseling and made life style changes \nto reduce her delinquent debt. (Tr. 32-33, 63-65). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. (AG \u00b6 18). The SOR alleges that Applicant owes $97,705 in \ndelinquent debt including $31,841 federal income taxes and $3,496 in state income \ntaxes. The record is sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that \nApplicant has a history of not meeting her financial obligations and that she failed to \ntimely file and pay her state and federal income tax returns, as required. (AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) \nand (f)).   \n \nThe record contains some evidence in mitigation. Applicant has resolved the \naccounts alleged in SOR  \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \u2013 1.i, and 1.l \u2013 1.m and provided a legitimate basis for \ndisputing the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n. (AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and (e)). Although the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is large and remains unpaid, any potential security concerns are \nresolved in Applicant\u2019s favor because the debt is for emergency medical care that \nApplicant had no choice in selecting. She incurred this debt as the result of an \ninsurance carrier\u2019s decision to deny her claim. However, the favorable evidence in the \nrecord is not enough to mitigate the concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial history.  \n \nDespite Applicant\u2019s testimony on the efforts she has taken to rehabilitate her \nfinances, she failed to demonstrate that her finances are under control. She did not \nestablish that her mortgage is current. The automobile loan deficiency balance alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c ($10,120) remains unresolved and Applicant did not present a plan for \nrepayment. Applicant\u2019s unresolved federal and state income tax liabilities, totaling over \n$33,000, are of greater concern. She did not provide sufficient documentation to show \nthat she has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority or that she has \ncomplied with the agreements she testified are in place. Furthermore, Applicant has \nfailed to timely file her income tax returns for six of the last seven years. \n \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). After the Government presents evidence raising security \nconcerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. (See \nDirective \u00b6E3.1.15). An applicant is reasonably expected to provide corroborating \ndocumentation regarding her financial interests. Failure to produce corroborating \ninformation is relevant in deciding whether or not an applicant\u2019s claims should be \naccepted. Applicant\u2019s claims about the status of her outstanding tax liabilities and \nobligations are not supported by the record. She failed to meet her burden of production \nand persuasion to refute or mitigate the financial considerations allegations.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c., 1.j. \u2013 1.k., 1.o:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.d. \u2013 1.i., 1.l \u2013 1.n:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec.\nOr.)10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Security Executive Agent,\nby Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (SEAD 4). \n12/31/2018\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 4, 2018, and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on May 24, 2018. The Government\u2019s case consisted of three\nexhibits that were admitted without objection (GEs 1-3). Applicant relied on one witness\n(himself) and three exhibits that were admitted without objection (AEs A-C). The\ntranscript of the proceedings (Tr.) was received on August 2, 2018.\nProcedural Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with documentation of early\ntermination of his non-supervised probation and expungement. For good cause shown,\nApplicant was granted 60 days to supplement the record. Department Counsel was\nafforded seven days to respond. \nWithin the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with the following\ndocumentation: summary of charges and disposition of a March 2016 DUI charge,\ncharacter references, a DoD award recognizing Applicant\u2019s meritorious service as part\nof a DoD response to a 2015 cyber-security incident, and a minute order approving\nearly termination of Applicant\u2019s probation. Applicant\u2019s submission\u2019s were  admitted\nwithout objection as AEs D-G.\nSummary of Pleadings\n \nUnder Guideline  G, Applicant allegedly committed four alcohol-related offenses\nbetween March 1991 and March 2016. Specific allegations are as follows: (a) March\n1991 DUI charges with conviction of alcohol-related reckless driving; (b) October 1996\nDUI charges followed by conviction of the offense and sentencing of 30 days to home\nconfinement and placement on probation for three years; (c) April 1997 DUI charge\nfollowed by conviction of the offense and due to a previous probation violation,\nsentencing of 270 days of confinement and placement on probation for five years; and\n(d) March 2016 DUI charge followed by conviction of alcohol-related reckless driving\nand placement on probation until 2019. Alcohol-related allegations covered by\nGuideline G were incorporated under Guideline J.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the alcohol-related\nallegations with explanations. He claimed lapses in judgment that he deeply regrets. He\nfurther claimed he enrolled in an alcohol management program to help reinforce what\nhe knows to be the correct decision-making when addressing alcohol issues completed\nalcohol counseling, and provide him with additional tools for avoiding alcohol-related\nincidents in the future. \nFindings of Fact\n Applicant is a 48-year-old chief technologist for a defense contractor who seeks\na security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nadopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.\n2\n\nBackground\n                               \nApplicant married in October 2003 and has three children from this marriage.\n(GEs 1-2; Tr. 43) He attended a local community college between June 2008 and June\n2010, but did not earn a diploma. Between June 2010 and May 2012, he attended an\naccredited four-year university and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree. (GEs 1-2) Applicant\nreported no military service. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 50) \nSince March 2016, Applicant has been employed by his current defense\ncontractor. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 21, 47) Between March 1993 and March 2016 he was\nemployed as a division director for a DoD agency. Applicant has held a security clearance\nsince approximately 1995. (GE 1; Tr. 49)\nAlcohol-history\nApplicant presents with a lengthy record of alcohol-related offenses dating to\n1991. In March 1991, he was cited for DUI and later pled guilty to a reduced charge of\nalcohol-related reckless driving. (GEs 1-3) He had attended a local party with 50 to 60\npeople in attendance and consumed three to four beers. (GEs 2-3) Not convinced he\nwas intoxicated he headed home. On his way home, he was pulled over by police for\nspeeding. After acknowledging he had been drinking, the investigating officer at the\nscene administered a sobriety test to Applicant. Police thereafter escorted Applicant to\na county sheriff\u2019s office where Applicant was booked and fingerprinted before being\nreleased. In court, Applicant pled guilty to an alcohol-related reckless driving charge\nand was fined. (GEs 2-3)\nIn October 1996, Applicant was cited for DUI after being stopped and\nadministered a field sobriety test. Appearing in court, Applicant pleaded guilty to DUI.\n(GEs 2-3) He was fined $1,250 and sentenced to 31 days in jail. Records confirm that\nhe accepted an option from the court to serve 30 days of home confinement with an\nankle bracelet with three years of probation. Based on his probation violation, the\nsentencing court placed Applicant on three years of probation. Applicant is credited with\nsuccessfully completing his court-ordered home confinement. (GE 2) \nAppellant was cited for a third DUI offense in May 1997. (GEs 2-3) Returning\nhome from a party where he consumed alcohol with friends and family members, he\nstopped to rest.  When approached by an inquiring police officer, he acknowledged he\nhad been drinking and was escorted by the officer to a local police station where he\nwas booked,  fingerprinted, and released.  Applicant later pleaded guilty to DUI and was\ngiven the option by the court of serving 270 days of home confinement, and was placed\non probation. \nAppellant accepted the home confinement option offered by the sentencing\njudge in connection with Applicant\u2019s 1997 alcohol-related incident and took concerted\nsteps to change his drinking habits during the confinement period. (Tr. 24, 32-41)\nAdditionally, Applicant was required to complete an alcohol education program to retain \nhis drivers license, and was placed on probation by the sentencing court. (Tr. 23-24)\n3\n\nIn March 2016, Applicant was cited for DUI after being stopped by police. (GEs\n2-3) Applicant assured he did not exceed .08 BAC levels with his pre-arrest drinking.\nHis assurances are not challenged and are accepted. In court, Applicant pleaded no\ncontest to the DUI charges and was convicted of alcohol-related reckless driving. (GEs\n2-3 and AE G) He was fined $1,683, required to complete an alcohol education\nprogram, and placed on probation until 2019. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 23) \nUpon Applicant\u2019s September 2018 motion for early termination of probation,\nApplicant\u2019s motion was granted, and Applicant\u2019s probation was terminated, effective\nSeptember 18, 2018. (AE G) While his registered BAC level was only .07 percent, and\nunder the legal limit for driving with reported alcohol in his system, Applicant\nacknowledged his registered .07 BAC level was enough to support an alcohol-related\nreckless driving charge under his state\u2019s driving restrictions. (Tr. 31-34, 45-46) \nFollowing his 2016 alcohol-related reckless driving conviction, Applicant self-\nreferred himself to an outpatient alcohol counseling program. (AEs A-C) His recovery\nprogram consisted of 36 counseling sessions over a four-month period, along with\nrequired participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). (AE C) Applicant was\ncredited with successfully completing the program in June 2018. (AE A)\nBetween March 2016 and January 2018, Applicant continued to consume\nalcohol on an occasional basis (never to intoxication) without any further alcohol-related\nincidents. (Tr. 45-46) Since January 2018, he has ceased drinking altogether. (Tr. 45-\n46, 52) \nEndorsements and awards\nApplicant is highly regarded by his chief executive officer (CEO) and former\ncolleagues. (AE E) His CEO, who has known him for many years, attested to\nApplicant\u2019s strength of character and compassion for others. He credited Applicant\u2019s\nefforts in training wounded warriors and people with disabilities to integrate into\ncommon working environments. (AE E) He described Applicant as a cherished friend\nand all around great person who is thoughtful, reliable, and open in his professional and\nfamily relationships.\nA senior operating executive with Applicant\u2019s current defense contractor\nemployer who has known Applicant for a number of years credited Applicant with\ndeveloping a working pipeline of training and job placement of person\u2019s with disabilities\non to information technology service contracts with the DoD. (AE E) He praised\nApplicant for his enthusiasm in promoting his firm\u2019s organizational mission and culture\nof taking care of people. (AE E)   \nApplicant has been hailed as a featured speaker for federal law enforcement\nagencies. (AE E) A former colleague and current chief technology officer for Applicant\u2019s\nformer DoD agency who has known Applicant for many years extolled Applicant\u2019s\ntechnical contributions to upgrading his agency\u2019s security systems. (AE E) This current\nDoD agency head credited Applicant with having a limitless talent for finding solutions \n4\n\nand expressed his personal honor in having the opportunity to work with Applicant. (AE\nE) \nAmong Applicant\u2019s many awards is a bestowed award for excellence in 2016\nfrom a DoD under secretary of defense in recognition of Applicant\u2019s exceptional support\nof a DOD cyber-security project. (AE F) This award credited Applicant with exceptional\nmeritorious service in leading his DoD agency\u2019s contract action to provide identity\nprotection and restoration services in connection with a noted adverse cyber-security\nincident. (AE F)\nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used administrative judges in the decision-making\nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could\ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many\nof the conditions that could mitigate security concerns.\u201d  \nThe AGs must be considered before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not require\nadministrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is\nto be evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c). \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(d)\nof the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine\na sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made\nabout whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent in this case:\n5\n\n              Alcohol consumption \nThe Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the\nexercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold\nfinding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the\nDirective requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511\n(1995).  As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, the judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the\nultimate burden of demonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nApplicant comes to these proceedings with a considerable history of alcohol-\nrelated incidents over a 25-year period dating to 1991. Between March 1991 and\nMarch 2016, he pled guilty to four alcohol-related offenses. Principal security issues\n6\n\nraised in this case center on Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related offenses covered by\nGuideline G and incorporated under Guideline J.\nAlcohol consumption concerns\nApplicant\u2019s problems with recurrent alcohol-related incidents over a 25-year\nperiod raise concerns over his risk of future alcohol abuse. On the strength of the\nevidence presented, two disqualifying conditions (DCs) of the AGs for alcohol\nconsumption (AG \u00b6 21) may be applied: DC \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away\nfrom work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse,\ndisturbing the peace or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the\nindividual\u2019s alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol\nabuse disorder,\u201d and 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol use\ndisorder.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s completion of a self-referred alcohol counseling program in June\n2018 followed his last alcohol-related conviction in March 2016 based on a separate\nprovision in his state\u2019s vehicle code for drivers who do not meet the legal requirements\nfor driving over the established .08 BAC limits, but otherwise qualify for driving while\nintoxicated. Still, Applicant felt enough concern about his slip in March 2016 to self-refer\nhimself to a an outpatient counseling program. After reducing his drinking to occasional\ndrinking following his March 2016 incident, he ceased drinking altogether in January\n2018 and has remained abstinent to date. \nBased on the findings of the court considering his March 2016 incident and his\nproactive efforts since his March 2016 offense, he may take full advantage of the\nfollowing Guideline G mitigating conditions: MC \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much time has passed, or\nthe behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or judgment,\u201d and 32(d) \u201cthe individual has successfully completed a\ntreatment program along with required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and\nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with\ntreatment recommendations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s circumstances and subsequent actions\nfollowing his last alcohol-related incident are sufficient to facilitate safe predictions that\nhe will avoid any abusive drinking in the foreseeable future.\nCriminal conduct concerns\nSecurity concerns are also raised with respect to Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related\nincidents under the overlapping coverage of Guideline J. Disqualifying conditions\napplicable to Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related offenses under Guideline J (criminal conduct)\nare twofold: DC \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), \u201ca pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own\nwould be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in\ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness,\u201d and\n31(b), \u201cevidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and\nmatters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was\n7\n\nformally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d Each of these cited offenses are cross-\nreferenced under Guideline G and are considered to be alcohol-related for purposes of\nGuideline J analysis.  \nApplicable mitigating conditions covering Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related offenses\nunder Guideline J are as follows:  MC \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), \u201c\u201dso much time has elapsed since the\ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d and 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including, but not limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, restitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\u201d  Passage of time since Applicant\u2019s last alcohol-related offense in March\n2016 exceeds two years and provides enough time to mitigate these alcohol-related\noffenses under Guideline J as well.\nWhole-person assessment\nApplicant\u2019s lengthy civilian service with DoD (23 years) is respected and\nappreciated. Endorsements from his current employer and previous DoD agency\ndocument Applicant\u2019s strong character, trust, and reliability. His credits include letters of\nappreciation of his service as a speaker for a federal law enforcement agency and a\nDoD undersecretary recognizing his contributions to the DoD\u2019s cyber-security\nrestoration efforts. \nApplicant\u2019s recognized service contributions and letters of appreciation when\nconsidered in conjunction with the positive steps he has taken to mitigate security\nconcerns associated with his lengthy history of alcohol-related offenses are is enough\nto dispel concerns about risks of recurrent abusive drinking. Considering the record as\na whole, safe predictions can be made at this time about Applicant\u2019s ability to avoid\nalcohol-related incidents in the foreseeable future. Alcohol concerns are fully mitigated \nand enable favorable conclusions to be made in connection with the allegations\ncovered by Guidelines G and J.\n                                               Formal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE G (ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION):   FOR APPLICANT\n   \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:\n          For Applicant\nGUIDELINE J (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):            FOR APPLICANT\n   \nSubparagraph 2.a :                                For Applicant\n8\n\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nClearance is granted. \n                                          \nRoger C.

Applicant was previously employed with a DOD contractor from May 2006 until December 2015, and he held a DOD security clearance during that period. He was unemployed from about December 2015 to March 2017, when he obtained his real estate license. Applicant was hired by another DOD contractor approximately one year ago. His employer is requesting Applicant obtain a DOD security clearance in order to perform specific employment duties on DOD classified projects. (Tr. 10, 17-21, 23, 35, GE 1) The SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant was arrested in about December 2015, and charged with pornography-possession of obscene materials depicting minors, a felony. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted he was arrested, but denied that the arrest had any merit to support it. The judge set his bond at $250,000. Applicant stayed in jail for approximately three weeks since he was unable to make bail, but he was later released after his father paid $21,000.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \n \n \n \n \n Statement of the Case \n \n \nOn September 15, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application \n(SCA). On March 5, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action \nwas taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, \n2017.  \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn March 29, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR, and he requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On July 13, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of Hearing, setting the hearing for August 15, 2018. \nApplicant\u2019s request for a continuance was granted. On October 29, 2018, the case was \nassigned to me. On December 31, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of Hearing, setting the hearing for January 17, 2019. \n \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n3 into evidence, which I admitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s counsel proffered \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) A through F, which I admitted without objection. Applicant testified, \nand he had four witnesses testify on his behalf during the hearing. I held the record open \nuntil February 17, 2019, in the event either party wanted to provide additional \ndocumentation. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 28, 2019. No \nadditional documents were submitted, and the record was closed on February 17, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, including Applicant's \nadmissions, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 38 years old. He married in \nJanuary 2006, and he has one daughter, age 10. He claimed to be nine credit hours short \nof a bachelor\u2019s degree. Applicant was previously employed with a DOD contractor from \nMay 2006 until December 2015, and he held a DOD security clearance during that period. \nHe was unemployed from about December 2015 to March 2017, when he obtained his \nreal estate license. Applicant was hired by another DOD contractor approximately one \nyear ago. His employer is requesting Applicant obtain a DOD security clearance in order \nto perform specific employment duties on DOD classified projects. (Tr. 10, 17-21, 23, 35, \nGE 1)  \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant was arrested in about December 2015, and \ncharged with pornography-possession of obscene materials depicting minors, a felony. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted he was arrested, but denied that the arrest \nhad any merit to support it. The judge set his bond at $250,000. Applicant stayed in jail \nfor approximately three weeks since he was unable to make bail, but he was later \nreleased after his father paid $21,000. Applicant and his family had just moved to state A \nfive weeks earlier after he accepted a new job assignment from his former DOD contractor \nemployer. (Tr. 25, 28, 30, 41-42, 48, 50, 63-65; GE 2) \n \nApplicant admitted to looking at pornography on his computer for about the last 25 \nyears, including the five weeks he had lived in state A. His frequency of viewing \npornography varied, but he admitted to looking at it twice weekly in 2015. He denied ever \nintentionally looking for images of minors, or accidently looking at images of minors, \nduring the entire time period he accessed pornography on the internet. It became a habit \nfor him to view pornography, and he continued over the years because he believed that \nviewing pornography was not hurting anyone. (Tr. 25, 28-29, 30, 41-42, 48, 50, 63-65; \nGE 2)   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant stated at the hearing that on the day of his arrest, the police arrived early \nin the morning to his house with a search warrant. A police officer asked him if he knew \nwhy the police were in his home, and Applicant responded \u201cNo.\u201d The police officer told \nhim they were there looking for illegal pornography. The police confiscated his home \ncomputer, and other items, and placed Applicant under arrest. (Tr. 25-26)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s background interview occurred in April 2016, which was subsequently \nadopted by him on March 13, 2018, after he made several changes to the record. In the \ninterrogatories, Applicant listed, \u201cWhen they (police) first arrived, I did not know why they \nwere there. A couple of minutes later, they told me they were there because of the \nobscene material.\u201d He also wrote, \u201cThe charge related to pornography of teens under the \nage of 17 being on my computer, which would have been there from either downloading \nor viewing them on the internet. . . .  When the police came to my house, I admitted I had \npornography on my computer. . . .\u201d He told the investigator that his attorney informed him \nthat the criminal charges filed against him were for child pornography. The district attorney \n(DA) cancelled a meeting with his attorneys, and due to the cancellation, his attorneys \nwere unable to review any incriminating evidence the state had against him. Instead, the \nDA offered to dismiss the charges through a pretrial intervention program with specific \nconditions. The conditions included that he attend weekly meetings for a two-year period \nwith the state\u2019s sex offender group treatment program, and he pay approximately $1,250 \nin court costs. Applicant accepted the DA\u2019s offer and the charges against him were \ndismissed in February 2016. Applicant said that he neither admits, nor denies, his \ninvolvement which led to the criminal charges filed against him. (GE 2)  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant specifically denied ever looking at child pornography. He \nwas surprised about the criminal charges that were filed against him. He stated that the \ncourt dismissed his \u201ccase almost immediately.\u201d He only accepted the DA\u2019s offer because \nhe wanted to get this ordeal over with as quickly as possible, and he did not have the \nfinancial resources to fight the charges. This incident has taught him a valuable lesson, \nas he has not looked at any pornography for the past three years. The arrest has been a \nsource of embarrassment for him and his wife. (Tr. 28, 30-33, 39-40) \n \nAfter further questioning, Applicant admitted that the DA was not proposing to his \nattorneys that they would be \u201cdismissing the charges outright\u201d against him due to lack of \nevidence. He also agreed that if he had not met the conditions of the pre-trial intervention \nprogram, the DA could have refiled the criminal charges against him. He finished his \nsexual offender treatment program in a year-and-a-half, about six months early. He \ndenied receiving a diagnosis from the treatment program, or that he was required by the \nstate to register as a sex offender. (Tr. 43-44, 66) \n \n \nDuring the hearing, the following testimony was provided:  \nDepartment Counsel: And you in fact noted that in your response to the \ninterrogatories that the images (of minors 17 and younger) would have had to have \nbeen there (on his computer) from either downloading, or you said you were \nviewing them on the internet. \n  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant: That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s why I have no idea. I have no idea specifically \nwhat it was that they (police) were looking for because they never said so. And \nthey never told my attorneys. And the first case that they (attorneys) were going to \nask them (DA) about it, they (DA) decided \u2013 they (DA) declined to even offer up \nanything. \n \nDepartment Counsel: Well, they (DA) offered up the pretrial diversion program. \n \nApplicant: Yeah, I\u2019m saying they (DA) offered up no evidence of any type of \nwrongdoing whatsoever. From the first time I was arrested, they told my attorney \nabsolutely nothing.  \n \nDepartment Counsel: Okay, as far as you know. \n \nApplicant: Yeah, as far as what my attorney has expressed to me. (Tr. 47) \n \nApplicant claimed the reason his previous DOD contractor employer stopped \npaying him in December 2015 was not related to his arrest, but due to him not working \non the contract. He was told he was going to be continued as an employee while his \ncurrent security clearance was placed on \u201chold.\u201d He acknowledged this employer \nterminated his employment, but he was unsure of the date. His employer filed an incident \nreport in the Joint Personnel Adjudication System since he was arrested while in \npossession of a DOD security clearance. Applicant admitted receiving a letter in the mail \nfrom his employer and then applying for unemployment benefits. He was initially denied \nunemployment benefits due to his gross negligence, \u201cfailing to report to work\u201d for three \nconsecutive days. Applicant appealed that decision, and he did receive unemployment \nbenefits for a few months. (Tr. 33-34, 52-55, 58) \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-referenced SOR \u00b6 1.a under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). \nApplicant denied in his response to the SOR that he was involved in any conduct that \nquestioned his judgment, candor, or willingness to comply with rules pertaining to his \nDecember 2015 arrest. He stated: \u201cThe court system found no grounds to pursue any \ncase against me, . . .\u201d Applicant failed to provide any court documentation to support his \ncontention.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant intentionally misrepresented the criminal charge \nfrom his December 2015 arrest when he disclosed he had been charged with \u201cPossession \nof Obscene Materials,\u201d rather than \u201cPossession of Obscene Materials depicting a minor\u201d \non his September 2017 SCA. Applicant denied this allegation and stated he did not \nintentionally try to misrepresent this charge on his SCA. He listed the offense to put the \nGovernment on notice of his arrest, and he was not trying to conceal the nature of the \ncriminal offense in any way. \n \nApplicant disclosed information about his December 2015 arrest to his current \nDOD contractor employer. He also showed his employer the SOR and interrogatories. \nDespite this adverse information, his current employer continues to sponsor him for a \n\n \n5 \n \n \nDOD security clearance. The founder of the company appeared at the hearing, and stated \nthat he was aware of Applicant\u2019s security issues. He would not hesitate to place Applicant \nin a position of his company with full access to classified information. Three other \nwitnesses gave favorable recommendations for Applicant as well. (Tr. 59, 70. 76-79) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible for \npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n\n \n6 \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. \u2026 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 13, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; and \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress.  \n \n \nIn December 2015, Applicant was arrested after the police executed a search \nwarrant at his home, and he was charged with pornography possession of obscene \nmaterial depicting minors, a felony. The charges were dismissed after he accepted a \npretrial intervention program with conditions. The conditions included that he attend \nweekly meetings for a two-year period with the state\u2019s sex offender group treatment \nprogram, and he pay approximately $1,250 in court costs. The charges were not \ndismissed for lack of evidence, which raises questions about his judgment and potential \nvulnerability to coercion, exploitation, and duress. If Applicant had not fulfilled the pretrial \nintervention program conditions, the DA could have refiled the charges and continued \nwith prosecution of the case against him. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom sexual behavior. AG \u00b6 14 provides the following possible mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of similar nature; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment;  \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress;  \n \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment.  \n \n \n \nApplicant has continued to deny that the material confiscated by the police involved \nchild pornography, despite the fact he was arrested after the police executed a search \nwarrant at his home. He stated multiple times that the DA cancelled a meeting with his \nattorney. The purpose of this meeting was to show Applicant\u2019s attorney the incriminating \nevidence the DA had against him. Applicant alluded that the reason the DA offered to \ndismiss the charges against him was due to the fact that the DA did not have any evidence \nof child pornography. The established facts of record in the Government\u2019s exhibits do \ntend, however, to bring into question Applicant\u2019s judgment and current reliability. \nApplicant has completed a year-and-a-half of sexual offender treatment, but he does not \nadmit to viewing child pornography, to include an accidental image, over the span of \napproximately 25 years he has viewed pornography. I find his assertions unpersuasive. \nSince he has revealed the events to his wife and employer, \u00b6 14(c) applies, but is, in itself, \ninsufficient for a finding in his favor. I find \u00b6\u00b6 14(a), (b), (d), and (e) do not apply. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable under the established facts in this \ncase: \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and  \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sexual behavior (SOR \u00b6 1.a) was addressed under that specific \nguideline, and also cross-alleged (SOR \u00b6 2.a) under the personal conduct guideline. I \nhave previously addressed the issue under Guideline D. Disqualifying condition \u00b6 16 \n(e)(1) applies in this case. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant intentionally misrepresented the criminal charge \nhe listed on his 2017 SCA. There is insufficient evidence in the record to show that \nApplicant intentionally misrepresented or concealed the nature of his criminal charge \nwhen he disclosed his arrest on the 2017 SCA. Disqualifying condition \u00b6 16(a) does not \napply. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such \nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur;  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nApplicant has consistently denied that he viewed or possessed child pornography \nat any time. There is no evidence in the record to support his contention that the court \nsystem did not have any grounds to pursue criminal charges against him. He admitted \nduring the hearing that the DA did not dismiss \u201coutright\u201d the charges due to lack of \nevidence. Applicant also acknowledged that the DA could refile the charges against him \nif he did not complete the conditions outlined in his pretrial intervention program. His \ncontinued claim of innocence without supporting documentation is worrisome. To his \ncredit, Applicant completed a year-and-a-half of treatment and claimed that he has not \nviewed pornography for the last three years. He also told his wife and current employer \nabout the circumstances which resulted in his arrest. Mitigating condition \u00b6 17(e) does \nhave some application, but it is not enough for a favorable finding. His personal conduct \ncasts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and overall good judgment. Mitigating \nconditions \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), (d), and (f) do not apply. \n \n \n \n \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline D and \nGuideline E in my whole-person analysis. Applicant provided several favorable character \ntestimonials, to include support from his current employer, friends and associates. He \nadmitted being arrested, but denied he ever viewed child pornography. Applicant \nsuccessfully completed the conditions of his pretrial intervention program, and the \ncriminal charges against him were dismissed. Unfortunately, his favorable character \nevidence and his completion of a pretrial intervention program is not enough to absolve \nthe security concerns in this case.  \n \n \nApplicant averred the DA did not possess any evidence of child pornography \nagainst him, which was the reason he was offered the pretrial diversion program. He has \nviewed pornography for approximately 25 years, but denied that he has ever viewed an \n\n \n10 \n \n \nimage of a minor, even by accident, over that entire period of time. I find his assertions \nunpersuasive and unsubstantiated. Because protection of the national interest is the \nprinciple focus of these adjudications, any unresolved doubts must be resolved against \nthe granting of access to classified information.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n               \n            \n \n \n \n \n \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He is 37 years old. As of his 2015 security clearance application (SCA), he had never been married and he did not have any children.1 Applicant obtained his general education diploma in 2001. He attended college in 2006, 2012 to 2015, and re-enrolled as of his 2018 response to the SOR, but he had not yet earned a degree. He served honorably in the U.S. military from 2001 to 2009, during which time he deployed to the Middle East, Central and North America, and Iraq.

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 23, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline G (alcohol \nconsumption). The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nthe DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 26, 2018, and elected to have the case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. The Government\u2019s written case was \nsubmitted on June 28, 2018. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) \nwas provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant \n03/08/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nreceived the FORM on August 31, 2018. Applicant did not respond to the Government\u2019s \nFORM. The case was assigned to me on December 10, 2018. The Government\u2019s \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 6 are admitted in evidence without objection. \nOther than his Answer to the SOR, admitted into evidence as Item 3, Applicant failed to \nsubmit any additional documentation. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He is 37 years old. As of his 2015 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA), he had never been married and he did not have \nany children.1 \n \n \nApplicant obtained his general education diploma in 2001. He attended college in \n2006, 2012 to 2015, and re-enrolled as of his 2018 response to the SOR, but he had not \nyet earned a degree. He served honorably in the U.S. military from 2001 to 2009, during \nwhich time he deployed to the Middle East, Central and North America, and Iraq. He \nreceived numerous medals for his military service. He previously worked overseas for \ntwo U.S. defense contractors from 2010 to 2013, and he was unemployed from 2013 to \n2015. He has worked as an engineer for a defense contractor since 2015, and he \nreceived a promotion and recognition awards between 2016 and 2018. He was first \ngranted a security clearance in 2003.2   \n \n \nApplicant has consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to the point of \nintoxication, since age 16. He drank two to three beers once to twice yearly until July \n2002, when he turned 21 years old. He acknowledged that his heavy alcohol abuse \nstarted during his military service. He then drank four to five beers or hard liquor drinks \non the weekends at social gatherings. Before his April 2016 driving under the influence \n(DUI) conviction, further discussed below, he drank between five and fifteen beers on \nthe weekends. He described his drinking habits during his 2017 background interview \nas moderate, stating that he drank occasionally. In January 2017, he drank three beers \nand three glasses of champagne. In February 2017, he drank two beers with dinner. In \nJune 2017, he drank two beers. As of his 2018 response to interrogatories, he last \ndrank three glasses of champagne in December 2017.3 \n \n \nIn April 2000, Applicant was charged and convicted of DUI. He was 18 years old. \nHe was at a friend\u2019s sister\u2019s house and he drank two to three beers. He did not believe \nhe was intoxicated and he drove his friend home. He was pulled over by a police officer \nand administered a breathalyzer. Though his blood alcohol content (BAC) was .04%, \nthe officer arrested him because he was a minor. He was fined and his driver\u2019s license \nwas suspended for one year.4 \n                                                          \n1 Items 1, 3, 4.  \n \n2 Items 3-5.  \n \n3 Items 1, 3-6. \n \n4 Item 1, 3-6. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn September 2013, Applicant was charged and convicted of DUI. He had been \nwatching football at his cousin\u2019s house, where he drank six to seven beers. He did not \nbelieve he was intoxicated, attempted to drive home, and got into an accident. He was \narrested, administered a breathalyzer, and his BAC was .16%. He was fined, ordered to \ntake a drug and alcohol awareness course, and his driver\u2019s license was revoked for \nthree months. He complied with the court\u2019s sentence and his driver\u2019s license was \nreinstated in February 2014. Applicant stated during his 2015 background interview that \nhe had no future intentions of drinking and driving.5 \n \n \nIn April 2016, Applicant was charged with DUI. He was with friends watching a \nhockey game at a sports bar. He drove to the bar but planned to take an Uber home.   \nHe drank seven to eight beers and three to four shots of hard liquor over three hours. \nHe drove to a friend\u2019s house nearby, with the intention of sleeping off the alcohol before \ndriving home later. En route, he realized he was too drunk to drive so he pulled into a \nresidential neighborhood to sleep. He was arrested after a resident reported an \nunknown parked car in the neighborhood, and the officer smelled alcohol on him. He \nwas sentenced to one year of supervised probation, one year of a suspended driver\u2019s \nlicense, fined, 50 hours of community service, and DUI and victims awareness courses. \nHe was also ordered to attended counseling and treatment.6 \n \n \nApplicant attended an outpatient program consisting of 24 group counseling \nsessions, two individual sessions, and 12+ Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings from \nMay to August 2017, when he completed the program. A discharge summary record \nreflects: \n \n[Applicant] accepted the consequences of his alcohol use and understands the \nrisks of continued use of any mood altering substance . . . He appears sincere \nabout remaining substance fee.7 \n \nHis discharge diagnosis reflects an Axis I diagnosis of \u201cAlcohol Abuse (In Remission) \u2013 \nF10.10,\u201d states that his prognosis is \u201cGood, if [Applicant] follows recommendations,\u201d and \nrecommends that Applicant abstain from all mood altering drugs and continue AA \nattendance.8 \n \n \nIn his October 2017 background interview, Applicant stated that he did not \nbelieve he had an alcohol dependence issue, but he considered himself an alcoholic \nbased on information he obtained from the counseling sessions. Though he stated that \nhe does so only rarely, he acknowledged in both his 2017 background interview and his \n2018 response to the SOR that he still consumed alcohol. He decided to decrease his \n                                                          \n5 Items 1, 3-6. \n \n6 Item 1, 3-6. \n \n7 Item 1, 3-6. \n \n8 Item 3. \n\n \n4 \n \nalcohol consumption because he learned from the counseling sessions that alcohol \ncould negatively impact him. He sold both of his vehicles and decided to bicycle or Uber \nwherever he goes. He stated that he previously drank alcohol to feel happy and relieve \nwork stress, but realized that he could exercise and listen to music instead. He did not \nprovide evidence of continued AA attendance. He stated that his DUIs are common \nknowledge among his family and friends.9 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n                                                          \n9 Item 1, 3-6. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 22. \nThe disqualifying conditions potentially applicable in this case include:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \n \nApplicant has a pattern of excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol-related \nincidents away from work. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) are applicable. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides the following relevant conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \n\n \n6 \n \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol-related \nincidents did not happen under unusual circumstances that are unlikely to recur, are \nrecent, and are not mitigated by the passage of time. Though Applicant was diagnosed \nupon discharge from treatment in 2017 with alcohol abuse in remission, he was \nrecommended to abstain from all mood altering substances and continue AA. Yet, he \nadmitted that he still consumed alcohol and he did not provide evidence of continued \nAA attendance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), 23(b), and 23(d) are not established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G in this whole-person analysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s honorable military \nservice and his deployments overseas.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant failed \nto mitigate the alcohol consumption security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \n \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana sporadically from 2001 through 2008, \nand again over the course of a few weeks in October 2015. She has held a security \nclearance since 2011. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(f) are applicable. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \n \n \nApplicant experimented with marijuana while she was in college and graduate \nschool. During her background interview in 2010, she stated that she regretted using \nmarijuana and she did not intend to use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future. \nShe abstained from 2008 until she used marijuana to alleviate her pain in 2015. She \nknew that her marijuana use was against federal law and contrary to her company\u2019s and \nDOD\u2019s policies, even though it was not illegal under local law and even if it had been \nprescribed by a doctor. However, she did not realize the full ramifications of her actions. \nHaving gone through this process, I am convinced that she does now.   \n \n \nApplicant provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all illegal drug use \nwith the acknowledgment that any future involvement with illegal drugs would be \ngrounds for revocation of her security clearance. She credibly testified that she will not \nuse any illegal drugs, including marijuana for pain management, in the future. She fully \ndisclosed her drug use on her SF 86 and during her background investigation, which \nbolsters her credibility. I find that Applicant has abstained from illegal drug use for an \nappropriate period, and that illegal drug use is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) \nare applicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n6 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s strong character \nevidence. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Catie E. Young, Attorney At Law, Griffith, Young & Lass \n \n \nMarch 25, 2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn April 25, 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP). \nOn January 24, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F Financial Considerations.  The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO)10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines, effective within the DoD after June 8, 2019.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 30, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 15, 2018.  The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on November 15, 2018, and \nthe hearing was convened as scheduled on December 7, 2018. The Government \noffered four exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 4, which were \nadmitted without objection. The Applicant offered seven exhibits, referred to as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through G, which were admitted without objection.  Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf. The record remained open until close of business on \n\n \n2 \n \nJanuary 11, 2019, to allow the Applicant the opportunity to submit additional supporting \ndocumentation.  Applicant submitted four Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as \nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits H through K, which were admitted without objection.  \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 11, 2019. \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 64 years old. He is married with four grown children.  He has two \nMaster\u2019s degrees, one in Business Administration, and one in Law.  He also holds \nvarious certifications.  He is employed with a defense contractor as a Technology \nConsultant/Engineer.  He is applying for a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment.    \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. The SOR \nidentified four delinquent student loan or educational debts totaling in excess of \n$100,000, as well as a Chapter 7 bankruptcy wherein he discharged approximately $3.5 \nmillion in delinquent debt, most of which were delinquent mortgage accounts for six \nforeclosed properties.  Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR \nunder this guideline.    Applicant has been working for his current employer since April \n2016.  Credit Reports of Applicant dated July 9, 2016; and June 6, 2017, confirm the \nindebtedness listed in the SOR.  (Government Exhibits 3 and 4.)   \n \nApplicant has a steady employment history.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  His wife, \nwith whom he has been married for 35 years, also worked outside the home for a time, \nand generated income for the family.  Applicant\u2019s explained that his wife is from a family \nof real estate professionals and at some point, she became a real estate broker.  From \n2001 to 2006, with the growing real estate economy in the state, Applicant and his wife \ntook their excess disposable income, and purchased a number of investment properties, \nin hopes of it sustaining their expenses.  At the time, Applicant was sending his four \nchildren to a prestigious private school and lived a comfortable lifestyle.   \n \nIn 2006, Applicant\u2019s wife began to have a series of health problems which \neventually caused her to stop working.  By this time their children were in college and \nApplicant had cosigned for their student loans.  As the value of their real estate \nproperties started declining, renters started defaulting on rent.   Applicant could not \nafford to pay the mortgages on their properties, nor did he have the money to pay his \nchildren\u2019s student loans.  He tried to get deferments, or forbearance type of extensions \non the student loan debt, but was unsuccessful.  During this period, Applicant even \nrelocated without his wife to take a higher paying job.  More, recently, he has had to \nmove his mother-in-law in with them, to take care of her.   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n1.a.  In 2013, to clear up his financial problems, Applicant hired an attorney who \nrecommended that they file for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy protection.  In June 2013, \nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, and in September 2013, his debts of \napproximately $3.5 million were discharged.  Applicant was unable to discharge the \nstudent loans pursuant to Federal Bankruptcy Law.  Related to this filing, Applicant \nreceived a certificate of financial counseling.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  \n \n1.b.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for a student loan that was past due in the \namount of $2,231 with an approximate balance of $48,319.  Applicant cosigned on his \ndaughter\u2019s student loan for college.  When he entered into the agreement, he thought \nthat his daughter would be able to pay the debt.  The debt has been owing since 2009.  \nApplicant has tried to initiate payment by website, but his account cannot be located.  \n(Tr. p. 43)  It is his intent to pay the debt if he can find out who to pay.  He has also \ndisputed the debt with the credit agencies.  (Tr. p. 78.)  Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit \nK indicates that Applicant has been made an offer to settle the debt by the creditor in \nthe amount of $371 monthly for eleven months beginning on January 15, 2019, with a \nballoon payment of $5,919 due on December 15, 2019.     \n \n1.c.  Applicant was indebted to a bank for a delinquent student loan that was charged \noff in the approximate amount of $31,976.  Applicant cosigned on his son\u2019s student loan \nfor college.  When he entered into the agreement, he thought that his son would be able \nto pay the debt.  This debt was ultimately charged off.  Applicant received a 1099-C \ncancellation of debt regarding the debt.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B and I.)  Applicant stated \nthat he has paid taxes on the amount of the forgiveness.  (Tr. p. 48.)       \n \n1.d and 1.e.  Applicant was indebted to a bank for two educational loan accounts that \nwere charged off.  Applicant cosigned on his childrens\u2019 loans for their education.  Both \nloans were ultimately charged off by the creditor.   Applicant received a 1099-C for each \ndebt, which was a cancellation of the debts.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C, and Tr. p. 51.)  \nApplicant stated that he has paid taxes on the amount of the forgiveness.  (Tr. pp. 51-\n52.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit report showed another charged-off account, not listed in the \nSOR, in the amount of $31,997, showing a past-due amount of $30,597.  Applicant did \nnot know about the debt.  Post-Hearing Exhibit H, indicates that the creditor has \nextended an offer to Applicant to make payment arrangements to resolve the debt. \n \nSince he has been working for his current employer, Applicant\u2019s financial affairs \nhave been more stable.  He has incurred no new delinquent debt.  He now owns only \none property, his primary residence, and is current on the mortgage payments.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)  Applicant is also current with all of his consumer debt.  He has \nlearned a hard lesson from his mistakes in the past.  He now lives within a budget, and \nmakes smart decisions as to how he spends his money.  Applicant recently started a \n401(k) that has about $3,000 in it.  (Tr. p. 53.) \n \nLetters of recommendation from Applicant\u2019s colleagues and friends reveal that \nApplicant is a true professional, who is committed to work, his family, and enjoying the \n\n \n4 \n \nfreedoms our country provides.  He is respected by all who know him.  He has \nconsistently provided exceptional work effort and productivity.  He is also described as \nbeing a hard-working, honest and trustworthy man of integrity, who is a wonderful \nfather, co-worker, friend and human being.  He is highly recommended for a security \nclearance.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.)     \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant became delinquently indebted due to a series of unexpected \ncircumstances beyond his control.  In hindsight, Applicant realizes that he made some \nrisky and reckless decisions when he invested in real estate too quickly, and in too \nmany properties, without a sufficient financial safety net.  To complicate matters, his \nwife\u2019s illnesses prevented her from working, which negatively impacted their finances.  \nThe sudden downturn in the real estate market also caused them to fall behind on their \nmortgage payments.  Applicant\u2019s children\u2019s inability and unwillingness to pay their \nstudent loans, leaving it all up to the Applicant, all contributed to his financial \nindebtedness.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant now understands the vastly unstable nature of the real estate market \nand that it can ruin one\u2019s financial status, if not careful.  As a result, in 2013, he was \nforced to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and discharged $3.5 million dollars in debt.  \nUnable to discharge the student loans, and unable to afford to make the payments, the \ndebts were charged off.  Applicant has paid taxes on the student loan debt that was \ncancelled or forgiven, and plans to follow a prescribed payment plan to resolve the only \nother remaining student loan that remains unaddressed in the SOR.  Applicant\u2019s \nconduct shows growth and maturity toward handling his financial affairs.  He has no \nother delinquent accounts and now understands the importance of maintaining financial \nresponsibility.  Going forward, Applicant must live within his means and continue to \nresolve his debts in compliance with his creditors.  Under the particular circumstances \nof this case, Applicant has acted reasonably and responsibly with respect to his debts.  \nAccordingly, it is found that his debts are now under control.  Furthermore, Applicant \nhas demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely.  If it is determined that he \nowes any other creditor, he will immediately set up a payment arrangement to resolve it.  \nThere are clear indications that his financial problems are being resolved.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  Applicant is well respected on the job and \nperformed favorably.  He has also demonstrated reasonable and responsible conduct in \nresolving his delinquent debts.  In addition, he has provided documentation from the \ncreditors that confirm his testimony.  Applicant has demonstrated that he is financially \nresponsible.          \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 17, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 1, 2018. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October \n12, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on November 6, 2018. The Government \n01/23/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \noffered exhibits (GE) 1 through 5.1 Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) \nA and B. There were no objections to any exhibits offered, and all were admitted into \nevidence. The record was held open until November 20, 2018, to allow Applicant to submit \nadditional documents, which he did. They were marked AE C though F and admitted into \nevidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript on November 15, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.e. He denied the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \ntestimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 60 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1982. He married in \n1984 and divorced in 1994. He remarried in 1999 and has a 16-year-old child from that \nmarriage and an adult stepchild. He has worked for his present employer, a federal \ncontractor, since August 2016. Applicant completed a security clearance application \n(SCA) in April 2017. He disclosed short periods of unemployment between contracts. He \ntestified that he worked part-time from May 2014 to December 2014. He disclosed he was \nunemployed from February 2007 to October 2008. He received unemployment \ncompensation for this period. He testified that his current salary is $120,000. His wife \nchose not to work in the past year so she could spend time with her grandchild.2  \n \n \nDuring his July 2017 interview with a government investigator, Applicant was \nconfronted with the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($46,926). He did not disclose this debt on \nhis SCA. He told the investigator that this was due to an error. He told the investigator \nthat he believed this account may have related to a former home mortgage in 2013. The \naccount was sold many times, and he believed the current creditor may hold the equity \nloan. The equity loan went delinquent after he did a short sale on his former residence in \nJanuary 2014, but he was unaware that there was an open collection account for the loan. \nHe intended to attempt to reach a settlement with the creditor and pay off the balance as \nsoon as possible.3  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He stated:  \n \n \nI do not any have any recollection of this debt being mine or its origin (sic). \nThis debt no longer appears on my credit report and my preliminary \ninvestigation shows this debt to be at least 10 years old. I was going to \ndispute this debt, but my research shows that it is beyond the statute of \n                                                          \n1 Hearing Exhibit (HE) I is the exhibit list and II is the discovery letter. HE III is an email from Department \nCounsel noting he had no objections to AE C though F.  \n \n2 Tr. 22-27; GE 1, 2. On his SCA, Applicant disclosed his employment history. When he was interviewed \nby the government investigator, he modified and corrected his history. His testimony was not consistent \nwith the previous dates provided. \n \n3 GE 2. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nlimitations and no legal advantages would be gained if I successfully \ndisputed the debt.4 \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a did not belong to him. He had another \naccount with the same creditor that was in good standing. He said he contacted this \ncreditor in January 2018, but did not ask about this debt because he said it does not \nbelong to him. He claimed he had a checking account stolen in 2006. He did not file a \npolice report. He did not contact anyone about this account. He said he was not contacted \nby a collection company. He stated it is only reported on one credit report. He disputes \nits accuracy. He said he was not going to dispute a 10-year-old debt. He admitted that he \nwas worried about the statute of limitations resetting.5  \n \n \nApplicant further stated that he had a lawyer when he had to do a short sale on his \nhouse. He was told by the lawyer not to pay any of his debts, but he continued to pay his \ndebts. His lawyer advised him to file bankruptcy, but he did not want to do that. He \nestimated this occurred around 2010. He did a short sale on his house in 2014 because \nhe had trouble making mortgage payments and was living off of credit cards. He further \nstated that he had one unsettled debt with this same creditor for an equity loan, and he \nassumed this was the same debt. He also stated that based on the amount of the debt \nhe believed it was likely the same debt. The account is listed on his May 2017 credit \nreport, which shows the account was opened in June 2013, and the last activity was in \nApril 2017.6 The debt is unresolved.  \n \n \nApplicant was also confronted by the investigator with all of the debts alleged in \nthe SOR. He had disclosed on his SCA that he settled the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($88), 1.c \n($224), and 1.e ($74) with collection companies by making prescribed payments. During \nhis interview, he stated these debts were for utilities owed on a former residence. He did \nnot receive the bills when he moved and later learned the accounts were delinquent and \nin collection. He told the investigator when he became aware of the debts, he contacted \nthe original creditors and was advised the debts were held by collection companies. He \nsaid he made an error on his SCA, and the debts were not settled or paid as reported. He \ntold the investigator that he was aware all three accounts remained unpaid. He said he \nwas upset that he was not contacted by the original creditors before the accounts were \nplaced in collection. He did not want to pay the collection agencies because they bought \nthe debt for a much lower amount of money than what he owed. He does not agree with \nthe collection process in general and would have no problem paying the original creditors \ndirectly. He would pay the delinquent collection accounts if it is required for him to obtain \na security clearance, but otherwise he did not intend to pay the debts as it will have a \nnegative effect on his credit score regardless.7 \n                                                          \n4 Answer to SOR. \n \n5 Tr. 34-36. \n \n6 Tr. 28-38, 64-65. \n \n7 GE 1, 2. In his SCA, Applicant disclosed he had utilities bills that were in collection status. Applicant stated, \n\u201cSettled debt with collections by making prescribed payments.\u201d  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He stated he \nhad no recollection of this debt belonging to him or its origin. He was unsuccessful in his \n\u201cinitial attempts to dispute the debt and decided to not pursue any correction to the credit \nreport as this debt is no longer listed.\u201d Applicant stated he has a current account with this \ncreditor. Applicant testified that he contacted the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b and was told it no \nlonger had a record of any unpaid account. He said he tried to pay the original creditor. \nApplicant\u2019s testimony is inconsistent with his SCA disclosure and statements made to the \ngovernment investigator.8 This debt is unresolved.  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, Applicant acknowledged owing the debts in \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c and 1.e. He reiterated he was unaware the accounts were in collection until 2017. He \ndid not want to pay a collection company because the debts already had a negative \nimpact on his credit rating. He did not intend to pay them. He stated that he is now aware \nof his error and contacted the collection companies for the debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e, and \npaid the accounts. He provided documented proof of his payments.9 The debts are \nresolved. \n \n \nApplicant was confronted by the government investigator with the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($9,253). He failed to disclose this debt on his SCA. He told the investigator \nhis failure to report the debt was due to error. He acknowledged the debt to the \ninvestigator and explained it was a credit card debt that became delinquent in 2013. He \nwas offered a settlement agreement by the creditor in 2013, but he could not afford to pay \nit. The debt was charged off. Applicant told the investigator that he received a cancelation \nof the debt for 2014 and it was included in his 2014 tax return.10  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the debt in \u00b6 1.d and said the debt \nbecame delinquent in 2014 after the early termination of a contract he was working on. \nHe said he contacted the creditor because he could not pay the debt. He could not pay \nthe settlement offer and the account became delinquent. He said when he resumed \nemployment, and after he caught up on all of his past due accounts, he learned the debt \nwas charged off. He said in his answer:  \n \nIn addition, I had not received any collection notices so I thought this debt \nwas already included as income for me. I see now that I was wrong. Even \nthough the account shows it has been charged off, there is still an \noutstanding balance showing, and even though I have negative feelings \nabout how the customer service at [creditor] treated me relative to all the \nother creditors who were willing to work with me during my unexpected \nemployment, I understand I owe what I owe. I was contacted by [creditor] \nearlier this month and I have agreed to a repayment plan. This plan requires \n                                                          \n8 Tr. 39-48. \n \n9 Tr. 48-50, 58; Answer to SOR. \n \n10 GE 2. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nless than the full amount because I have agreed to repay them in 1 year \ninstead of 5.11  \n \n \nApplicant testified that in 2014 he tried to work out an agreement with the creditor \nin SOR \u00b6 1.d, but could not afford the payments. He said he thought this debt was included \nas a cancelation of debt and an IRS 1099C form was issued. He did not attempt to pay \nthe debt until after he received the SOR because he did not want to restart the statute of \nlimitations clock.12 Applicant provided a copy of the settlement agreement to pay $385 a \nmonth for 12 months for a total settlement of $4,626. He also provided proof that he has \nmade payments from March through August 2018.13 It is being resolved.  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he does not owe the collection companies and does not \nhave an obligation to them. He did not borrow money from the collection company. He \nstated: \u201cI paid every debt that I could research and find that were mine.\u201d18 \n \n \nThe Government\u2019s evidence included five IRS 1099-C Cancelation of Debt forms \nfrom the same creditor for tax year 2014. The amounts of the canceled debts were $7,859, \n$9,637, $2,409, $4,925 and $1,453. An additional IRS 1099-C form was also included as \nevidence from a different creditor in the amount of $3,448.19 These discharged debts \nwere not alleged in the SOR. The allegations in the SOR are supported by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, testimony, and credit reports from May 2017 and January 2018.20 \n \n \nApplicant testified that when he understood he was required to pay collection \naccounts he did. He admitted he had to rely on credit cards for a period after his \nunemployment to pay his bills. He also stated that he had investments that did not work \nout. He participated in financial counseling as part of the Home Affordable Refinance \nProgram. His current finances are better. He has four or five credit cards that he pays \nmonthly and have a cumulative balance of approximately $14,000. He owns four vehicles, \nincluding a 2018 recently purchased car. At the end of the month, he has several hundred \ndollars in expendable income. He does not have any savings and has about $20,000 in \na 401K account. Post-hearing, Applicant provided copies of credit reports from November \n                                                          \n11 Answer to SOR. \n \n12 Tr. 50-58. \n \n13 AE A. An additional document was provided of a check transfer made in October 2018 that shows a $400 \ntransaction. It does not indicate the name of the creditor, but because it is included with the other payments, \npresumably it is to the same creditor. \n \n18 Tr. 67-69. \n \n19 Tr. 59-62; GE 5. I have not considered any derogatory information that was not alleged for disqualifying \npurposed. I may consider it when making a credibility determination, in the application of mitigating \nconditions, and in a whole-person analysis.  \n \n20 GE 1, 2, 3, 4. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n2018 from the three major credit bureaus. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is not reported on \nthem.21 \n \n \nApplicant made numerous inconsistent statements in his government interview, \nanswer to the SOR, and testimony. I did not find him credible.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n                                                          \n21 Tr. 71-77. AE D, E, F. One vehicle is a vintage car that Applicant has registered and insured, but does \nnot drive. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has delinquent debts that began accumulating in about 2013 that he was \nunable and unwilling to pay. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \n \n \nApplicant has been aware he had delinquent debts that he did not want to pay \nbecause he did not like the collection agency process. He told the government \ninvestigator that he would pay the debts if his security clearance was contingent on it. He \neventually paid the debts that were in collection in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e. He claimed the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.d had been canceled by the creditor, and it was included in his 2014 tax \nreturns. He later acknowledged it was not canceled, and after receiving the SOR he made \npayment arrangements. Applicant also acknowledged he had a large equity loan \nassociated with his house that went through a short sale. He told the investigator he would \ncontact the creditor and resolve the debt. He later denied the debt. He failed to contact \nthe creditor and stated the debt was over 10 years old and subject to the statute of \nlimitation. Applicant could have called the creditor, and determined the origin of the debt, \nbut he refused to do so. There is sufficient evidence this debt belongs to Applicant, \nalthough it is no longer listed on his current credit reports. Applicant repeatedly provided \ninconsistent information and testimony about his debts. There is insufficient evidence to \nconclude future financial problems are unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s conduct casts doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to periods of unemployment, which were \nbeyond his control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has been employed since August 2016. \nHe told the government investigator that he did not want to pay collection agencies on \ndebts he legitimately knew he owed because he does not like the process. He would only \ndo so if he was required to do so in order to obtain his security clearance. After receiving \nthe SOR he paid the delinquent utilities bills owed. He was not happy with the creditor in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d, but eventually arranged a payment plan after receiving the SOR. He \npreviously claimed the debt was included in his 2014 tax return, but that information was \nincorrect. He acknowledged during his interview that he had an equity loan associated \n\n \n9 \n \n \nwith the short sale of his house. He said his lawyer told him not to pay his debts. He was \ngoing to contact the creditor and resolve the debt. Later he denied owing the debt and \nhas not contacted the creditor. Applicant has not acted responsibly regarding his debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies.  \n \n \nApplicant said he went through financial counseling when he participated in HARP. \nHe is making payments on one debt, but has not resolved or contacted the creditor for \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He did not resolve the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. There is some evidence \nthat his finances are coming under control, but his failure to address the largest debt \nalleged is a concern. I find \u00b6 AG 20(c) marginally applies. Applicant paid the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e after receiving the SOR. He made payment arrangements for the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d after receiving the SOR. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to these debts.  \n \n \nApplicant told the government investigator that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a was related \nto an equity loan. He explained how it originated. He intended to resolve it with the \ncreditor. He later denied knowing anything about the debt. He refused to contact the \ncreditor to determine its origin and validity. There is sufficient proof that the debt belongs \nto him. Throughout this investigative process, Applicant has made inconsistent \nstatements. Regardless of whether the debt is beyond the statute of limitation, which he \nfailed to show, Applicant has not resolved it. I have considered the fact that it is not listed \non his most current credit reports. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n\n \n10 \n \n \nApplicant is 60 years old. He experienced periods of unemployment that impacted \nhis finances. Applicant had six debts totaling approximately $29,731 that were canceled \nin 2014. He has resolved two small debts alleged in the SOR and has a payment \narrangement for another debt. Applicant did not take action on these debts until after he \nreceived the SOR. He told the government investigator that he would not pay debts that \nwere held by collection agencies because he did not like the process, but would pay the \ndebts if it would impact his ability to obtain a security clearance. Applicant acknowledged \nthe largest debt owed in SOR \u00b6 1.a to the government investigator and then denied it. He \nfailed to contact the creditor as he said he would. Applicant repeatedly provided \ncontradictory statements and testimony. He has an unreliable financial track record. \nAlthough he eventually paid some debts or is paying them, he was aware they were \nlegitimate, but did not attempt to resolve them until after he received the SOR. The record \nevidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.
